<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the denial of anticipatory bail to certain appellants. The ED had not arrested the accused shown in the complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA till the complaint was filed. The appeals were made on this fact situation.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the appellants are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that they argued against the denial of anticipatory bail and sought its grant.
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that after cognizance is taken of the offence punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA based on a complaint under Section 44 (1)(b), the ED and its officers are powerless to exercise power under Section 19 to arrest a person shown as an accused in the complaint.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, setting aside the impugned orders declining to grant anticipatory bail. It directed that warrants issued by the Special Courts against the appellants shall stand cancelled subject to certain conditions: (i) The appellants shall appear before the concerned Special Court within one month from today and file an undertaking; (ii) The appellants shall furnish bonds in accordance with Section 88 of the CrPC to the satisfaction of the Special Court within one month from today. It clarified that the warrants shall be cancelled only if compliance is made as aforesaid within one month from today.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Rajasthan government imposed stamp duty on policies of insurance, and the appellant company was ordered to purchase India Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state. The appellant company made every endeavour to purchase the stamps from within the state but was unable to do so due to the lack of mechanism for payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability of insurance stamps.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the appellant company argued that they had no choice but to purchase the insurance stamps from outside the state due to the unavailability of them within the state.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court failed to consider subsection (4) of Section 3A, which excludes instruments under Entry 91, List I from the application of Section 3A. The appellant company had no choice but to purchase the insurance stamps from outside the state due to the lack of mechanism for payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability of insurance stamps.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

I. The preliminary issue relating to the applicability of the relevant state law, i.e., the 1952 Act or the 1998 Act, is answered by holding that the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 applies to the present case.

II. We hold that the state legislature has the legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III, as per the rate prescribed by the Parliament under Entry 91 of List I.

III. We hold that for the execution of insurance policies within the state of Rajasthan, the appellant is bound to purchase India Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state of Rajasthan.

IV. While we have upheld the power and jurisdiction of the state to levy and collect stamp duty on insurance policies, in the facts and circumstances of the case as indicated hereinabove, we direct that the state government shall not demand and collect the stamp duty as per the orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The election petitioner filed an application seeking leave to file a replication in response to the returned candidate's written statement. The returned candidate had made several new averments and explanations in his written statement, which the election petitioner wanted to address in the replication.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
There were no specific arguments presented by the parties involved in the case. However, it can be inferred that the election petitioner argued that the returned candidate's written statement raised new facts that needed a reply, and therefore, leave to file a replication was justified.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the replication did not seek to incorporate any new material facts or a new cause of action to question the election. It only sought to explain the averments made in the written statement.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court dismissed the appeal, holding that leave to file a replication was justified and within its discretionary jurisdiction. The court stated that the replication did not seek to introduce new material facts or causes of action but only sought to explain the averments made in the written statement.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a chargesheet submitted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against certain respondents under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The respondents are accused of involvement in alleged terrorist activities and have been charged with serious offenses. The chargesheet has already been submitted to the Special Court, and the trial is pending.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant-NIA argued that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against the respondents were prima facie true. They contended that the mandate contained in the proviso to Section 43(D)(5) of UAPA would be applicable, and the respondents should not be released on bail.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that national security is always of paramount importance, and any act in aid to a terrorist act – violent or non-violent – is liable to be restricted. The Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) has been enacted to provide for effective prevention of certain unlawful activities and to deal with terrorist activities.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court, which had granted bail to the respondents. The respondents are directed to forthwith surrender themselves before the appellant-NIA. The Special Court is directed to proceed with the trial as expeditiously as possible and in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) developer, who has been granted the status of a deemed distribution licensee by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC). The appellant was required to make an application in accordance with the 2013 Regulations and had fulfilled this condition. However, the TSERC imposed a condition that the promoters infuse additional capital of Rs. 26.90 crore.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The TSERC relied on regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations to enforce the applicability of rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules, which requires an applicant to comply with certain provisions, including making a payment of Rs. 26.90 crore as additional capital. However, the appellant argued that it was not a regular applicant but a deemed distribution licensee, and therefore exempt from complying with these regulations.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations is applicable only to applicants who come within the purview of regulations 4 to 11. Since the appellant was not a regular applicant but a deemed distribution licensee, it would be exempt from complying with regulation 12. The TSERC's reliance on regulation 49 of the 2013 Regulations also appears to be flawed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that being a SEZ developer in terms of the 2010 Notification does not ipso facto confer upon the appellant the status of a deemed licensee without any scrutiny and without being under any requirement to apply. The court allowed the appeal partly, setting aside the condition stipulated by the TSERC for infusing additional capital of Rs. 26.90 crore. The order granting the status of a deemed licensee was modified to exclude this condition.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondents, who were accused of a double murder, had been in custody for less than three years. They had also filed a cross-FIR, but the police had filed a closure report. The complainant in the cross-FIR had protested and moved an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C against the complainant in the cross-FIR.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (State of UP) and the respondent's counsel argued that the respondents did not deserve bail, citing several factors:
- The respondents had been in custody for less than three years for a serious offense like double murder.
- The police had filed a closure report in the cross-FIR.
- The complainant in the cross-FIR had protested and moved an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C against the complainant in the cross-FIR.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The respondents' bail applications were not meritorious, given their serious offense and short period of custody.
- The police's closure report in the cross-FIR and the complainant's protest petition were relevant factors to consider.
- The respondents had already spent less than three years in custody for a double murder charge, which was relatively short.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- All four impugned orders granting bail to the respondents were quashed and set aside.
- The respondents were directed to surrender within two weeks from the date of passing of this order.
- The observations made above were limited to examining infirmities in the impugned orders and should not be treated as an opinion on the merits of the matter, which was still pending trial.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the legality of reporting conditions imposed by the authorities. The court is considering whether these conditions are directory or mandatory.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments made by the parties are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the cases cited (numbers 23-36), it appears that both sides have argued over whether reporting conditions are directory (meaning they can be complied with) or mandatory (meaning they must be strictly adhered to).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court has observed and analyzed previous case laws related to this issue. The observations suggest that the court is weighing the importance of following specific procedures versus flexibility in reporting.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that "Information not available" as no explicit ruling or decision is mentioned in the provided text regarding the case at hand.

However, based on the context and the list of cases cited (numbers 23-36), it can be inferred that the court's judgment would likely side with the interpretation that reporting conditions are directory rather than mandatory. This conclusion is drawn from the majority of the cited cases supporting this view.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the issue of recovering loans from State Financial Corporations through various revenue recovery Acts in different states. The court is considering whether the statutory bar on recovery of amounts due after a certain period of time affects the civil remedies of these corporations to recover such arrears.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

*   The existence of the right to the debtor under Section 70(3) of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act and Section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003 is considered determinative of the issue.
*   The classification in the U.P. Act, similar to the Haryana Revenue Recovery Act or the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act, was enacted with the object to have speedy recovery of dues.
*   The statutory bar on recovery of electricity dues after the limitation period of two years provided under Section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003 would have an implication on the civil remedies of the Electric Utilities to recover such arrears.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

*   The applicability of V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) to Section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003 recently fell for consideration before a three-judge Bench of this Court in K.C. Ninan v. Kerala State Electricity Board.
*   The court noticed the decision in V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) and concluded that statute of limitation only barred a remedy, while the right to recover the loan through ‘any other suitable manner provided’ remains untouched.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:

*   In view of what has been pointed out hereinabove, we are of the opinion that, for a comprehensive consideration and an authoritative pronouncement after taking into account all aspects, including those dealt with hereinabove, the matter needs to be placed before the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate three-judge bench.
*   Let the papers along with this order be placed before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for seeking appropriate directions from His Lordship, in this regard.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the Uttar Pradesh Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. The State had invoked this Act against the appellants in a First Information Report (FIR) namely CC No.0092/2023. The FIR was registered based on three criminal cases (CCs) lodged by private parties against the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the appellants argued that the State's invocation of the Act was premature and uncalled for, as the complainant(s)/informant(s) in the CCs had resorted to their remedies under criminal law. The counsel also pointed out that there was no mention of any instance, post-registration of the said CCs, of the appellants implementing/acting on the alleged threats.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that despite the complainant(s)/informant(s) resorting to their remedies under criminal law and civil proceedings, the State had chosen to invoke the Act. The Court noted that there was no instance of the appellants implementing/acting on the alleged threats post-registration of the CCs.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the FIR (CC No.0092/2023) stood quashed. The Impugned Judgment was set aside, and proceedings consequential to CC No.0092/2023 were effaced. However, it was clarified that the observations made by the Court were only on the issues arising in this case and not definitive re the pending CCs or civil proceeding(s).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent was granted bail in a case registered under sections 364, 302, and 34 of the IPC. The respondent has been involved in three other cases, but has been acquitted or enlarged on bail in two of them. The respondent is also accused in an NIA case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant-state contended that the order granting bail should be set aside due to the respondent's involvement in other cases and the threat posed to witnesses. The respondent argued that the conditions stipulated for bail have not been violated and that the respondent has been granted bail in previous cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the respondent having been enlarged on bail conditionally and the conditions so stipulated having not been violated, and the appellant-state having not sought cancellation of the bail till date. The court also observed that there are no other overwhelming material on record to set aside the order granting bail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal and held that interference is not warranted. The court gave liberty to the prosecution to seek cancellation of the bail in the event any of the conditions being violated by the respondent, and observed that the jurisdictional court shall proceed to adjudicate the case on merits after trial.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an acquisition under the Acquisition Act, 2013. The market value of the land must be computed to determine the compensation. Clause (a) of Section 26(1) applies, which requires the application of the market value specified under the Stamp Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, argued that the circle rate is not the baseline or floor rate and is too high. The Commissioner applied the Collector's Guidelines by using the rate provided for non-converted agricultural land and supplemented this amount by accounting for the assets attached to the land and adding the solatium payable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the compensation has been calculated in accordance with the mandate of the Acquisition Act, 2013. The circle rate is a market value specified under the Stamp Act, which must be used as the basis for determining the compensation. It is the responsibility of the public authorities to ensure that circle rates are neither inflated nor disproportionately low.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the computation in the award passed by the Commissioner directing payment of compensation on the basis of the circle rate is correct. The appeals filed by the appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, are dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a writ petition filed by two women judicial officers, Sarita Chaudhary and Aditi Kumar Sharma, who were terminated from their service. The petitioners alleged that they were discriminated against due to their gender and medical conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the termination orders were arbitrary and violated the principles of natural justice. They also contended that the respondents failed to consider their medical conditions, including Aditi Kumar Sharma's severe case of Covid-19 and miscarriage, while taking disciplinary action against them.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court noted that the growing number of female judicial officers is not sufficient if they are unable to secure a sensitive work environment and guidance. The Court observed that the High Court erred in acting agnostic to the petitioners' claims of insubordination and medical conditions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court set aside the termination orders and reinstated the petitioners with all consequential benefits. The respondents were directed to declare their probation as on the date their juniors were confirmed, and the petitioners were entitled to monetary benefits for the period of termination calculated notionally for pensionary benefits.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals against the judgments passed by a High Court in relation to execution petitions. The appellants are seeking vacant and peaceful possession of a suit property.
The appeals have been filed under various sections of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) and the Specific Relief Act, 1963.
The matter has been pending for an extended period, and the executing court has failed to dispose of the execution proceedings within six months from the date of filing as mandated by law.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' counsel argued that the High Court's judgments were incorrect in law and that the executing court had not followed the proper procedure for disposal of execution petitions.
The appellants sought a direction to the executing court to hand over vacant and peaceful possession of the suit property to them within two months from the date of the order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the executing courts have failed to comply with the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the matter of disposal of execution petitions within six months from the date of filing.
The Court noted that the pendency of execution petitions is a matter of great concern and that efforts must be made to dispose of these matters at the earliest.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals, set aside the judgments passed by the High Court, and directed the executing court to hand over vacant and peaceful possession of the suit property to the appellants within two months from the date of the order.
The Court also directed all the High Courts across the country to call for information regarding the pendency of execution petitions and to issue administrative orders to ensure that these matters are disposed of within six months from the date of filing.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the procedure prescribed under Section 52A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. The court was dealing with an appeal related to a trial involving charges of possession and recovery of contraband substances.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented in the case were centered around the compliance or non-compliance with the procedure prescribed under Section 52A of the NDPS Act, particularly regarding the handling and production of physical evidence. The prosecution had argued that substantial compliance with the procedure was sufficient to validate the trial, while the defense contended that any procedural lapses would render the trial vulnerable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the procedure prescribed under Section 52A is intended to guide officers in charge of investigations and ensure a fair process. However, the court also noted that substantial compliance with the procedure was sufficient, rather than strict adherence. The court further emphasized the importance of considering the cumulative effect of discrepancies in evidence and procedural lapses when determining the validity of the trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal, ruling that while non-compliance or delayed compliance with Section 52A may lead to an adverse inference against the prosecution, it would not necessarily render the trial invalid. The court also clarified that the standard of proof required for the prosecution to prove substantial compliance with the procedure is beyond a reasonable doubt.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The CMJ University appointed a Chancellor without following the procedure prescribed under Section 14(1) of the Act. The State Government dissolved the university on March 31, 2014, citing non-compliance with the procedural requirements.
The appellants (CMJ University and its officials) challenged the dissolution order in court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the appellants:

*   The procedure prescribed under Section 14(1) of the Act was not followed for the appointment of the Chancellor, but this is irrelevant to the legitimacy of the dissolution order.
*   The dissolution order was passed with strict adherence to procedural requirements and in compliance with court directions.

Arguments presented by the State Government:

*   The CMJ University failed to comply with the procedural requirements outlined under Section 48 of the Act.
*   The appointment of the Chancellor was invalid due to non-compliance with Section 14(1) of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the dissolution order was passed in compliance with procedural requirements and court directions.
The court also noted that the CMJ University's appointment of a Chancellor without following the prescribed procedure is a separate issue from the legitimacy of the dissolution order.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the decision to dissolve the CMJ University, citing strict adherence to procedural requirements and compliance with court directions.
The court also ruled that the division bench's decision to remand the matter to the single judge was legally flawed and untenable.
The court dismissed Civil Appeal No. 9694 of 2024 and allowed Civil Appeal No. 9695 of 2024, setting aside the direction to remand the matter to the single bench.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the implementation of guidelines for the execution of death sentences in India. The court has directed various parties, including the Sessions Court, State Public Prosecutor, investigating agency, and convicts, to follow specific procedures.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court has observed that there are issues with the implementation of death sentences in India, including delays and lack of transparency. The court has directed the Sessions Court to implement guidelines for listing disposed-off cases and issuing warrants for execution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
1. The Supreme Court directs the Sessions Courts to follow specific guidelines when dealing with cases involving death sentences.
2. The court orders that a note be taken as soon as the order of the High Court confirming or imposing the death sentence is received, and the disposed-off case should be listed on the cause list.
3. Notice must be issued to the State Public Prosecutor or investigating agency to ascertain whether any appeal or special leave petition has been preferred before this Court and what is the outcome of the said petition/appeal.
4. If the State Public Prosecutor or investigating agency reports that the appeal is pending, the Sessions Court should keep on listing the disposed-off case after intervals of one month so that it gets the information about the status of the pending petitions.
5. Before issuing a warrant for execution, notice must be issued to the convict, and directions issued by the Allahabad High Court in the case of People’s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) shall be implemented by the Sessions Court.
6. The Sessions Courts should consider what is held in Paragraph 25 above.
7. Copies of the order issuing the warrant and the warrant shall be immediately provided to the convicts, and the Prison authorities must explain the implications thereof to the convicts.

8. There shall be a gap of fifteen clear days between the date of receipt of the order as well as warrant by the convict and the actual date of execution.
9. It shall also be the responsibility of the concerned State Government or Union Territory administration to apply to the Sessions Court for the issuance of a warrant immediately after the death penalty attains finality and becomes enforceable.
10. A copy of this judgment shall be forwarded to both the convicts through the Jail Superintendent of the concerned jail.
11. A copy of this judgment shall be forwarded to the Registrar Generals of all the High Courts, who in turn shall forward the copies thereof to all the Sessions Courts.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over land acquisition and compensation for landowners. The land was acquired by the State government under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The landowners had sold their lands to the developer for residential purposes, but the State government acquired the land for industrial purposes.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (landowners) argued that the compensation awarded by the State government was inadequate and did not take into account the market value of the land. They also contended that the CLU rates paid by them should be adjusted to determine the fair market value of the land.
The State government, on the other hand, argued that the land acquisition was done in accordance with law and that the compensation awarded was reasonable. It also claimed that the CLU rates paid by the landowners were a one-time payment and did not affect the market value of the land.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Bench cited the judgment of Besco (supra) to determine the market value of the land. The observations in this case highlighted the importance of considering the CLU rates paid by the landowners while determining the fair market value of the land.
The court also noted that the delay in filing/delay in refiling after delayed filing of the appeal(s) would not entitle the appellants to interest.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Bench set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 20.09.2022 and partly allowed the appeals. The appellants were awarded a sum of Rs.1,18,37,668/- per acre as compensation, along with statutory benefits under Section 23(1-A), 23(2) & 28 of the LA Act in accordance with law after deducting the amounts already paid.
The court also stated that Civil Appeal Nos. arising out of the Special Leave Petitions would be covered by the Besco (supra) judgment, but the appellants would not be entitled to interest for the period of delay in filing/delay in refiling after delayed filing of the appeal(s).
</JUDGMENT>

<FUNCTIOINAL CASE SUMMARY IS NOT AVAILABLE AS THE GIVEN TEXT DOESN'T CONTAIN A CLEARLY DEFINED CASE WITH SPECIFIC FACTS, ARGUMENTS, OBSERVATIONS AND JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, I CAN PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE GIVEN TEXT BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION>

<PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS>

The given text appears to be a legal judgment or a decision rendered by the Supreme Court of India in a case with the SLP(C) No. 19226/2022. The text discusses the jurisdiction of civil courts to try suits based on title to property under the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation.

</PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff had claimed their title to the property, and the defendant had taken the plea of bar under Section 154(1)(a) of the Regulation. However, the High Court held that the provision did not preclude civil courts from entertaining suits based on title to the property.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Gauhati High Court had observed in a previous case (Ka Trily Tariang v. U. Resdrikson Lyngdoh and Ors.) that the jurisdiction conferred upon Revenue authority does not prevent civil courts from adjudicating upon the right to an asset when entitlement is claimed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, and restored the order dated 16.05.2014 passed by the Civil Judge, Nagaon.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants' shares were transferred to the State Government in 1973. The appellants instituted a suit in 1978 claiming a valuation of Rs.70.50 per share, which was later increased to Rs.874/- per share based on a private valuer's report. The High Court and this Court affirmed a valuation of Rs.640/- per share. The Respondent No. 1 agreed to pay a fair valuation for the shares but has yet to make the payment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants claimed interest at 18% with quarterly rest or 15% with monthly rest, which was considered unreasonable by the Court. The Court noted that the discretion to award interest must be guided by equitable considerations and cannot be applied mechanically or at an unreasonably high rate.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The prolonged pendency of the dispute regarding the valuation of shares has resulted in a substantial delay, and the appellants are entitled to reasonable compensation by way of interest. The Court observed that the award must balance fairness and financial impact, taking into account the "loss of use" principle and economic prudence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court awarded simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum from 8th July 1975 on the enhanced valuation of shares till the date of decree and interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of decree till the date of realisation. The interest is to be paid along with the amount due towards the enhanced value of the shares, after adjusting the amount already paid, within a period of two months.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the appointment of Assistant Professors in universities and colleges, as per the regulations framed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Respondent 1 had filed a writ petition challenging the selection process, claiming that it was unfair and discriminatory.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved were as follows:

* The Division Bench of the High Court held that the selection process was not in conformity with the regulations framed by the UGC. They observed that teaching experience was given undue importance, which led to a bias against candidates who did not have sufficient teaching experience.
* The appellants argued that the regulation allowed for direct recruitment based on various criteria, including teaching experience and post-doctoral research experience. They contended that the selection process was fair and transparent.
* The Division Bench also observed that there was an anomaly in the awarding of marks for post-doctoral experience, which was not properly defined or plead by respondent 1.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The court noted that teaching experience was not a mandatory eligibility criterion, but rather one of several factors considered during the selection process.
* The Division Bench observed that the criteria for shortlisting candidates were in line with the UGC regulations and aimed to ensure that suitable candidates were selected for the posts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court states:

* The impugned order of the Division Bench is unsustainable in law and deserves to be set aside.
* The writ petition filed by respondent 1 is dismissed, as well as her special appeal challenging the dismissal of her writ petition.
* The review petition filed by respondent 1 also stands dismissed.
* All the appeals stand allowed without any orders for costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the selection process for 104 Constables in the Armed Forces (Police) Frontier (AFPF). The appellants, who were selected through a previous recruitment process, had their select list canceled by the successor government. They filed a writ petition against this decision.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they had a right to question any decision adverse to their interest affecting achievement of their goals to secure public employment. They also contended that the absence of grant of legitimacy to the select list by way of an approval from the Government did not infringe upon their legal rights.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there were materials providing sufficient justification for the successor government to cancel the select list. The court also noted that the selection process had been abandoned mid-way, and such a decision must not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or the whims of the decision-maker.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allowed the civil appeal, quashing the impugned judgment(s) and order(s) of the High Court. The appellants were granted liberty to take forward the process of filling up 104 Constables in the AFPF by publishing a fresh advertisement, with certain concessions being made for the respondents.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals related to the payment of royalty by Steel Authority of India (SAIL) to the Mineral Area Development Authority (MADA). The appellants challenged the order of the Bihar High Court, which had held that the payments made by SAIL to MADA were in the nature of royalty and not a tax. The Supreme Court was required to determine whether the payments constituted royalty or tax.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:

* The appellants argued that the payments made by SAIL to MADA were in the nature of tax, as they were recovered under the Bihar and Orissa Public Demands Recovery Act, 1914.
* The respondents (MADA) argued that the payments constituted royalty, which was a contractual consideration paid for the enjoyment of mineral rights. They relied on various Supreme Court judgments, including State of H.P. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd., which held that royalty is not a tax but a payment for the use of rights.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations made in the case include:

* The Supreme Court noted that there are major conceptual differences between royalty and tax, including the nature of the consideration paid and the relationship between the payer and payee.
* The court observed that royalty is a contractual consideration paid for the use of rights, whereas tax is an imposition by the state.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that both royalty and dead rent do not fulfill the characteristics of tax or impost. The court concluded that the observation in India Cement (supra) to the effect that royalty is a tax is incorrect.

The judgment states: "We hold that both royalty and dead rent do not fulfil the characteristics of tax or impost. Accordingly, we conclude that the observation in India Cement (supra) to the effect that royalty is a tax is incorrect."

The court also relied on its earlier judgments in State of H.P. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. and Indsil Hydro Power & Manganese Ltd. v. State of Kerala, which held that royalty is not a tax but a payment for the use of rights.

Finally, the court directed that parties shall bear their own costs.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the protection and conservation of sacred groves in India. The court is concerned with ensuring that these groves are protected from encroachment, deforestation, and other harmful activities.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is responsible for creating policies and programs to protect the rights of communities dependent on these forests.
A village called Piplantri demonstrates how community-driven initiatives can effectively address social, economic, and environmental challenges.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court has been petitioned to consider the protection and conservation of sacred groves in India. The petitioners argue that these groves are not only ecologically significant but also hold cultural and spiritual importance for local communities.
They claim that government policies have failed to effectively protect these groves, leading to encroachment, deforestation, and other forms of destruction.
The court is asked to direct the authorities to implement measures to safeguard these groves and involve local communities in their conservation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The National Forest Policy, 1988, highlights the importance of involving people with customary rights in forests to help protect and improve forest ecosystems.
Models like Piplantri village demonstrate effective community-driven initiatives for addressing social, economic, and environmental challenges.
Sacred groves in different States are managed differently, some relying on village panchayats or local bodies while others rely solely on community traditions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the authorities to ensure implementation of directions given in para-Nos. 53 to 57 of this judgment in letter and spirit.
Suggestions mentioned at para-No. 58 shall also be considered during implementation.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India, Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan are directed to file a compliance report regarding constitution of the Committee as mentioned in para-Nos. 56 and 57 of this judgment.
List the matter on 10.01.2025 for receiving the compliance report to this limited extent.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent/plaintiff filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell dated 26.04.1991 in the year 1993 itself, which was rejected on 12.01.1998. The plaintiff could have filed the second suit on or before 12.01.2001 as it got right to file the suit on 12.01.1998 on the rejection of the plaint in the earlier suit filed by it.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent/plaintiff argued that the limitation period expired in January, 2001 itself and the second suit was filed belatedly in the year 2007. The cause of action had faded and paled into oblivion, and the right to sue stood extinguished.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that once time has begun to run, it will run continuously but time ceases to run when the plaintiff commences legal proceedings in respect of the cause of action in question. The Indian law also follows the English law, and intervention of court in proceedings would prevent the period of limitation from running.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the second suit was barred under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code as it was filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation as per Article 113 to the Schedule to the Limitation Act. The plaint in O.S No.49/2007 filed by the respondent herein was rejected even in the absence of any evidence being recorded on the issue of limitation.

<FACTS>
A lawyer, Mr. P.Soma Sundaram, filed two Special Leave Petitions (Criminal) - one on January 31st, 2025, and another on February 21st, 2025 - against the same order dated September 29th, 2023, passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras in Criminal Appeal No. 618 of 2011.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the lawyer's action of filing two petitions against the same order was considered a misconduct by the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Both Advocates have expressed their remorse with a promise not to repeat the misconduct in future.
Several eminent leaders of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), Office Bearers of the SCBA and Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) have appealed to this Court for mercy.
Suspending an Advocate -on-Record for a period of one month would cast a stigma on the future of the Advocate-on-Record. It is said that Mr. P.Soma Sundaram, Advocate-on-Record, comes from a very remote village in the State of Tamil Nadu and this stigma can possibly cost him his entire future.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The unconditional apology tendered by the Advocates expressing remorse and promise made by them not to repeat the misconduct in future is accepted. They are warned of and directed to be careful in not repeating any such misconduct in future. They are also directed to ensure that they shall appear before all cases where they have entered appearances.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a preliminary inquiry under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act) and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The Superintendent of Police issued an order on 4th December, 2023, directing the registration of an FIR for crimes committed under the PC Act. The order also authorized the Deputy Superintendent of Police to conduct an investigation into these crimes.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that the Superintendent of Police's order was passed directly under Section 17 of the PC Act, thereby violating its mandatory provisions. They contended that a preliminary inquiry is necessary in every case under the PC Act.
The appellants, on the other hand, argued that the Superintendent of Police has the authority to direct the registration of an FIR for cognizable offenses, even without conducting a preliminary inquiry. They also pointed out that Section 17 of the PC Act places limitations only on the investigation process and does not impede the duty of law enforcement agencies to record and register FIRs.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had imposed administrative frameworks that could potentially incapacitate law enforcement agencies. The court held that the Superintendent of Police's order was directly passed under Section 17 of the PC Act, which led to this issue.
In contrast, the Supreme Court observed that a preliminary inquiry may be avoided if a superior officer is in possession of a source information report that prima facie discloses the commission of a cognizable offense. The court also emphasized that the Superintendent of Police has the authority to direct the registration of an FIR for cognizable offenses and can simultaneously direct another officer to conduct an investigation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashing and setting aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court. The court held that the Superintendent of Police's authority to issue a composite order directing registration of the FIR and authorizing another officer to conduct an investigation is valid in law.
The court also emphasized that Section 17 of the PC Act places limitations only on the investigation process and does not impede the fundamental duty of law enforcement agencies to record and register FIRs for cognizable offenses. As a result, the Supreme Court ordered the restoration of the FIR pending before the 23rd Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bangalore City.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The West Bengal Public Service Commission (PSC) conducted a competitive examination for various posts. However, the examination was marred by irregularities and malpractices, including questions being leaked on social media and candidates being given prior access to the question paper. As a result, the entire selection process was declared null and void by the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the decision of the High Court was incorrect and that the selection process should not be declared null and void. They contended that the irregularities were minor and did not affect the outcome of the examination.

On the other hand, the respondents (the State of West Bengal) argued that the irregularities were serious and had compromised the integrity of the examination process. They contended that declaring the selection process null and void was the only way to maintain the fairness and transparency of the recruitment process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the irregularities in the examination process were indeed serious and had undermined the credibility of the entire selection process.

The court also noted that the High Court's decision to declare the selection process null and void was justified, given the gravity of the irregularities.

Furthermore, the court highlighted the importance of maintaining the integrity and transparency of public examinations, particularly in the context of government recruitments.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the High Court to declare the selection process null and void. However, it modified some of the directions issued by the High Court.

The court cancelled all appointments made under the disputed selection process and directed that the services of those appointed be terminated.

However, candidates who were already employed in different departments or autonomous bodies would not have to refund any payments made to them. They could rejoin their previous positions and their seniority and entitlements would be preserved.

Additionally, supernumerary posts may be created for persons appointed in the interregnum.

Lastly, disabled candidates who had been appointed under the disputed selection process would be allowed to continue and receive wages until a fresh selection process was completed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the examination of procedures for appointing advocates-on-record in the Supreme Court of India. The Registrar (Judicial) of the court is required to examine applications and conduct an examination for appointment as advocates-on-record. Shri Rishi Malhotra's case was pending, and he had submitted his application on December 22, 2023.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court observed that there were issues with the examination process, including the lack of transparency in the evaluation process and inconsistent communication to applicants about deficiencies. The office bearers of SCAORA suggested adopting a consistent approach regarding notifying deficiencies and objections in cases filed, regularizing open houses for discussions on processes adopted by the Registry, and clearing bottlenecks in filing registration and verification of cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that if any advocate-on-record commits misconduct or is guilty of conduct unbecoming of an advocate-on-record, action against them as per Rule 10 of Order IV is warranted. The office bearers of SCAORA suggested the conduct of the examination for advocates-on-record be improved to prevent such issues.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the Registrar (Judicial) to place a copy of this judgment before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India, with consideration for whether the issues flagged by the court deserve to be considered by a Bench of appropriate strength. The Registry was also instructed to interact regularly with the office bearers of SCAORA and sort out the issues raised by the Association.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court highlights several key points:
* The role of a teacher is crucial in guiding students on how to differentiate between right and wrong, especially in the context of social media and online safety.
* Teachers have a responsibility to educate students about the safe use of technology.
* The family also learns from a student's education, and teachers should be aware of this impact.
* The court emphasizes the importance of avoiding litigation for candidates selected for Assistant Teacher positions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the AMP Group and the SRG Group regarding an arbitration agreement. The parties are involved in a family arrangement agreement, and there is a demand of Rs. 25 crore made by the SRG Group as a condition for exit from Deegee. The petitioner (AMP Group) has moved to the court under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, seeking appointment of an arbitrator.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The AMP Group argued that the SRG Group participated in the negotiation and performance of the underlying contract and can be bound by the arbitration agreement. The petitioner contended that the nomenclature of the agreement (Family Arrangement Agreement) is not determinative of its character. The SRG Group, on the other hand, argued that it has not agreed to the underlying contract and therefore cannot be bound by the arbitration agreement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that determining whether the SRG Group is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement requires a detailed examination of evidence. The court also noted that under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, it should not conduct a mini-trial and delve into contested or disputed questions of fact.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the petition and appointed Mr. Akil Kureshi (Former Chief Justice, High Court of Rajasthan) to act as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator and other modalities were left to be fixed in consultation with the parties. It was made clear that all the rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.

The case involves the murder of two individuals, Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu. The accused are Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8). The High Court had acquitted all the accused except for Mantu Tiwari and Vijay Kumar Shukla, who were convicted by the trial court under Sections 302 and 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the accused had planned and executed the murders. However, the defense argued that there was not enough evidence to prove their involvement in the crimes.

The High Court acquitted all the accused except for Mantu Tiwari and Vijay Kumar Shukla, citing a lack of sufficient evidence against them. The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court's decision regarding Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), and Rajan Tiwari (A-9).

However, the prosecution argued that Mantu Tiwari and Vijay Kumar Shukla had planned and executed the murders. The Supreme Court agreed with this argument and convicted Mantu Tiwari and Vijay Kumar Shukla under Sections 302 and 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case highlights the importance of sufficient evidence in proving a person's involvement in crimes.

The High Court and Supreme Court decisions demonstrate that the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The courts also emphasized the need for strict adherence to legal procedures and the rule of law.

It is observed that the trial court had convicted Mantu Tiwari and Vijay Kumar Shukla, but their conviction was upheld by the High Court. However, the Supreme Court set aside the judgment in part, acquitting all the accused except for Mantu Tiwari and Vijay Kumar Shukla.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC against Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) for the murders of Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu was proven and established beyond reasonable doubt.

The Court also held that the charge under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC against Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) for attempting to murder, as held in paragraph 34 above, was proven and established beyond reasonable doubt.

The conviction and sentence awarded to Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) by the trial court under Sections 302 and 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC were affirmed and restored. Consequently, Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) shall have to undergo imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs. 20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand Only) each under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC.

<Facts>
The case involves a land acquisition dispute in the Yamuna Expressway project. The State of Uttar Pradesh invoked the urgency clause under Sections 17(1) and 17(4) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The acquisition proceedings were challenged by some landowners who approached the High Court and later the Supreme Court.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the landowners argued against the invocation of the urgency clause and sought higher compensation for their lands. The State, on the other hand, defended its action and claimed that the acquisition was necessary for a public purpose.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court noted that the majority of landowners had accepted the escalated compensation granted by the High Court in Kamal Sharma's case. The Court also observed that even when it held the invocation of the urgency clause to be illegal, it still upheld the acquisition proceedings and directed enhancement of compensation in previous cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by YEIDA (Yamuna Expressway Industrial Authority) and dismissed the appeals filed by the landowners. The Court held that the invocation of the urgency clause was justified under the circumstances. Additionally, the Court directed that a 64.7% enhancement in compensation shall apply uniformly to all affected landowners as per the Government order dated 4th November, 2015.

The case involves a dispute over the applicability of a Mega Power Status granted to a project under the Mega Power Policy. The project was eligible for benefits from 16.04.2010, but the Ministry of Power granted the status on 30.07.2010.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* Appellant's argument: The press release of 01.10.2009 and subsequent notifications issued by the concerned Ministries on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009 created a new legal regime, making the Mega Power Status applicable from that date.
* Respondent's argument: The decision to grant the Mega Power Status was taken on 01.10.2009, but it was not implemented until 30.07.2010, when the status was granted to the project under the Mega Power Policy.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:

* The press release of 01.10.2009 and subsequent notifications were merely preparatory steps towards implementing the decision to grant the Mega Power Status.
* The decision to grant the status was taken on 06.02.2013, and the relevant date for change in law is 26.07.2013, when the Office Memorandum providing further instructions regarding the implementation of the New Coal Distributional Policy (NCDP) was issued.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

* The press release of 01.10.2009 and subsequent notifications do not create a new legal regime, making the Mega Power Status applicable from that date.
* The benefits under the Mega Power Policy are applicable only from 30.07.2010, when the status was granted to the project.

The Civil Appeal is dismissed, with no order as to costs.

<FACTS>
The case involves a state legislation and its implementation in the State of Maharashtra. The statute is intended to benefit marginalized and impoverished individuals, but it has failed to ameliorate their conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The judiciary argues that it has a role in facilitating access to justice and effective functioning of constitutional bodies, beyond just reviewing executive and legislative actions. The court believes that the statutory scheme has gridlocked in bureaucratic or judicial quagmires, impeding or delaying statutory objectives.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The overwhelming majority of legislations are introduced and carried through by the Government, with very few private member bills being introduced and debated.
- The statute has failed to ameliorate the conditions of the beneficiaries, as demonstrated by judicial data or other cogent material.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the Ld. Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court to constitute a bench to initiate suo motu proceedings for reviewing the working of the statute. The concerned bench will hear the government, statutory authorities, stakeholders, and intended beneficiaries, with the assistance of senior members of the bar as amici curae. The court leaves it to the High Court to devise methods for conducting the review. If necessary, the bench may consider directing the government to constitute a committee for performance audit of the Act.

<Facts>
The case revolves around the online appearance of advocates in court proceedings. The Supreme Court Registry issued a circular on December 30, 2022, allowing Advocates-on-Record to mark appearances of "advocates appearing in court." This instruction was seen as placing an onerous responsibility on the Advocates-on-Record to provide information about the advocate present in the case.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
Information not available
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Coordinate Bench observed that furnishing online information by advocates who are not present in court may have a bearing on the sanctity of court proceedings and could lead to adverse impacts on regular Bar members. They directed that only those advocates appearing or assisting during hearing should have their online presence marked.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court directed that Advocates-on-Record must mark appearances of only those advocates who are authorized to appear and argue the case on a particular day of hearing. The names of arguing advocates should be provided by the Advocate-on-Record for each day of hearing, as instructed in the Notice/Circular dated 30.12.2022.

<FACTS>
The case involves three accused-appellants, Allarakha Habib Memon, Amin @ Lalo Aarifbhai Memon, and Mohmedfaruk @ Palak Safibhai Memon. They were convicted by the trial Court for a crime and sentenced accordingly. The accused-appellants preferred an appeal before the High Court, which was rejected. The case was then taken to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution examined several witnesses, including the Investigating Officer (PW-18), who deposed about the disclosure statements made by the accused-appellants leading to recoveries. However, the witness did not elaborate upon the words spoken by the accused-appellants at the time of making the disclosure statements.
The prosecution failed to present link evidence to establish that the recovered articles remained in safe custody from the date of seizure till they reached the FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory). The prosecution also failed to examine any witness who could depose about the link evidence/safe custody of the mudammal articles right from the time they were received at the police station and seized till the time the same reached the FSL.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that neither the disclosure statements made by the accused-appellants were proved as per law nor the same resulted into any discovery which could be accepted as incriminating. The court also observed that the prosecution failed to lead convincing evidence establishing the guilt of the accused-appellants beyond all manner of doubt.
The Supreme Court further observed that the evidence has not been properly appreciated, material aspects have been ignored, and the findings are perverse. Therefore, the court would certainly interfere with the findings of the courts below.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, quashed and set aside the impugned judgments dated 13th October, 2014, and 18th February, 2019 passed by the trial Court and the High Court, respectively. The accused-appellants were acquitted of the charges.
The court also ordered that Allarakha Habib Memon and Amin @ Lalo Aarifbhai Memon are on bail and need not surrender. Their bail bonds are discharged. Accused-appellant Mohmedfaruk @ Palak Safibhai Memon shall be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

<FACTS>
The buyer and sellers entered into an agreement, but the buyer was not "ready and willing" to perform her obligations. The trial court dismissed the suit instituted by the buyer, and the first appellate judgment and decree of the High Court were set aside.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the arguments presented included:
* The buyer's readiness and willingness to perform her obligations under the agreement.
* The jurisdictional fact touching the authority of the trial court to grant relief.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the judges include:
* The importance of satisfying oneself that the jurisdictional fact for grant of relief exists, particularly when dealing with issues related to assumption or refusal to assume jurisdiction.
* The higher court's power to examine and determine the existence of a jurisdictional fact, even if it was not raised in the trial court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:
"The appeals merit success and the same are allowed. We set aside the first appellate judgment and decree of the High Court and restore that of the Trial Court with the result that the suit instituted by the buyer shall stand dismissed." Additionally, it was ordered that the buyer shall be entitled to return of the advance sum of Rs.25 lakh by the sellers.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of accused appellants for various charges. The prosecution story is based on the testimony of Sachin Garg (PW-2), who claims to have been kidnapped and identified several accused persons, including Gaurav Bhalla (A2). However, during his cross-examination, Sachin Garg admitted that he was shown the accused persons by the officers of the CIA.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to provide trustworthy evidence to establish the recovery of currency notes at the instance of the accused. The disclosure statements were not proved as per law, and the currency notes were handed back to Mahesh Garg (PW-1) without any order of the Court.
The prosecution case was full of holes, making it impossible to sustain the conviction of the accused appellants.
The investigation agency failed to examine the most relevant witness, Shamlal Garg, which compelled the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court and trial Court failed to advert to the important loopholes and shortcomings in the evidence available on record, which are fatal and completely destroy the fabric of the prosecution case.
The accused were framed in the case for ulterior motive.
There is no iota of truth in the prosecution story, and it is a piece of fabrication.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This Court is of the firm opinion that the entire story of the prosecution is nothing but a piece of fabrication and the accused were framed in the case for ulterior motive. Therefore, the judgment dated 26th September, 2005 passed by the trial Court and the judgment dated 19th January, 2009 passed by the High Court are hereby quashed and set aside.
The appeals are accordingly allowed, and the appellants are acquitted of the charges. They are on bail and need not surrender. Their bail bonds are discharged.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two accused persons, Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (A1) and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel (A2), who were convicted by the trial Court and their conviction was affirmed by the High Court. The incident in question occurred at the Amraiwadi Police Station, where the victim, Jeeva, was detained. The prosecution's theory is that A1 and A2 assaulted Jeeva while he was being detained at the police station, leading to his fatal injuries.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's case relies heavily on the testimony of two key witnesses, PW-1 and PW-2, who attribute a motive to the accused police officials (A1 and A2) for assaulting Jeeva. However, the defense argues that this theory is not palpable and that the accused did not have any motive to assault Jeeva.
The defense also points out inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, including:
* The fact that the victim's clothes had red dust on them, which was consistent with the soil of Sabarmati Central jail
* The absence of any evidence of injuries being caused while Jeeva was lodged in the prison
* The failure of the Investigating Agency to investigate the possibility of injuries being caused in the prison
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of both accused persons by leading cogent, convincing, and reliable evidence. The trial Court's conviction was affirmed by the High Court, but the defense points out several inconsistencies in the prosecution's case.
The court also notes that it is imperative for the Investigating Agency to investigate all possible scenarios, including the possibility of injuries being caused while Jeeva was lodged in the prison.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court acquits both accused persons, Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (A1) and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel (A2), of the charges. The judgment dated 4th March, 1997 passed by the trial Court and the judgment dated 13th February, 2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court are quashed and set aside.
The appeal is allowed in these terms, and pending application(s) shall stand disposed of.

The case involves a prosecution under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against four individuals, including Satyendar Jain, Ankush Jain, Vaibhav Jain, and Unitech Ltd. 
They were accused of laundering money through various transactions involving shell companies and other entities.
Satyendar Jain was arrested on January 31, 2023, while Ankush Jain and Vaibhav Jain were arrested on February 23, 2023.
The respondents claimed that the prosecution had failed to prove their involvement in the alleged offenses under PMLA.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
They also claimed that the High Court's judgment was based on flawed reasoning and that the twin conditions laid down in Section 45 of PMLA were not complied with by the respondents.
However, the court observed that the declarations made by Ankush Jain and Vaibhav under the IDS had been misrepresented to mislead the Income Tax authorities, which raised prima facie suspicion against them.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that there was sufficient material collected by the respondent-ED (Enforcement Directorate) to show that the appellants were prima facie guilty of the alleged offenses under PMLA.
The High Court's judgment had also found the appellants guilty of the alleged offenses, and its reasoning did not suffer from any illegality or infirmity.
It was observed that the respondents had failed to comply with the twin conditions laid down in Section 45 of PMLA.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed all the appeals filed by the appellants, holding them guilty of the alleged offenses under PMLA.
The judgment stated that there were sufficient grounds for believing that they were not innocent and that the High Court's judgment was based on proper reasoning.
Satyendar Jain was ordered to surrender before the Special Court forthwith, as his bail had continued till this day.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a validation order dated 03.11.2017 passed by the Scrutiny Committee, granting a "Mochi" caste certificate to the Appellant based on her genealogical caste history of Appellant's forefathers.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had exercised its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and interfered with the order of the Scrutiny Committee, undertaking an erroneous exercise of appreciating evidence and swaying itself into a roving inquiry.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Appellant's caste claim was for "Mochi" based on her genealogical caste history, not based on her caste in some other State. The Scrutiny Committee had verified the claim of Appellant holding that Appellant belongs to "Mochi" caste in accordance with Entry 11 of Presidential Order as applicable to Maharashtra.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned judgment passed by the High Court, and restored the validation order dated 03.11.2017 passed by the Scrutiny Committee. The Court held that the Appellant's caste claim was within the exclusive domain of the Scrutiny Committee under Rule 13(2)(a) of 2012 Rules and that the High Court had erred in interfering with the order of the Scrutiny Committee.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Supreme Court of India heard a case related to the efficacy of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in elections. The petitioners raised concerns about the accuracy and transparency of EVMs, suggesting that they could be manipulated.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the petitioners included:
* EVMs are prone to manipulation and can be hacked easily
* Lack of transparency in the counting process makes it difficult to verify the results
* Alternative methods such as paper ballots or manual counting should be adopted
The respondents, on the other hand, argued that:
* EVMs have been used successfully in numerous elections with no significant issues reported
* The use of VVPAT (Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail) machines has increased transparency and accountability
* Reverting to paper ballots would increase costs and create logistical challenges
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The issue of EVMs had been raised previously, but the petitioners failed to provide substantial evidence to support their claims
* Blindly distrusting any aspect of the system can breed unwarranted skepticism and impede progress
* A critical yet constructive approach, guided by evidence and reason, is essential for making meaningful improvements
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court rejected the petitioners' demands to revert to paper ballots or manual counting. The court stated that:
* The EVM system has been in use for several years with no significant issues reported
* The use of VVPAT machines has increased transparency and accountability
* Any regressive measures would hinder progress and undermine the credibility of the electoral process
The court also emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced perspective when evaluating systems or institutions, urging all stakeholders to adopt a critical yet constructive approach.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the classification and confiscation of an imported product/oil. The product was sent for laboratory testing in three premier laboratories, but the test results were inconclusive. An expert opinion was also sought, but it could not be obtained definitively.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the Revenue/Customs Authority cannot take action against them based on inconclusive evidence. They requested that the benefit of doubt be given to them and the proceedings against them be quashed. The respondents argued that the product should be retested to obtain a conclusive finding.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the non-examination of any product/article/goods on all the parameters laid down by the customs authority will always lead to uncertainty and doubt, which are required to be removed when dealing with confiscatory proceedings. The court also noted that the dispute could have been avoided had the testing facilities for all the parameters been available.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals by setting aside the impugned common judgment and order dated 20.01.2022 passed in Revenue Tax Appeal No. 297 of 2021, Revenue Tax Appeal No. 298 of 2021, and Revenue Tax Appeal No. 299 of 2021. The court directed the respondents to ensure that proper facilities are made available in the appropriate laboratories for undertaking tests for all the parameters or at least for those parameters which the Authorities consider are of essential character to satisfy the "most akin" test without which the article in issue cannot be properly classified.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute regarding land acquisition for a project. The appellants (petitioners) filed a writ petition against the respondents (respondent nos. 1 to 7), challenging the land acquisition proceedings initiated by the State and KIADB. The appellants claimed that the delay in determining compensation and payment of the same was not attributable to them but to the inaction of the State and KIADB.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* The appellants argued that the delay in determining compensation and payment of the same was a violation of their constitutional right under Article 300-A, which protects the right to property.
* The respondents (State and KIADB) contended that the delay was not their responsibility but was due to the inaction of Respondent Nos. 6 and 7.
* Respondent Nos. 6 and 7 argued that they cannot be imposed with a liability for this huge additional expenditure, as it is not attributable to them.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court are as follows:

* The court observed that there was an inordinate delay in paying the compensation, which deprived the appellants of their constitutional right under Article 300-A.
* The court noted that if the land acquisition proceedings were quashed due to this delay, it would entail huge expenditure to the public exchequer for issuing a fresh notification.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:

* The court allowed the writ petition filed by the appellants and quashed the land acquisition proceedings initiated by the State and KIADB.
* The SLAO was directed to pass a fresh award taking the market value prevailing as on 22nd April 2019 within a period of two months from the date of the judgment.
* The appellants were entitled to all statutory benefits as are available to them in law.
* The rights of parties to challenge the award in reference, if they are aggrieved by it, shall remain open.

<FACTS>
The insurance claim under two policies was repudiated by the respondent company, and the appellant sought to challenge this decision. The policies had been taken out for the father of the appellant, who is now deceased.
Query Nos. 6.1 and 6.2 were asked by the insurance company during the application process, but the father did not provide any information regarding existing policies with other companies.
The appellant claimed that the repudiation was unjustified, as there was no suppression of material facts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the insurance company failed to adequately prove that the insured had fraudulently suppressed information about existing policies while entering into the contracts.
It was contended that the respondents relied on an incomplete and contradictory table of policies, which was not properly authenticated.
The contra proferentum rule was invoked by the appellants, which states that ambiguities in a contract should be interpreted against the party who drafted it.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed that the insurance company did not lead adequate evidence to prove their assertion of existing policies with other companies during the application process.
The submission of unauthenticated documents by the respondents was declined, and they were unable to produce sufficient evidence to support their claim.
The contra proferentum rule applied in this case, as it was observed that there was no suppression of material facts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The impugned order passed by the NCDRC was set aside, and the respondent company was directed to make payment of the insurance claim under both policies to the appellant.
The amount payable was Rs. 7,50,000/- and Rs. 9,60,000/- with interest at the rate of 7% per annum from the date of filing the complaint till actual realisation.
The appeal stood allowed in these terms, and parties were directed to bear their respective costs.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around an arbitral award between DAMEPL and the Delhi government. The arbitral tribunal awarded DAMEPL ₹1,774 crore as compensation for the damages caused to its project due to the delay in the completion of a sewage treatment plant. However, the High Court set aside the award on the grounds that it suffered from the vice of perversity and patent illegality.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the Division Bench of the High Court had applied the correct test in holding that the arbitral award was suffering from perversity and patent illegality. They also contended that there was no valid basis for this Court to interfere with the decision of the Division Bench under Article 136 of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations note that the curative jurisdiction should not be adopted as a matter of ordinary course, and it should not be used to open the floodgates and create a fourth or fifth stage of court intervention in an arbitral award. The exercise of the curative jurisdiction was justified only in exceptional circumstances where there is a grave miscarriage of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the Curative Petitions and set aside the judgment of this Court which had restored a patently illegal award. The parties were restored to the position in which they were on the pronouncement of the judgement of the Division Bench. The execution proceedings before the High Court for enforcing the arbitral award must be discontinued, and the amounts deposited by the petitioner pursuant to the judgment of this Court shall be refunded.

<FACTS>
The case involves appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The High Court's impugned judgment dated July 7, 2023, is set aside, and Commercial Appeal no. 30 of 2023 is restored to the file of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners urged that the arbitral procedure has become inefficient and unfair due to numerous grounds being taken up in petitions under Section 34 and appeals under Section 37. The counsel emphasized the need for brevity in arbitral proceedings to ensure effectiveness, expediency, and cost-effectiveness.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judges observed that the members of the bar have a tendency to take up numerous grounds in petitions under Section 34, which are not covered by Section 34. This has led to wastage of court time and inefficiency in arbitral proceedings. The UNCITRAL model, adopted for dispute resolution, aims to provide an efficient and cost-effective process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court passed the following order:

a. The impugned judgment dated July 7, 2023, is hereby set aside, and Commercial Appeal no. 30 of 2023 is restored to the file of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.

b. The restored appeal shall be placed before the roster Bench on July 29, 2024, at 10:30 a.m.

c. The Registry of this Court shall forward a copy of this judgment to the Prothonotary and Senior Master of the High Court of Bombay.

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court affirmed the order passed by the executing court despite the appellants' request for an opportunity to hear their objections. The supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution could have been used to remand the matter back to the executing court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed, and the order passed by the High Court was set aside. The executing court's order was also set aside. It was clarified that it would be open for the respondents (decree-holders) to file a fresh application if there is any interference in their possession of the property by the appellants (judgment-debtors).

The case involves a dispute over specific performance of an agreement to sell a property. The petitioner purchased the property from defendants 6 and 8, but the sale deed was not registered in his favor due to defects in the review petition filed by him. The High Court allowed specific performance only to the extent of 90% of the amount paid by the petitioner.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the doctrine of lis pendens applies from the date of institution of the review petition, and any transfer made during this period is subject to the final result of the litigation. The High Court's reliance on Section 12 of the Specific Relief Act was criticized as it did not consider the petitioner's breach of an essential condition of the contract.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's judgment and restored its earlier order dismissing the review petitions. The court held that the errors apparent on the face of the record go to the root of the reasoning on both issues of limitation and specific performance. The review petitions were allowed in terms of the earlier judgment.

<FACTS>
The respondent was found guilty of assaulting his colleague, M. Devnath, during an incident. The Commandant imposed punishment of compulsory retirement on the respondent and preserved his right for pension and gratuity.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The validity of the enquiry report was challenged by the respondent's counsel, claiming that the enquiry officer and disciplinary authority did not meticulously consider the respondent's defence and the weaknesses in the evidence led against him. However, the Supreme Court found no perversity in the enquiry report and no palpable error in the conduct of the enquiry.
The respondent also attempted to challenge the finding returned in the enquiry by claiming that the punishment awarded was shockingly disproportionate to the proven misconduct. However, the Supreme Court held that a sympathetic view had been taken in the matter and no further latitude need be shown to the respondent who was part of a disciplined force.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the Commandant preserved the respondent's right for pension and gratuity, indicating a sympathetic view had been taken in the matter. The court also noted that the respondent was part of a disciplined force and had been found guilty of assaulting his colleague.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed by the Supreme Court, and the impugned order of the High Court was set aside. The writ petition filed by the respondent (original petitioner) stood dismissed.

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argue that the allegations made by the complainant are false and were done with an intention to harass the accused. They contend that there is no evidence to support the allegations and that the complaint has been filed with a view to settle personal scores.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Court observed that the complaint was lodged after the couple had separated, and the allegations were made with an intention to harass the accused. The Court also noted that the language used in the FIR is similar to the Explanation provided under Section 498A of the IPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. The proceedings arising from FIR No. 95 of 2021 were quashed, and it was directed that one copy each of the judgment be sent to the Union Law Secretary and Union Home Secretary for placing before the Hon'ble Minister for Law and Justice as well as the Hon'ble Minister for Home.

The case revolves around the liability to pay customs duty and interest on delayed payment under Sections 125, 28, and 28AB of the Customs Act. The importer had imported goods without complying with the conditions of notification subject to which exemption was granted.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellants argued that the liability to pay customs duty has arisen under Section 125(2) and therefore, the calculation, determination, or assessment of such duty cannot be made under Section 28. 
Respondents contended that payment of customs duty has not arisen either under Sections 12 or 28, it has arisen because of Section 125(2). Therefore, a notice under Section 28 is not necessary.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the liability to pay customs duty arises under Section 125(2) and therefore, the assessment and determination of such duty can be made under Section 28. 
The court also noted that once Section 28 applies for determining the duty obligation arising under Section 125(2), the interest on delayed payment of duty arises under Section 28AB.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court held that the liability to pay customs duty has occasioned under Section 125 and therefore, the calculation, determination or assessment of such duty can be made under Section 28. 
The court also held that the interest on delayed payment of duty arises under Section 28AB.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a removal order passed by the Disciplinary Authority on 28.09.1993, against the respondent-employee. The respondent had raised certain charges and representations which were considered in the fresh Removal Order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
There are no explicitly stated arguments from either party. However, it can be inferred that the appellants (Disciplinary Authority) argued that the removal order was valid and justified based on the evidence and process followed.
The respondent-employee's counsel relied on judgments rendered by the learned Single Judge and the Impugned Judgment to contest the charges and punishment awarded.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Division Bench made an observation that it was conscious of the proposition of law but still tried to make a distinction, which we do not find just and proper. It runs contrary to the record.
The respondent-employee's representation has been considered in the fresh Removal Order, albeit not in as many words.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Impugned Judgment is quashed and set aside, and the Removal Order dated 28.09.1993 passed by the Disciplinary Authority is restored. Consequences in law to follow.
However, by way of extraordinary indulgence, keeping in mind the fact that the respondent has retired and is aged, payments, if any, already made to him in the interregnum, shall not be recovered by the appellants.
The appeals are disposed of in the above terms. No order as to costs.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the judgment of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dated 2 August 2024. The appellant had objected to a settlement agreement entered into between the respondent and one of its creditors, raising several objections to the agreement on merits. The amount of Rs 158 crore, along with accrued interest, was maintained in a separate escrow account pursuant to an earlier order of the court. The CoC had been constituted at the time of the appeal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant include objections to the settlement agreement on merits. However, the exact details of these objections are not specified in the provided text. It is also mentioned that several litigations are pending in different fora, including the Delaware Court and investigation by various authorities.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include the fact that Regulation 30A provides a complete mechanism for dealing with applications filed under it. The court also noted that the NCLT had not considered the application under Regulation 30A, instead dismissing it on the ground that it was a mere directory provision. However, this decision is distinguishable from the present case as no application was filed through the IRP under Regulation 30A.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeal and sets aside the impugned judgment of the NCLAT dated 2 August 2024. The amount of Rs 158 crore, along with accrued interest, is to be deposited with the CoC. The CoC is directed to maintain this amount in an escrow account until further developments and to abide by the further directions of the NCLT.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal related to the remission of a sentence. The appellant was granted remission under certain conditions, including behaving decently and not breaching any conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are centered around the validity and application of the conditions imposed for remission. The court is asked to consider whether these conditions are reasonable and whether their breach warrants revocation of the remission order.

Specifically, the court is tasked with examining:

* Whether condition no.1 regarding behaving decently is manifestly arbitrary
* The interpretation and application of condition no.2
* Whether the principles of natural justice must be followed before revoking a remission order

The arguments also touch upon the rights of the convict under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, particularly in relation to arbitrary conditions and the restoration of liberty.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the remission of a sentence is a significant right that affects the liberty of a convict. As such, any decision to revoke this right must be made with careful consideration and adherence to the principles of natural justice.

The court also notes that the conditions imposed for remission must be reasonable and not arbitrary. If these conditions are found to be unreasonable or arbitrary, they may violate Article 14 of the Constitution.

Finally, the court observes that registration of a cognizable offense against the convict per se is not a ground for canceling the remission order.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court partially allows the appeal and strikes down the first part of condition no.1 regarding behaving decently as manifestly arbitrary.

The court clarifies condition no.2, stating that registration of a cognizable offense against the convict per se is not a ground for canceling the remission order.

Furthermore, the court rules that the order of remission shall not be revoked on the ground of breaches of conditions without compliance with the principles of natural justice.

The appeal is allowed on these terms.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a batch of appeals against the High Court's judgment dated 15.07.2008, which quashed the acquisition of land by the Haryana State Urban Planning and Development Authority (HSVP) for public purposes.
The acquired land was meant to be used for a housing colony, but the Respondents claimed that their land had similar potentiality and utility as other similarly located lands.
The appeals were allowed, and the impugned judgment was set aside.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's judgment was incorrect and that the acquisition of land by HSVP for public purposes was justified.
The Respondents argued that their land had similar potentiality and utility as other similarly located lands, and they should be entitled to compensation at the same rate.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the High Court's judgment could adversely affect the subject acquisition, leading to significant harm to the public at large.
The court also noted that the State Government is conscious of the principles evolved by this Court in regard to the violation of public trust doctrine and will ensure that the acquired land is utilized in public interest.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned judgment dated 15.07.2008, and directed the HSVP to take possession of the subject-land in accordance with law and commence development works without any delay.
The court also granted liberty to the Respondents to avail their remedy under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, if so advised.
In case an award has already been passed for the land owned by the Respondents, there will be no necessity to pass a fresh award.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was a 38-year-old man from a poor nomadic community in Maharashtra who had an alcoholic father and suffered parental neglect and poverty. He dropped out of school at the age of 10 and was forced to work to support his family, doing odd jobs. The appellant has no criminal antecedents and his behavior in jail has been satisfactory for the past six years.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that the doctrine of "rarest of rare" requires that death sentence should not be imposed only by taking into consideration the grave nature of crime but also if there is no possibility of reformation by a criminal. The defense claimed that the appellant's background and behavior in jail suggest that he can be reformed, and therefore, the death penalty should not be awarded.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the crime committed by the appellant was grave and unpardonable, but it is not appropriate to affirm the death sentence. The court noted that the doctrine of "rarest of rare" requires a careful consideration of the possibility of reformation by a criminal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court partly allowed the appeal and affirmed the order of conviction recorded by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. The sentence of death penalty was converted to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment without remission, and it was made clear that the appellant-accused shall not be entitled to make any representation for remission till he completes 20 years of actual rigorous imprisonment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquisition of land for a residential area and the determination of fair compensation to be paid to the affected landowners. The Reference Court had granted a certain amount as compensation, but it was reduced by the LAC and further reduced by the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court erred in reducing the valuation of the land and affirming the figures granted by the LAC. They contended that the Reference Court's evaluation was nearly accurate and aligned with the evidence of sale deeds and potentiality.
The respondents, on the other hand, defended the reduction made by the High Court, citing the need to balance the interests of the landowners and the State.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court noted that the subject land has not been acquired for profiteering or commercial purposes but primarily for the development of a residential area. It observed that the Reference Court's valuation was in line with the evidence, including sale deeds and potentiality, despite the fact that one of the sale exemplars relied upon by it may not have been ideal.
The Court also considered various factors such as the size disparity between the land covered by the sale exemplar and the acquired land, and the advantageous factors associated with the acquired land at the time of issuance of the Section 4 notification.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned leading judgment dated 23.08.2022 of the High Court, as well as all other judgments following the said leading judgment, and restored the compensation amount granted by the Reference Court.
The Court directed that the compensation amount, if already not paid, wholly or partly, as per the award of the Reference Court, shall be paid to the Appellants and other land-owners along with all statutory benefits including interest, within eight weeks.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal appeal against the acquittal of a public servant who was accused of accepting a bribe. The facts state that the respondent (public servant) had demanded and accepted a bribe in exchange for not forebearing from doing an official act. The prosecution's case relied on the testimony of witnesses, including the complainant, who claimed to have paid the bribe.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* Prosecution: Argued that the evidence established a clear nexus between the demand and acceptance of the bribe and the official act. The prosecution also argued that the amount of the bribe was not trivial, and therefore, the presumption under Section 20 of the Act should be drawn.
* Defense: Argued that there was no concrete evidence to establish the respondent's guilt, and that the testimony of the witnesses was unreliable. The defense also argued that the amount of the bribe was so small as to be considered trivial, and therefore, the presumption under Section 20 should not be drawn.

The High Court had acquitted the respondent on the grounds that there were discrepancies in the evidence of the witnesses and that the amount of the bribe was trivial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court are as follows:

* The court observed that the decision of the High Court was unsustainable, as it did not take into account the fact that there were no discrepancies in the evidence of the witnesses in this case.
* The court also noted that the amount of the bribe was not trivial when considered in proportion to the act sought or performed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Supreme Court is as follows:

* The court held that the prosecution had established a clear nexus between the demand and acceptance of the bribe and the official act, and therefore, the presumption under Section 20 should be drawn.
* The court also rejected the defense's argument that the amount of the bribe was trivial, stating that it was not necessary for substantial amounts to be demanded in order to draw the presumption.
* The court ultimately allowed the appeal against the acquittal and restored the judgment and order passed by the trial Court.

The Supreme Court has directed the respondent to undergo the remaining period of sentence and recover the fine imposed on him.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, a Christian by religion, claims to be still embracing Hinduism only for the purpose of availing reservation in employment. She was baptized and professes Christianity, but seeks to identify herself as a Hindu.
The appellant's baptism certificate is produced as evidence, showing that she has undergone the sacrament of baptism and has been accepted into the Christian faith.
The appellant also attends church regularly and has active participation in Christian worship services.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's claim to be a Hindu for the purpose of availing reservation in employment is untenable as it is made with an ulterior motive, contrary to the principles and tenets of the Indian Constitution.
The extension of benefits of reservation to people with such ulterior motives would defeat the social ethos of the policy of reservation.
The appellant's dual claim of being a Christian by religion but identifying herself as a Hindu for employment purposes is fraudulent on the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
India is a secular country, and every citizen has the right to practise and profess a religion of their choice as guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution.
The purpose of conversion should be genuinely inspired by the principles, tenets, and spiritual thoughts of the new faith, rather than solely for personal benefits such as reservation in employment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal stands dismissed as there is no merit in it. The conferment of Scheduled Caste communal status to the appellant would go against the very object of reservation and would amount to fraud on the Constitution.
There is no order as to costs, and pending application(s), if any, shall stand closed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appeal of an individual against their conviction and sentence in a Sessions Case No.64 of 2013. The individual was accused of being involved in a crime and was convicted by the trial court. The High Court confirmed the conviction, leading to the individual filing an appeal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution presented several circumstances as evidence against the appellant, including:
- Recovery of incriminating articles from the place where the appellant took the police party
- Presence of blood-stains on the appellant's clothes and jewellery recovered from the same location
Motive was also cited by the prosecution as a reason for the crime.
The appellant argued that the prosecution had failed to prove these circumstances beyond reasonable doubt, particularly considering the accessibility of the locations where the articles were recovered.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
- The court noted several discrepancies in the prosecution's evidence:
  •   The recovery of incriminating articles from a flowing body of water, which raises questions about the integrity and reliability of the evidence.
  •   The presence of blood-stains on the appellant's clothes does not necessarily prove involvement in the crime, especially since the appellant was present at the scene and informed the police.
  •   The recovery of jewellery, specifically the mangalsutra, did not undergo proper identification processes to confirm its ownership.
- The court emphasized that motive alone is insufficient as proof of guilt and must be accompanied by concrete evidence that rules out all other possible explanations for the crime.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed the judgments and orders of the High Court and trial court, and directed the release of the appellant if not required in any other case. The court based its decision on the failure of the prosecution to prove the circumstances beyond reasonable doubt, highlighting the importance of concrete evidence over circumstantial evidence.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a dispute between the accused persons and a Bank over a loan transaction. The parties have settled the matter, with the borrowers paying an amount of Rs.3,80,00,000/- under OTS (One Time Settlement). The Bank has also decided to close the loan account after receiving the payment.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argue that since the parties have settled the dispute, the criminal proceedings should be quashed under Section 482 CrPC. They contend that the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak, and continuing the proceedings would put them to great oppression and prejudice.

The High Court had refused to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC, but this decision was overturned by the Supreme Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case highlights the importance of considering the settlement between parties when deciding whether to quash criminal proceedings. The court observes that the dispute involved predominantly civil aspects and that the possibility of conviction is remote.

The High Court's decision not to quash the proceedings was based on the serious nature of the offense under Section 307 IPC, but this decision was ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allows the appeal and quashes the criminal proceedings against the appellants. The court observes that the High Court should have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC to quash the proceedings.

The judgment states: "We accordingly pass the following order:

(i)   The appeal is allowed.
(ii)    The impugned judgment        and      order     dated      1st

             September 2017 passed by the High Court of

             Judicature at Hyderabad for the State of Telangana

             and the State of Andhra Pradesh in Criminal Petition

             No. 5778 of 2016 is quashed and aside.
(iii)   The criminal proceedings against the appellants in

             C.C. No. 16 of 2014 on the file of Principal Special

             Judge for CBI Cases, Nampally, Hyderabad is also

             quashed and set aside."

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the grant of pre-reference interest in an arbitral award. The appellant had claimed pre-reference interest under claim no. 6, but the High Court modified this claim by rejecting pre-reference interest. The District Judge had upheld the Arbitrator's Award, which included the grant of pre-reference interest.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are based on the interpretation of Section 31(7)(a) of the Act and the principles of procedural law. It is argued that pendente lite interest is a matter of procedural law, while pre-reference interest is governed by substantive law. The parties' contract was also analyzed to determine if it prohibited the grant of pre-reference interest.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case highlight the importance of understanding the distinction between procedural and substantive law in determining the entitlement to pre-reference interest. It is noted that Section 31(7)(a) is a procedural law, but this does not necessarily determine the outcome of the case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment allows the appeal and sets aside the judgment of the High Court with respect to claim no. 6, in so far as it rejected pre-reference interest awarded by the Arbitrator. The Award of claim no. 4 is upheld, and under claim no. 6, the appellant will also be entitled to claim pre-reference interest.

<FINDINGS_OF_FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed under Sections 376, 420, 504, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. The complainant alleged that the accused had committed rape and cheated her by promising to marry her. However, it was discovered that the relationship between the parties was consensual for about nine years before turning sour.
</FINDINGS_OF_FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:

* The complainant alleged that she was deceived into a long-term relationship with false promises of marriage and financial support, which were later reneged upon by the accused.
* The accused denied making any such promises or deceiving the complainant, stating that the relationship was consensual from the start.
* The court observed that the complainant's decision to seek legal action after nine years of a consensual relationship raised questions about her motivations and the nature of their relationship.
* The court also noted the worrying trend of criminalizing long-term relationships upon turning sour, which can lead to abuse of the process of law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The court observed that every case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances, given the dynamic nature of human relationships and psychology.
* The court noted that attaching criminality to a prolonged physical relationship at a belated stage can have serious consequences and lead to abuse of the process of law.
* The court also mentioned that the large number of cases dealing with similar matters as discussed above had revealed a worrying trend of seeking to criminalize consensual relationships upon turning sour by invoking criminal jurisprudence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The court held that no prima facie case had been made out about the commission of an offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC.
* The court also noted that no allegations of cheating had been made against the accused to fall within the scope of Section 420 IPC, nor any of the offences under Sections 504 and 506 of the IPC.
* Consequently, the court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order dated 12.02.2018 passed by the Bombay High Court in Criminal Writ Petition (CRWP) No. 5190 of 2017.
* The FIR being CR No. 302 of 2017 dated 15.08.2017 registered against the accused with the Kharghar Police Station, Navi Mumbai under Sections 376, 420, 504, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code was quashed.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a corporate debtor (2nd respondent) and its corporate guarantor, ACIL (1st respondent). The appellant, who is the resolution applicant in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) of ACIL, paid Rs.38.87 crores to the 1st respondent-financial creditor under the resolution plan. The issue at hand is whether this payment extinguishes the liability of the corporate debtor to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* Appellant's counsel argued that the payment made by the appellant to the 1st respondent-financial creditor under the resolution plan extinguishes the liability of the corporate debtor (2nd respondent) to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction.
* The 1st respondent-financial creditor argued that the payment made by the appellant does not extinguish its right to recover the balance debt payable by the corporate debtor.
* The 2nd respondent-corporate debtor argued that the assets of its subsidiary company cannot form part of the CIRP process of ACIL, and factually, the assets of the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor were not part of the resolution plan approved in the CIRP of ACIL.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The payment made by the appellant to the 1st respondent-financial creditor under the resolution plan only extinguishes the liability of ACIL as a corporate guarantor, but not the liability of the corporate debtor (2nd respondent) to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction.
* The assets of the subsidiary company cannot form part of the CIRP process of its holding company.
* The financial creditor can always file separate applications under Section 7 of the IBC against the corporate debtor and the corporate guarantor, which can be filed simultaneously as well.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The payment made by the appellant to the 1st respondent-financial creditor under the resolution plan does not extinguish the liability of the corporate debtor (2nd respondent) to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction.
* The assets of the subsidiary company cannot be included in the resolution plan of its holding company.
* The financial creditor can file separate applications under Section 7 of the IBC against the corporate debtor and the corporate guarantor, which can be filed simultaneously as well.
The appeal was dismissed with no order as to costs.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the entitlement of pension to members of the Roadways Karamchari Sanyukta Parishad (RKSP) who were promoted on a pensionable post after the cutoff date of 27.08.1982.
The Allahabad High Court had ruled in favor of the RKSP, but the UPSRTC appealed against this decision.
The RKSP members had been granted pension by the government under various notifications and orders.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties are as follows:

* The RKSP argued that they were entitled to pension as per the government's notifications and orders, and their service conditions in the Corporation did not provide for any inferior service conditions.
* The UPSRTC contended that only State Government employees absorbed in the Corporation shall be entitled to pension, and the phrase "their service conditions shall not be inferior to the conditions as were available under the Government" would be applicable only to State Government employees.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:

* The Division Bench of the High Court was incorrect in holding that the members of the RKSP are entitled to pension even if they have been promoted after the cutoff date of 27.08.1982.
* Employees who were promoted in the UPSRTC on a pensionable post between 1972 to 1981 are getting pension, but those promoted after the cutoff date are not entitled to pension.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:

* The court set aside the order passed by the Division Bench and the learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court under the impugned judgment(s).
* The appeals filed by UPSRTC being C.A. No. 895 of 2020, C.A. No. 896 of 2020, C.A. No. 897 of 2020, C.A. No. 898 of 2020 and C.A. No. (s) ________ of 2024 @ SLP (c) __________of 2024 @ Diary No. 10240 of 2020 are allowed.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the bail application of an individual (referred to as "the appellant") accused of committing offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA). The charge sheet and statement of witness Z were considered for evaluating the prima facie truth of the accusations. The Special Court and High Court initially rejected the bail application.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defence argued that there was no reasonable ground to believe that the appellant was involved in any UAPA offences, as there was insufficient evidence in the charge sheet to support this claim. The defence also pointed out that no antecedents of the appellant were provided, which further weakened the prosecution's case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Courts did not consider the material in the charge sheet objectively, with a focus on the activities of the Popular Front of India (PFI) instead of the individual case. This led to an improper appreciation of the appellant's situation.
The current bail application process was seen as a deviation from the principle that "bail is the rule and jail is an exception." The Courts were reminded of their duty to grant bail in accordance with the law, considering that the allegations made by the prosecution may be serious but do not necessarily warrant denial of bail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned orders and allowed the appeal. The appellant was directed to be enlarged on bail on appropriate terms and conditions as fixed by the Special Court, with the requirement that they must be produced before the court within a maximum of 7 days from the date of the order.

<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the judgment of the High Court of Karnataka at Kalaburagi, which acquitted the respondent-accused in a criminal case related to the dishonour of a cheque.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants (petitioners) included:
* The trial court and the high court erred in acquitting the respondent-accused despite sufficient evidence against them.
* The courts failed to consider the legal presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which states that the drawer of a cheque is presumed to have committed an offence if the cheque is dishonoured.
* The high court's judgment was based on irrelevant grounds and fallacies in the re-appreciation of fundamental evidentiary material.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court include:
* There is no perversity and lack of evidence in the case of the respondent-accused.
* The concurrent findings have backing of a detailed appraisal of evidences and facts, therefore, do not warrant interference.
* Similar cases involving criminal liability arising out of dishonour of cheque have been dejected from reversing concurrent findings of acquittal of accused by this Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the Supreme Court is as follows:
* The instant appeal is dismissed and the findings of the High Court in the impugned judgment dated 03.03.2023 are affirmed.
* Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a challenge to the quantified disability requirement for admission to educational institutions. The appellant was denied admission due to their benchmark disability, and they filed an appeal against the impugned order.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the appellant's lawyers argued that quantified disability per se should not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission. They may have also argued that the Disability Assessment Boards' decisions should be subject to judicial review and that the candidates should be given an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities despite their disabilities.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court noted that many individuals in India, including notable figures such as Sudha Chandran, Arunima Sinha, H. Boniface Prabhu, Srikanth Bolla, and Dr. Satendra Singh, have achieved great heights despite their disabilities. The court also observed that famous historical figures like Homer, Milton, Mozart, Beethoven, and Byron were not allowed to realize their full potential due to similar circumstances.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission to educational institutions. The Disability Assessment Boards' decisions should positively record whether the disability of the candidate will or will not come in the way of pursuing the course in question. The Disability Assessment Boards should state reasons in case they conclude that the candidate is not eligible for pursuing the course.

The court directed the concerned authorities to treat the admission granted to the appellant as a valid admission in the eye of law. The appeal was allowed, and the impugned order dated 29.08.2024 was set aside. The writ petition pending in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay will stand disposed of in terms of the holding in the present judgment.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between an appellant and respondents regarding the commissioning of a solar power project. The respondents claimed that they were entitled to an extension under Article 2.5 of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) due to unforeseen delays in securing approvals. The appellant disputed this claim, arguing that the delay was attributable to the respondents' lack of diligence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties are as follows:

* Respondents: 
  - Article 2.5 of the PPA grants an extension for unforeseen delays.
  - The respondents acted diligently and with care in securing approvals, which were delayed due to government processes.
  - The large number of similar cases and the government's response show that the delay was not unique to the respondents.
* Appellant: 
  - Article 8.3(b)(iv) of the PPA excludes delays caused by the respondent's lack of diligence from being considered under force majeure.
  - The respondents failed to comply with notice requirements under Article 8.3(b)(i).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The APTEL (Appellate Tribunal) had previously granted a 6-month extension to the respondents after considering their individual facts and circumstances.
- The government's direction to DISCOMs to set up committees to consider each request for extension shows that the respondents' claims were not entirely without basis.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- No substantial question of law arises in this case, as the APTEL's findings on attributability of delay and applicability of force majeure are neither illegal nor unreasonable.
- The APTEL was correct in holding that the respondents acted diligently and with care to secure approvals, which were delayed due to government processes.
- The direction to pay late payment surcharge to the respondents is justified, as it is explicitly rooted in the PPA and intended by the parties.

The court dismissed the appeals brought by the appellant.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The incident occurred due to a matrimonial dispute between Hussainbhai's sister and her husband Abbasbhai. The tension was building up since morning as Abbasbhai insisted that his wife Oneja should come to his house and then demanded the cupboard key of their Ahmedabad house. The incident took place inside the residence of Hussainbhai's father Asgarali, not in the residence of Idrishbhai.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that Hussainbhai acted with culpable homicide, intending to cause death or knowing that his actions could lead to death. The defense argued that the incident was a result of a sudden fight and that Hussainbhai was overcome by emotion due to the tense situation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the entire incident occurred in the heat of the moment, and neither party could control their anger, resulting in the fateful incident. The High Court had brought down the charge from Section 304 Part I IPC to Section 304 II IPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld the conviction under Section 304 Part II IPC but modified the sentence of Hussainbhai Asgarali Lokhandwala to the period already undergone by him. The court directed that he be released forthwith if his detention is not required in any other case.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the inheritance of a tenancy by Smt. Usha Mitra and her family members from Sh. S.K. Mitra, who died in 1970. The appellants claimed that their tenancy rights were protected under the old statute and were not affected by the introduction of the 1997 Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Division Bench argued that the legislature can restrict heritability by amending or repealing the law, and in this case, it had done so in the 1997 Act. The Division Bench held that since the legislature can restrict heritability, it has done precisely that in the 1997 Act.
On the other hand, the appellants argued that statutory laws operate prospectively, and if the legislature intends to make a law retrospective, such an intention must be shown clearly and unambiguously in the statute itself. The appellants contended that there was no clear and unequivocal intention in the 1997 Act to have a retrospective operation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Division Bench's mere interpretation of a statutory provision cannot make the law retrospective and take away the heritable rights of a tenant. The court also noted that the exclusion of a spouse from inheriting the tenancy was discriminatory and deprived the surviving spouse of a valuable entitlement granted to other heirs.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that Smt. Usha Mitra and the appellants jointly inherited the tenancy from Sh. S.K. Mitra in 1970, and their tenancy did not expire in 2006 with the introduction of the 1997 Act. The court also set aside the orders dated 29.06.2022 and 08.12.2022 of the Single Judge and the Division Bench respectively.

The case involves a dispute over property rights between multiple parties, including Sami Ullah and Badlu (respondents Nos. 4 and 5), Zahoor Ahmad, and others. The dispute revolves around the extent of their respective shares in the land comprised in khata Nos. 98 and 99, excluding plot Nos. 35, 37, 111, and 112.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court held that the lease deed dated 07.05.1922 is valid and that Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad acquired the property as lessees, not as joint family property. The court also noted that the concept of joint family property is prevalent amongst Hindus, but not amongst Muslims.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's decision was based on a factual determination of the evidence on record. The court observed that the authorities below misdirected themselves by considering the acquisition of the property as joint acquisition for the family. The High Court also noted that the Deputy Director of Consolidation was not justified in importing principles of Hindu law while determining the shares of the parties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court held that the petitioners of writ petition No. 6635 of 1974 will get 1/12 share jointly in the plots comprised in khata Nos. 98 and 99, excluding plot Nos. 35, 37, 111, and 112 which exclusively belong to Sami Ullah and his brother Badlu, sons of Abdul Ghafoor.

The case involves a foreign national, Pranav, who is seeking Indian citizenship. It is mentioned that Pranav's father was an Indian citizen and had passed away, and his mother is also a citizen of India. However, the exact circumstances of their relationship to India are not clearly stated.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argues that the language used in the provisions of the 1955 Act is plain and simple and should be given its ordinary meaning. They also mention that there is no scope for liberal interpretation or equitable considerations while granting citizenship to foreign nationals.
The court further points out that Pranav can apply for Indian citizenship under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act, provided he has been an ordinary resident of India for twelve months preceding the date of application. Additionally, they mention that there is a power to relax this period vested in the Central Government under sub-section (1A) of Section 5.
The court also references Article 142 of the Constitution of India, which gives them extraordinary jurisdiction to deal with exceptional circumstances. However, they decide not to exercise this power in this case as it does not warrant such action.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the language used in the provisions of the 1955 Act is plain and simple and should be given its ordinary meaning. They also note that there is no scope for liberal interpretation or equitable considerations while granting citizenship to foreign nationals.
The court further notes that Pranav can apply for Indian citizenship under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act, provided he has been an ordinary resident of India for twelve months preceding the date of application. Additionally, they mention that there is a power to relax this period vested in the Central Government under sub-section (1A) of Section 5.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court sets aside the impugned orders and allows the appeal. They dismiss Writ Petition (C) No.123 of 2024 but note that Pranav can still apply for citizenship by invoking clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act or by applying to the Central Government for relaxation of the period of twelve months provided in this clause.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appellants, a group of temporary employees working under the SSD Fund, who were denied pensionary benefits. The appellants claimed that their service conditions had evolved over time and warranted reclassification from temporary to regular status. The administrative orders and Board proceedings consistently treated the appellants as equivalent to regular government employees.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' main argument was that their employment bore substantial hallmarks of regular government service, despite being formally classified as temporary employees. They argued that denying them pensionary benefits solely on the basis of their temporary status was an oversimplification of their employment relationship with the government.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations in this case highlight the importance of considering the actual course of employment and service conditions, rather than relying solely on initial classification. The court noted that the denial of pensionary benefits to the appellants was arbitrary and violated their fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the impugned judgment rendered by the High Court did not stand scrutiny, and it was set aside. The respondents were directed to extend the benefits of the 6th Central Pay Commission, including pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008, to the appellants in the same terms as their peers in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22.

The case revolves around the issue of whether broken period interest can be deducted as a business expense by banks. The facts mentioned in the case include:
- Civil Appeal No.3291 to 3294 of 2009 was filed against the judgment of the High Court.
- The High Court had held that the broken period interest cannot be deducted as a business expense by banks.
- However, the Appellate Tribunal's judgments dated 29th May 2003 and 15th July 2004 were in favor of the banks allowing the deduction for broken period interest.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The Revenue argued that the increase in capital resulting from the purchase of securities leads to an expansion of the bank's capital base, which helps in profit-making. Therefore, the expenditure on the purchase of securities was a capital outlay and not a business expense.
- However, the High Court rejected this contention, stating that the outlay on the purchase of securities was not a capital outlay but rather a necessary business expense.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the court include:
- The court noted that different benches of the Appellate Tribunal had taken differing views on whether broken period interest can be deducted as a business expense.
- However, the majority view of the bench was in favor of allowing the deduction for broken period interest.
</Observations>

<Judgment>
The judgment of the court is:
- The judgments of the Appellate Tribunal dated 29th May 2003 and 15th July 2004 were restored.

The case revolves around a dispute regarding the ownership of certain properties in Kerala, India. The plaintiffs claimed that they were entitled to the properties, while the defendants disputed their claim. The High Court had initially allowed the plaintiffs' suit, but the Full Bench of the Kerala High Court later reversed this decision, holding that the plaintiffs did not have any title or interest in the properties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the majority view of the Full Bench was incorrect and that the minority view was the correct interpretation of the law. They also contended that the findings of fact by the Trial Court and the High Court were perverse and should be interfered with by this Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that none of the scenarios mentioned in the case for interfering with concurrent findings of fact appeared to be met. Therefore, the findings of fact in respect of scheduled properties under item No.2 remained undisturbed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that while keeping in view the factors discussed earlier, any of the situations mentioned or other similar situations have to be met for interference in concurrent findings of fact. In this case, none of these scenarios appeared to be so met, and therefore, the findings of fact remained undisturbed.
The Supreme Court further clarified that the pronouncement of law in this judgment shall apply prospectively, and any transaction concluded or ongoing will not be disturbed by way of this judgment. The position of law as stated herein shall apply only henceforth.

The case involves a brutal murder, and the appellants were convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Ambala, in Sessions Case no.16 of 2013. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh upheld the convictions in Criminal Appeal Nos.D-335-DB and D-398-DB of 2017 (O&M).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that there was no legal evidence to prove the involvement of the accused, and the confessional statements made by them to the police were not admissible as evidence. The defense also pointed out that the prosecution had failed to establish the guilt of the appellants beyond a reasonable doubt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court noted that the offense was gruesome and revolts the human conscience, but an accused can only be convicted on legal evidence. The Court observed that the confessional statements made by the accused were not admissible as evidence except to the extent of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquisition of land for a company, JAL. The acquisition proceedings commenced vide the notification under Section 4 dated 25.07.2008. A Supplementary Award was passed on 02.05.2022 determining the amount of compensation to be paid to the affected parties (Respondent Nos. 1-6). However, before the amount of compensation could be determined, the subject land stood transferred to JAL.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court relied on Section 38 of the 2013 Act and Section 41 of the 1894 Act to argue that payment towards the cost of acquisition should have been made by JAL to the State of Himachal Pradesh prior to the land being transferred. The court also discussed how the acquisition proceedings were not properly followed, leading to a contravention of the relevant sections.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was a failure on the part of the State and JAL to follow the proper procedure for land acquisition. This led to a delay in determining the amount of compensation, causing inconvenience to the affected parties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the Respondent Nos. 7 and 10 (the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Land Acquisition Collector, Arki) to pay the amount of Rs. 3,05,31,095/- to the Respondent Nos. 1-6 for expeditious conclusion of the acquisition proceedings. The court clarified that the State shall recover the said amount from JAL as the liability to pay the cost of acquisition ultimately falls on JAL.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a murder charge against seven accused persons (appellants). The prosecution's case is based on circumstantial evidence, including the testimonies of eyewitnesses. However, the prosecution has failed to provide direct evidence linking the accused persons to the crime. The deceased was found dead under unnatural circumstances, but there is no conclusive proof that the accused persons were involved in the commission of murder.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the circumstantial evidence presented by the eyewitnesses is sufficient to prove the accused persons' guilt. However, the defense counters that the prosecution has failed to meet the test of proof and that the chain of evidence is incomplete. The defense also highlights the presence of a property-related dispute between the accused persons and the eyewitnesses, which could be a motive for implicating each other.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the prosecution's case is full of glaring doubts regarding the offence of abduction. The commission of murder can be ruled out due to lack of direct evidence. The link of causation between the accused persons and the alleged offence is missing, making it difficult to infer guilt from circumstantial evidence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court sets aside the findings of conviction arrived at by the Trial Court and the High Court. It also holds that the High Court erred in reversing the acquittal of two accused persons (A-6 and A-7). The court directs the release of all seven accused persons, who are hereby acquitted of all charges. The interim application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a criminal investigation and subsequent proceedings. The accused were acquitted in an NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) case, but a new FIR was registered against them due to alleged forgery of evidence. The High Court intervened and quashed the criminal proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, it can be inferred that the prosecution argued for the continuation of the trial, while the defense may have claimed innocence or sought to challenge the validity of the FIR.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's order quashing the criminal proceedings was deemed unwarranted by the Supreme Court. The alleged forgery of evidence led to a new investigation and subsequent prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.4887 of 2024, setting aside the impugned order of the High Court. It restored the trial in Crime No.215/1994 (C.C No 811 of 2014) on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Nedumangad. The Court also directed the Trial Court to conclude the trial within a period of one year from the date of the order.

The case involves a dispute between the appellants (electricity suppliers) and the first respondent (consumer of electricity). The issue revolves around the demand for minimum guarantee charges by the appellants. The first respondent had failed to consume the monthly minimum units as per their agreement, leading to demands from the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The first respondent's contention that they were not liable to pay the minimum guarantee charges due to a lack of jurisdictional facts.
* The appellants' argument that the orders dated 04th May, 2000 and 14th February, 2001 had already crystallized the liability of the first respondent to pay the minimum guarantee charges.
* The issue of whether the decision in the previous order was binding on the first respondent and precluded them from reagitating the issue in a subsequent suit or proceeding.

The court also considered the fact that the appellants had accepted the order dated 16th July, 2009 and issued a fresh demand for a reduced amount.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There are no explicit observations mentioned in the case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The final judgment of the court is as follows:

* The orders dated 04th May, 2000 and 14th February, 2001 had judicially crystallized the liability of the first respondent to pay the minimum guarantee charges and such orders having attained finality bound the first respondent.
* The first respondent was estopped from agitating the same issue of demand vide its second writ petition.
* The impugned judgment and order of the High Court allowing the intra-court appeal being unsustainable in law has to be set aside with the result that the civil appeal stands allowed.

The parties are left to bear their own costs.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over share certificates, with the appellants (petitioners) claiming that they had purchased shares from respondent No. 2 and produced original share certificates as evidence.
The Acting President of the NCLT and the NCLAT failed to consider the documentary evidence and arguments presented by the appellants.
The interim order passed on 27.06.2019 by the Member (Judicial) of the NCLT highlighted the issues that arose for consideration, but the Acting President of the NCLT ignored it and dismissed the petition without considering the material already placed on record.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they had purchased shares from respondent No. 2 and produced original share certificates as evidence to support their claim.
They relied on Section 46 of the Act of 2013, which states that the signatures of two directors on a share certificate are sufficient in law.
The Acting President of the NCLT and the NCLAT failed to consider these arguments and documentary evidence presented by the appellants.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Neither the Acting President of the NCLT nor the NCLAT examined the issues raised before them with seriousness or cogency.
They ignored the interim order passed on 27.06.2019, which highlighted the need for an inquiry to determine the disputes raised by the respondents.
The production of original share certificates and the payment of ₹14,66,39,400/- to respondent No. 2 were not considered by either the NCLT or the NCLAT.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgments in Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018 and Company Appeal (AT) (CH) No. 44 of 2021 & I.A. No. 548 of 2021.
Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018 was restored to the file of the National Company Law Tribunal, Amaravati Bench, for consideration afresh on merits and in accordance with law.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioner has invoked arbitration under an arbitration agreement. The respondents have raised objections against the present petition, but none of them question or deny the existence of the arbitration agreement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court observed that at the referral stage, the referral court should leave it for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether a non-signatory is bound by the arbitration agreement. The respondents' objections against the present petition do not raise any issue with the existence of the arbitration agreement. The court also noted that once the arbitral tribunal is constituted, the respondents can raise all available objections in law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The complexity involved in determining whether a non-signatory is a party to an arbitration agreement suggests that it would be more appropriate for the Arbitral Tribunal to take a call on this question. The court relied on the decision in Cox and Kings (supra) to guide its interpretation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The present petition is allowed. Shri Justice Mohit S. Shah, former Chief Justice of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, is appointed as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator and other modalities will be fixed in consultation with the parties. All rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.

The accused has good conduct during this period.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the appellant argued that due to sudden provocation, the accused came to the house of the deceased and on exhortation by other accused, the appellant shot the deceased and that there was no premeditation in the commission of crime. The appellant was acquitted of the charge under section 25/27 of the Arms Act, arising out of the same crime; and that he was convicted only for the offence under section 302 r/w 34 IPC, whereas the co-accused were acquitted of the said charge.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the object of punishment is not only to deter the accused from committing any further crime, but also to reform and retribute; and the extent of reformation can be derived only by the conduct of the accused exhibited during his days of retribution. The court noted that the appellant belonged to poor economic background and had been taking care of his entire family.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court modified the sentence awarded by the Courts below to the period already undergone by the appellant.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the rate of interest claimed by an appellant. The Single Judge had passed a judgment on 01.04.2010, which was challenged by the appellant in the High Court. The High Court passed two judgments (First and Second Impugned Orders) that were appealed to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented are not explicitly mentioned in the provided case information. However, it can be inferred that the appellant's main argument was against the rate of interest imposed by the Single Judge and later upheld by the High Court in its First and Second Impugned Orders.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of provisions in a law related to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and their applicability. The issue arises from judgments passed by lower courts and subsequent orders that have created uncertainty about the applicable precedents on the subject. The case is referred to as an appeal under Article 136.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in this case revolves around the interpretation of provisions in the law related to MSMEs. The court discusses the distinction between decision-making and precedent-making, highlighting that not every judgment or order made by the Supreme Court is intended to be a binding precedent under Article 141. The court also notes that it takes care to indicate instances where its decisions are not to be treated as precedents.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations from this case include:
* The importance of distinguishing between decision-making and precedent-making in the context of Supreme Court judgments.
* The need for clarity and certainty about applicable precedents on a subject matter.
* The court's role in performing twin functions of decision-making and precedent-making.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the appeal should be referred to a three-judge Bench due to the compelling need to ensure clarity and certainty about the applicable precedents on the subject. The Registry is directed to place the appeal paperbooks along with the detailed judgment before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction and sentencing of seven accused persons (appellants) for various charges, including murder and abduction. The facts surrounding the offense are related to the death of a deceased person, with the prosecution relying on circumstantial evidence. The accused persons and eyewitnesses belong to the same family, and there is a property-related dispute between them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's case relies heavily on circumstantial evidence, which has been thoroughly scrutinized by the court. The prosecution argues that the accused persons are guilty of murder based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and other facts surrounding the offense. However, the defense argues that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt due to numerous doubts and inconsistencies in the evidence.

The court observes that while the post-mortem report suggests an unnatural death, there is no direct evidence linking the accused persons to the crime. The prosecution's case relies on circumstantial evidence, which must meet the test of proof to establish guilt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes several glaring doubts in the prosecution's case regarding abduction and observes that the offense of murder is entirely dependent on circumstantial evidence. However, there is no direct evidence linking the accused persons to the commission of murder.

The court also notes that motive alone cannot prove guilt, especially when both parties can benefit from implicating each other due to their family ties and property-related dispute.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Based on its analysis, the court concludes that the prosecution has failed to discharge its burden to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The court sets aside the findings of conviction arrived at by the Trial Court and the High Court and acquits all seven accused persons (appellants) of all charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves A-1, A-2, and A-3 who are accused of offenses under sections 148, 302, and 307, IPC read with section 34 thereof. The prosecution's case is that the three accused persons committed the crimes at a specific location. However, it is not clear what exactly transpired at the crime scene.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (A-1, A-2, and A-3) argued that there was no testimony of any independent witness despite the place of crime being surrounded by shops and residential houses. They also contended that the oral evidence of P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5 is unreliable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the examination of an independent witness is not an indispensable requirement for a prosecution case to be considered reliable. The court cited several precedents (Guru Dutt Pathak vs. State of U.P., Manjit Singh vs. State of Punjab, Surinder Kumar vs. State of Punjab, Rizwan Khan vs. State of Chhattisgarh) that support this view.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court found A-1, A-2, and A-3 guilty of offenses under sections 148, 302, and 307, IPC read with section 34 thereof. The High Court's decision was affirmed as correct and upheld by the Supreme Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a government official, respondent, who was promoted to the post of Joint Secretary from Under Secretary. The respondent claimed that he should have been promoted on 29th July, 1997, instead of 5th March, 2003. The appellant-Board rejected this claim citing administrative exigencies and lack of vacant posts during the period in question.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given case. However, it can be inferred that the respondent's argument is based on the completion of his "Kal Awadhi" (a period specified for promotion) and his entitlement to promotion from 29th July, 1997.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Resolution dated 26th December, 1991, which fixes the Kal Awadhi, is only directory in nature and cannot be treated as statutory. The court also noted that there was no vacant post of Joint Secretary during the period between 29th July, 1997 to 5th March, 2003.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Division Bench of the High Court's order dated 20th October 2011 is set aside, and the order dated 3rd October, 2007 passed by the learned Single Judge is restored. The court ruled that merely completing the Kal Awadhi does not necessarily entitle an employee for appointment from the date the post falls vacant.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent was appointed as a police constable in the Uttar Pradesh Police Service. A complaint was filed against him, and he was issued a show cause notice. He denied any wrongdoing, and the disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him. The Disciplinary Authority terminated his services on June 24, 2014. The Appellate Authority upheld this decision on September 23, 2014.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that the appellants failed to prove that he was aware of the FIR registered against him and deliberately withheld this information. He also claimed that the disciplinary proceedings were conducted unfairly and without proper evidence. The High Court upheld this argument and set aside the order terminating his services.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the respondent's actions had serious implications, as he was responsible for maintaining law and order in society and enforcing laws. Given his role, a higher standard of rectitude was expected from him. The Court also noted that the records showed that the respondent was aware of the FIR registered against him and failed to disclose this information.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that there was no justification for the High Court's decision to set aside the order terminating the respondent's services. The appellants had exercised their discretion as employers in a reasonable manner, and the disciplinary proceedings were conducted fairly. The Court quashed and set aside the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court and restored and upheld the orders dated June 24, 2014, and September 23, 2014.
</JUDGMENT>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute regarding the recovery of possession of a suit property. The first respondent, the plaintiff, had filed a civil appeal (Civil Appeal Nos. 3159-3160 of 2019) against the order passed by the High Court. The plaintiff claimed ownership and sought to recover possession of the suit land.
The second respondent, who is also an appellant in the contempt petition, allegedly created third-party rights in the property despite the status quo being maintained as per the court's order on March 27, 2015.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly stated. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the arguments presented by the parties involved were related to the recovery of possession of the suit property and the alleged creation of third-party rights in the property.

Since specific arguments are not mentioned in the provided text, I will leave this section as it is.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The reckoning of the period of limitation from the date of commencement of the right of ownership of the plaintiff over the suit land was deemed correct.
* Concurrent findings can be set aside if perversity is found with the impugned decision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court states that:
* The well-merited decision of the High Court in the impugned judgment invites no interference in exercise of appellate jurisdiction, and the appeals are liable to be dismissed.
* Since the same is executable, there was no need for the court to go into the contentions in the contempt petition.
* The contempt petition was closed as above.

Case Analysis
</FUNCTION>

<FACTS>
The case involves an application for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. filed by the respondent no. 1 in a criminal case (SC No. 61/2014). The application was initially rejected but later allowed by the High Court, which has been reversed by the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argues that the High Court's decision to allow the further investigation was incorrect and that the additional charge sheet dated 02.12.2021 should not be taken on record.

The respondent no. 1's application for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. was initially rejected but later allowed by the High Court. The petitioner argues that this decision was based on a misunderstanding of the law and that it has led to unnecessary delay in the trial.

The petitioner also points out that the respondent no. 1 had previously rehashed the same grounds for further investigation in the form of an application under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. in January 2020, after the initial application was rejected.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case highlights the importance of ensuring speedy and timely justice, particularly in cases where stakeholders have contributed to unnecessary delay.

The Supreme Court notes that frivolous and vexatious proceedings can directly impinge on the rule of law by adding to the pendency and consequential delay in the disposal of other cases.

The court observes that such proceedings should be met with due sanctions in the form of exemplary costs to dissuade parties from resorting to such tactics.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court sets aside the judgment of the High Court dated 30.04.2021 in Criminal RC (MD) No. 533 of 2020.

Consequently, Cr. M.P. No 40/2020 in S.C. No. 61/2014 filed by the respondent no. 1 before the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. would stand dismissed.

The court directs that the additional charge sheet dated 02.12.2021 will not be taken on record.

The appeal is allowed, and the trial should be concluded within eight weeks from today with fresh arguments.

The case revolves around a dispute between Govindammal's heirs and the High Court regarding the distribution of property. The High Court had overturned the concurrent findings of the lower courts, which granted 2/3rd share in the property to Govindammal's heirs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court include:

* Discussion on the principles regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
* The concept that an erroneous finding of fact is a different thing from an error or defect in procedure.
* The requirement for a substantial question of law to be raised for the maintainability of a second appeal.
* The importance of meeting certain conditions (a) Not previously settled by law of land or a binding precedent, b) Material bearing on the decision of case; and c) New point raised for the first time before the High Court is not a question involved in the case unless it goes to the root of the matter.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The discussion on the principles regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
* The warning that no court in India or elsewhere has power to add to or enlarge the grounds specified in Section 584 (corresponding to Section 100 of the present Code).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states:

* That none of the aspects referred to above appear to be met in this case, justifying the High Court's overturning of concurrent findings.
* Govindammal (now her heirs) is indeed entitled to 2/3rd share in the property.
* The appeal succeeds and is accordingly allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside, and the findings of the Court below are restored.

The pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.

<FACTS>
The case involved a compensation claim arising from an accident involving a vehicle owned by M/s. Hindustan Motors and driven by its employee. The tribunal had awarded compensation to the claimant-respondents, jointly or severally, from the owner, dealer, and driver of the vehicle.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the judgment, it appears that the appellant (the owner of the vehicle) argued that they were not liable for the compensation awarded by the tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The overriding consideration for exercising power under Rule 33 of Order 41 CPC is achieving the ends of justice.
- One of the limitations on exercise of this power is that a part of the decree which essentially ought to have been appealed against or objected to by a party and which that party has permitted to achieve finality cannot be reversed to the advantage of such party.
- M/s. Hindustan Motors had allowed the part of the award that operated against them to attain finality by not challenging it through an appeal or cross-objection.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
- The appellant was neither the owner nor in control/command of the vehicle at the time of the accident, and the vehicle was being driven by an employee of M/s. Hindustan Motors.
- Apart from the driver, M/s. Hindustan Motors alone was liable for the compensation awarded.
- However, as the SLP was dismissed qua the claimant-respondents, the court is unable to set aside the award to the extent it enables the claimant-respondents to recover the awarded compensation, jointly or severally, from the owner, dealer, and driver of the vehicle.
- The appellant shall be entitled to recover any amount paid by them for the awarded compensation from M/s. Hindustan Motors along with interest at 6% p.a., with effect from the date of payment till the date of recovery.

The appeal is allowed to this extent.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The first respondent was a member of the district judiciary who served from 11 May 1981 to 31 July 2014. She was appointed as a Judge of the High Court in pursuance of a recommendation made during her tenure as a Judge of the district judiciary.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Union of India argued that the first respondent's pension should be computed on the basis of her salary as a District Judge, rather than her last drawn salary as a Judge of the High Court. This argument was based on the assumption that the addition of years of service under Section 14A would not apply to the first respondent.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that accepting the Union of India's argument would result in plain discrimination between Judges of the High Court based on the source from which they were drawn. The court also noted that a similar principle, as applicable to Judges appointed from the Bar, must be applied for computing the pension of a member of the district judiciary who is appointed to the High Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the first respondent was entitled to the addition of the period during which she served as a Judge of the High Court to be added to the length of her service as a member of the district judiciary. The pensionary payments were to be computed on the basis of her last drawn salary as a Judge of the High Court. The arrears of pension were to be payable to the first respondent on or before 31 March 2024 together with interest at the rate of 6% per annum.

The case involves a dispute over the execution of a sale deed between the plaintiffs (buyers) and defendants (sellers). The agreement to sell was signed on 24.05.1981, and the buyers made an advance payment of Rs.12,000. However, the sale deed was not executed due to disputes between the parties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiffs claimed that they were always ready and willing to execute the sale deed but were misled by the defendants. They sought specific performance of the agreement.
The defendants disputed the claim, stating that the plaintiffs never had the funds available to clear the balance sale consideration and that they were middlemen interested in blocking the property and selling it at a higher price for profit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The conduct of the plaintiffs throughout gave credence to the contention of the defendants. The court observed that 43 years had passed since the date of the agreement, and the value of the property was approximately four crores.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order dismissing the suit. However, it dismissed the suit due to the plaintiffs' lack of readiness and willingness to execute the sale deed. The court directed the appellants (buyers) to compensate the respondents (sellers) by paying Rs.30 lakhs (Rs.24 lakhs for advance money + Rs.6 lakhs as cost of litigation).
The payment was to be made within three months, and proof of such payment was to be filed before the court within four months.

The Khalsa University was established by converting three colleges into departments. The appellants gave a specific undertaking that the Khalsa College would not be touched or adversely affected by the establishment of the Khalsa University. The appellants also stated during the course of hearing that the Khalsa College would not be affiliated with the Khalsa University.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in this case is that the impugned act, which was enacted to repeal the Khalsa University Act 2016 and restore the status quo as it obtained on 29th May 2017, is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The appellants argued that the impugned act is based on a non-existent foundation, as the establishment of the Khalsa University would not shadow or damage the character and pristine glory of the Khalsa College.

The observations made by the court are as follows:
- The foundation for enacting the impugned act was non-existent, as the establishment of the Khalsa University would not affect the Khalsa College.
- The appellants gave a specific undertaking that the Khalsa College would not be touched or adversely affected by the establishment of the Khalsa University.
- The maps placed on record show that it is only the Khalsa College established in 1892 which is a heritage one, and all other buildings have been subsequently constructed having no resemblance with the Khalsa College building.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the impugned judgment and order dated 1st November 2017 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in C.W.P. No. 17150 of 2017 (O&M), allowed Writ Petition being C.W.P. No. 17150 of 2017 (O&M) and struck down the Khalsa University (Repeal) Act, 2017 as being unconstitutional. The consequent direction was issued to restore the status quo as it obtained on 29th May 2017.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellants and the tenants regarding the ownership of agricultural Watan lands. The original Watandar, Balaji Chimnaji More, passed away in February/March 1958. The tenants were in possession of the land since Tillers' Day (01.04.1957). The regrant order was issued on 27.11.1964.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they could proceed against the tenants under Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act after the death of Balaji Chimnaji More. They claimed that the provisions of the Tenancy Act were not applicable to the subject lands.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Bombay High Court held that it was not open to the appellants to proceed against the tenants under Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act after the death of Balaji Chimnaji More. The court also observed that the tenancy was lawfully subsisting on 01.04.1957, and the tenants were entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase of these tenanted agricultural Watan lands under Section 32 of the Tenancy Act in terms of Section 8 of the Abolition Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal stating that there were no grounds made out, either on facts or in law, to interfere with the impugned judgment dated 01.02.2005 passed by the Bombay High Court. The court also observed that pending IAs shall be dismissed, and parties shall bear their own costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves A-1 and A-2, who were accused of committing a crime under the POCSO Act. The prosecution presented evidence against them, but it was marred by inconsistencies and contradictions within their statements and testimonies.
A girl student (who is also a minor) made an accusation against the two teachers, which had serious consequences for their future lives. However, upon reviewing the record, it was found that the circumstances on which the conclusion of guilt was to be drawn were not fully established.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that A-1's actions fell within the purview of 'sexual harassment' under section 11 of the POCSO Act. However, the evidence led by the prosecution left reasonable suspicion as to whether A-1 was actually involved in any criminal act.
A-2 was accused of making a criminal threat punishable under section 506 of I.P.C., but the prosecution was unable to prove this.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the case against A-1 and A-2 had several inadequacies, including contradictions within their statements and testimonies. The prosecution's evidence left reasonable doubt as to whether A-1 was involved in any criminal act.
The court also noted that reputation is earned by a teacher upon rendering service over the years, and an accusation like this would remain as an indelible mark marring his entire future life.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately set aside the conviction of A-1 and A-2, recorded by the Special Court and affirmed by the High Court. The appellants were acquitted and released from custody.
The appeal was allowed, and it was held that there were enough missing links in the case to extend the benefit of doubt to A-1. As regards A-2, his conviction under section 506 of I.P.C. was also liable to be set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a divorce and permanent alimony dispute between two parties, the appellant-wife and respondent-husband. The husband has sought a decree of divorce under Section 13-B(2)(i) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which requires that one party must have been living separately from the other for at least three years before filing for divorce. The wife has objected to the grant of divorce and has demanded permanent alimony.
The husband is a high-income earner with a substantial bank balance, while the wife is also employed but has lower earnings. The husband has two dependents, including his own minor child, while the wife has one dependent child from her previous marriage. 
The parties have disagreed on the amount of permanent alimony to be paid by the husband to the wife.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments advanced by the parties are as follows:
- The husband argued that he is willing to pay only Rs. 50 Lakhs towards permanent alimony, submitting that the wife is employed and has several assets.
- The wife demanded a one-time settlement amount of Rs. 5 to 7 Crores as permanent alimony, which would cover her maintenance expenses and necessary requirements.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court noted that the husband has a legal obligation as well as financial capacity to maintain his wife after dissolution of marriage.
The Court observed that the award of maintenance or permanent alimony should not be penal but should ensure a decent living standard for the appellant-wife.
The parties' current employments, future prospects, standards of living, and their obligations, liabilities, and other expenses were taken into account by the Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
After considering the totality of circumstances, social and financial status of the parties, their current employments as well as future prospects, standards of living, and their obligations, liabilities, and other expenses, the Court fixed a one-time settlement amount of Rs. 2 Crores as permanent alimony to be paid by the respondent-husband to the appellant-wife within four months.
The appeals were allowed, the orders and judgments of the courts below were set aside, any pending cases were disposed of accordingly, and the decree of divorce was granted in exercise of this Court's power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the sale of a one-half undivided share in a suit property. The first plaintiff, Karan Singh, had entered into an agreement to sell with the legal representatives of the first defendant and second to fourth defendants. However, the second plaintiff was not interested in getting specific performance from the sale, and the trial court had passed a decree for the whole land, which was undivided.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that since the second plaintiff was not interested in getting specific performance, the decree should have been restricted to the undivided one-half share in the suit property in favor of only the first plaintiff. The court also noted that under Section 45 of the Transfer of Property Act, the plaintiffs would be deemed to have equal shares, namely, 50 percent.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court partly allowed the appeal and modified the impugned decree as follows:
(a) The legal representative of the first defendant and second to fourth defendants were directed to execute a sale deed in favor of Karan Singh only to the extent of one-half undivided share in the suit property.
(b) The defendants were ordered to join Karan Singh in applying to the State Government/Competent Authority for the grant of permission under clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B of the Zamindari Abolition Act to sell the one-half undivided share in the suit land.
(c) If the defendants or any of them did not sign and file the application within two months, the executing court was authorized to appoint a Court Commissioner to sign and file the application on their behalf.
(d) If the application for grant of permission was rejected, Karan Singh could challenge the order of rejection in accordance with law. In case the application was finally rejected, there would be a decree for refund of the sum of Rs. 7,000/- against the legal representative of the first defendant together with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from the date of filing of the suit till realization.
(e) If the State Government granted permission, the sale deed was to be executed in terms of clause (a) by all the defendants within three months from the date of grant of permission.
(f) The suit stood dismissed as far as the second plaintiff is concerned.
(g) The impugned decree stood modified accordingly.
(h) Even if a sale deed was executed in favor of Karan Singh in respect of the one-half undivided share in the suit property, he would not be entitled to seek possession in the execution of this decree as he would be at liberty to file a suit for general partition.
(i) The appeal was partly allowed with no orders as to cost.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case concerns the determination of stamp duty under a Build, Operate and Transfer (B.O.T.) scheme. The lessee was required to pay a certain percentage of the total cost of the project as stamp duty.
A demand was raised by the State on the whole amount, but it was unjustified as the stamp duty is only payable on the amount spent by the lessee.
The Concession Agreement mentions different amounts for the expenditure incurred by the lessee in constructing roads and bridges.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the demand raised by the State on the whole amount was unjustified, as the stamp duty is only payable on the amount spent by the lessee.
They also pointed out that the Concession Agreement mentions different amounts for the expenditure incurred by the lessee in constructing roads and bridges.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the view taken by the High Court was further fortified by two judgments, which considered any instrument where tolls are given in lieu of the amount spent by the lessee as a "lease" for payment of stamp duty under the Stamp Act.
The court also noted that the amount to be spent by the lessee was not exactly 50% but a different figure mentioned in some places of the Concession Agreement.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court partly allowed the appeals and set aside the demand raised on the whole amount, directing the Collector (Stamps) / Revenue Officer to re-calculate the stamp duty payable only on the amount spent by the lessee.
In case the appellants had deposited the demand raised on the entire project cost, they were entitled to a refund of the excess amount lying with the State.
The court also directed the Collector (Stamps) / Revenue Officer to calculate the said amount in each case individually and communicate it to the appellants within two months from today.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a appeal filed by the present appellant against an order of the High Court dated 15th July 2022 in Criminal O.P. No.20716 of 2020 and Criminal M.P. No. 8763 of 2020.
The FIR in Crime No.21 of 2020 was filed against the present appellant, and a consequential charge-sheet was filed against him.
The High Court had dismissed the petition filed by the present appellant to quash the FIR and the charge-sheet.
The present appellant has appealed against this order of the High Court.
The appeal involves an issue regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC by the High Court, particularly when a charge-sheet has been filed in a case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The present appellant argued that even if a charge-sheet had been filed, the High Court could have still examined whether the offences alleged to have been committed by the present appellant were prima facie made out from the complainant's FIR, charge-sheet, documents, etc. or not.
The present appellant relied on the principles of law that the High Court can exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC even when a discharge application is pending with the trial court.
The present appellant contended that it would be a travesty to hold that proceedings initiated against a person can be interfered with at the stage of FIR but not if it has advanced and the allegations have materialised into a charge-sheet.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that even if the charge-sheet had been filed, the learned Single Judge could have still examined whether the offences alleged to have been committed by the present appellant were prima facie made out from the complainant's FIR, charge-sheet, documents, etc. or not.
The observations of the High Court relied on the principles of law that the provision invoked by the accused before the High Court is Section 482 CrPC and that this Court is hearing an appeal from an order under Section 482 CrPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by the present appellant.
The order of the High Court dated 15th July 2022 in Criminal O.P. No.20716 of 2020 and Criminal M.P. No. 8763 of 2020 was quashed and set aside.
The FIR in Crime No.21 of 2020 and the consequential charge-sheet filed against the present appellant stood quashed and set aside.
Pending application(s), if any, stood disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants filed an application for anticipatory bail which was rejected by the High Court. The appellants had consistently disobeyed the orders of the trial court, failing to appear before it despite summons and warrants being issued against them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The power to grant anticipatory bail is an extraordinary power that should be exercised with caution, considering the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court must ensure that the grant of interim protection or pre-arrest bail does not lead to miscarriage of justice or hamper the investigation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The appellants' consistent disobedience of the trial court's orders and their attempt to delay the proceedings justify the rejection of their application for anticipatory bail. The Court observed that the appellants are not entitled to seek pre-arrest bail, considering their conduct and actions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's order rejecting the application for anticipatory bail was upheld by the Supreme Court. The appeal was dismissed as the appellants' actions were deemed to be an attempt to delay the proceedings and defy lawful orders of the Court.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over pay scales between the State's Education Department officials, including Respondents and their colleagues in the same cadre, and other Government Departments. The 2011 Order was issued to address the discrepancy in pay scales for the posts of SDI/ABSA and DBSA. The private Respondents and their colleagues were redesignated as DBSAs and their pensionary benefits were revised accordingly.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the 2011 Order should be implemented retrospectively from 01.01.2006, while the respondents contended that it should be effective only from 01.12.2008. The Single Judge of the High Court upheld the respondents' contention and set aside the recovery of excess payment made to the Respondents.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that prolonged litigation in pay parity cases often leads to parties enduring significant challenges and hardships over extended periods, rendering them infructuous by the time a decision is reached. The delay in resolving such matters usually makes it difficult for employees to receive their rightful benefits.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal in part, setting aside the Division Bench's judgment and the Single Judge's judgment in part. It approved the 2011 Order in its entirety and directed that the Respondents and their colleagues in the same cadre be entitled to the pay scale as per the 2011 Order, notionally from 01.01.2006 and actually from 01.12.2008. The court also ordered that any payment made to the Respondents more than what they are entitled to with effect from 01.12.2008 shall not be recovered from them.

<FACTS>
The case involves a prosecution against an appellant under Section 306 IPC (Abetment of suicide) and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act. The prosecution's case is based on a suicide note left behind by the deceased before committing suicide. The High Court had rejected the petition filed by the appellants under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the charges against them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:
* The prosecution's case is entirely based on the suicide note, which does not indicate any act or omission on the part of the accused appellant that could make him responsible for abetment as defined under Section 107 IPC.
* The contents of the suicide note show that the deceased was frustrated due to work pressure and apprehensive of various random factors unconnected to his official duties. This cannot be considered sufficient to attribute to the appellant an act or omission constituting the elements of abetment to commit suicide.
* The facts of the case are almost identical to the case of Netai Dutta (supra), where it was held that the necessary ingredients of the offence of abetment to commit suicide were not made out from the chargesheet.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case are as follows:
* The investigating agency itself proposed a closure report in the matter after conducting thorough investigation. This suggests that there is no justifiable ground for permitting the prosecution of the appellant for the offences under Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is as follows:
* The High Court's order rejecting the petition filed by the appellants under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the charges against them is set aside.
* The proceedings sought to be taken against the appellant in the criminal case pending for the offences punishable under Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act are hereby quashed and set aside.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint about the excessive usage of vulgar expletives, swear words, and profanities in a TV show. The FIR was registered under Sections 67 and 67A of the Information Technology Act (IT Act). The complainant alleged that the content was obscene, lascivious, or appealing to prurient interest.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the complaint did not disclose any offence under Section 67 or 67A of the IT Act. They contended that there was no allegation of any 'sexually explicit act or conduct' in the complaint and therefore, Section 67A does not get attracted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's judgment was challenged by the appellants. The court observed that the offence under Section 67 is made out only if the content is obscene, lascivious, or appealing to prurient interest and/or having the effect of tending to deprave and corrupt persons. However, in this case, the allegations did not disclose any such commission of an offence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals against the judgment of the High Court dated 06.03.2023. The FIR registered at Police Station Mukherjee Nagar, Delhi under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act was quashed. The court held that no offence was made out in the complaint, and therefore, the FIR should be quashed.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around a notification issued in 1994 by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, which made 'ghee' a product that could be regulated under the provisions of the Market Committee Act. The appellants, who are producers of ghee, challenged this notification in court. The High Court ultimately upheld the majority decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, and the issue of market fee was also decided.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the appellants included that:
* The process under Section 3 of the Act had not been followed for working the scheme under Section 4 of the Act.
* Market Committees did not provide any facilities in the markets for the purchase and sale of notified products, making it unjust to collect market fees from the producers.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
Key observations made by the court include:
* The notification issued in 1994 was a notification under Section 4 of the Act, not Section 3. Therefore, no prior process was required to be followed as contemplated under Section 3.
* Market Committees did provide facilities for the purchase and sale of notified products, and the producers had availed these facilities. As such, they are liable to pay market fees.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately held that:
* The appellants' challenge to the notification was misconceived as no prior process was required under Section 3 for working the scheme under Section 4.
* The producers of 'ghee' were liable to pay market fees, and they could deposit this fee with the Committee within two years from the date of the judgment in four equal instalments.
* The interim orders passed by the court restraining market committees from collecting market fees prior to the date of the High Court judgment stand vacated.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction of accused A-1, A-2, and A-3. The High Court had reversed the acquittal recorded by the trial Court, convicting the accused under various charges. The accused were on bail.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case relate to the admissibility of disclosure statements and recoveries made by the Investigating Officer (PW-27). It was contended that the disclosure statements did not meet the requirements of Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, and therefore, could not be read as evidence. The prosecution failed to prove that the recovery of weapons from open spaces resulted from the disclosure statements.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Investigating Officer (PW-27) did not provide any description of the conversation that led to the recording of the disclosure statements. This lack of description rendered the disclosure statements inadmissible as evidence. Furthermore, the prosecution failed to procure a serological opinion to establish blood group on the recovered weapons.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the view taken by the trial Court was plausible and justifiable, recording an acquittal of the accused. The High Court's reversal of this judgment was not justified. The appeal against the conviction was allowed, and the accused were acquitted of all charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint under Section 143A of the N.I. Act, where the complainant sought interim compensation. The Trial Court had directed the appellant to deposit Rs.10,00,000/- without considering the issue of prima facie case and other relevant factors.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the exercise of power under sub-section (1) of Section 143A is discretionary and directory, not mandatory. They also pointed out that the word "may" used in the provision cannot be construed as "shall."
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Trial Court had mechanically passed an order of deposit without considering the prima facie case and other relevant factors. The High Court did not apply its mind to the issue either.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the provision under Section 143A is discretionary and directory, not mandatory. It set aside the impugned orders and directed the Trial Court to consider the application for grant of interim compensation afresh. The amount deposited by the appellant will be invested in a fixed deposit till the disposal of the said application.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The landowners filed appeals against the grant of compensation at INR 340 per sq. yd. NOIDA authorities also filed appeals against the grant of compensation. The Miscellaneous Applications were filed by the landowners seeking parity in the award of compensation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court considered the enhancement of compensation under Section 28A of the 1894 Act, which serves as a legislative safeguard against discrimination in the grant of compensation. The court also examined the plea for uniformity in the matter of award of compensation under Article 14 of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the landowners' appeals were allowed in part, and the rate of compensation was enhanced from INR 340 per sq. yd to INR 403 per sq. yd. The court also reduced the compensation granted by the High Court at INR 449 per sq. yd to INR 403 per sq. yd.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the landowners' appeals are allowed in part, and the rate of compensation is enhanced from INR 340 per sq. yd to INR 403 per sq. yd. The High Court's grant of compensation at INR 449 per sq. yd was reduced to INR 403 per sq. yd. The enhanced compensation amount shall be deposited with the Reference Court within a period of eight weeks, and it shall then be disbursed to the claimants at the earliest.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involved an appeal against the order of the High Court dated 26th September, 2011, which had set aside the order of the Trial Court dated 19th October, 2010. The Trial Court's order was based on the inherent power saved by section 151, CPC, to do justice as well as to prevent abuse of the process of court. The case pertained to the admission of a document with insufficient stamp duty.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent's counsel referred to section 58 of the 1957 Act, but it was held that this provision did not apply in this case because the Trial Court had neither held the GPA as duly stamped nor as not requiring a stamp. The Trial Court's order was based on its inherent power under section 151, CPC.
The respondent also relied on sections 33 and 34 of the 1957 Act, but it was observed that these provisions require a judicial determination before an instrument can be admitted in evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was noted by the Court that the revenue would stand to suffer huge losses if courts fail to discharge their duty under sections like 33 of the 1957 Act. The Court emphasized the importance of upholding the sanctity of legal framework governing stamp duty, which is crucial for authenticity and enforceability of instruments.
The Court also observed that allowing an instrument with insufficient stamp duty to pass unchallenged would undermine legislative intent and fiscal interests of the state.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed without any order for costs. The order of the Trial Court dated 19th October, 2010, was restored, and it was expected that the Trial Court would proceed expeditiously in accordance with law to dispose of the civil suit pending before it.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the calculation of stamp duty on the "Articles of Association" of a company. The respondent had paid Rs. 25 lakhs as stamp duty, but the appellants claimed that this amount was incorrect and demanded refund. The respondent sought the High Court's order to uphold its payment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that:
- The "Articles of Association" instrument remains the same despite the increase in share capital.
- The amendment introduced by the Maharashtra Stamp (Amendment) Act, 2015 applies only prospectively and not retrospectively.
- The stamp duty paid before the amendment cannot be taken into account.

The appellants argued that:
- The "increased share capital" has been specifically made chargeable by the Legislation.
- The cap will now be applicable on each individual increase.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The instrument 'Articles of Association' remains the same and the increase was initiated by the respondent after the cap was introduced.
- The amendment does not have retrospective effect, but since the instrument remains the same, the duty already paid on it will have to be considered.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The stamp duty paid before the amendment can be taken into account.
- The respondent's payment of Rs. 25 lakhs is correct and the appellants are directed to refund this amount along with interest @ 6% per annum within 6 weeks from the date of the order.

The interim orders shall stand vacated, and pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of two individuals, A-1 and A-2, for a crime. The prosecution's case is based on the testimony of injured witnesses and the Investigation Officer (IO). However, various lapses in the investigation and inconsistencies in the testimonies of private persons were noticed by the court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the convictions should stand due to the lack of sufficient evidence. The defense, on the other hand, pointed out several flaws in the investigation, including:
* Delay in filing the FIR
* Interpolations on record
* Inconsistencies amongst witness testimonies
* Failure to examine independent witnesses
* Use of a private vehicle for carrying out the investigation without explanation
The defense also mentioned that no government vehicle was available at the police station or that the said private vehicle was hired by them. 
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The injured witnesses and the IO in their testimony together are not inspiring confidence.
* The prosecution case stands shaken beyond a point to which no conviction resting thereupon can be said to be just in the eyes of law.
* Various lapses such as these cumulatively affect the overall sanctity of the prosecution case, making it fall short of the threshold of beyond reasonable doubt.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Election Petition No. 1 of 2021 was filed by the Respondent No. 1 (Election Petitioner) before the High Court.
The Appellant is the candidate whose nomination was accepted, but the Election Petitioner challenged its acceptance on various grounds.
The grounds mentioned in the Election Petition include:
- Corrupt practice under Section 123(6) of the Representation of People Act, 1951
- Improper acceptance of nomination under clause (d)(i) of Section 100(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Election Petitioner argued that:
- The Appellant's nomination was accepted despite being in breach of the provisions of Section 125 and Schedule X of the Representation of the People Act.
- The Appellant's nomination form contained false information regarding his educational qualifications.
- The Appellant's nomination was not properly scrutinized by the Returning Officer, as required under Section 36(2) of the Representation of the People Act.

The High Court, however, observed that:
- The Election Petitioner had failed to make specific averments in the Election Petition regarding how the acceptance of the Appellant's nomination was improper.
- The Election Petitioner had not established any nexus between the alleged corrupt practice and the result of the election.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that:
- The pleadings in the Election Petition were imprecise, vague, and lacking specific details regarding the grounds for challenging the acceptance of the Appellant's nomination.
- The Election Petitioner had failed to establish any material effect on the result of the election due to the alleged improper acceptance of the Appellant's nomination.

The High Court further observed that:
- Order VII, Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code applies to petitions filed under Section 81 and 83 of the Representation of the People Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court dismissed the Election Petition on the grounds that it was not properly pleaded and lacked specific details regarding how the acceptance of the Appellant's nomination was improper.

The High Court further observed that:
- The Election Petitioner had failed to make a case under Section 100(1)(d) of the Representation of the People Act.
- The Election Petition was liable for rejection under Order VII, Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code due to its imprecise and vague pleadings.

The High Court allowed the Appeal filed by the Appellant and dismissed the Election Petition No. 1 of 2021.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a respondent who was dismissed from service after a disciplinary inquiry. The respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court, which allowed the petition and ordered his reinstatement on the ground that the charge-sheet did not have the approval of the competent authority.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that:
* The proposal to initiate disciplinary proceedings had been approved by the Chief Minister, but the charge-sheet did not have the approval of the competent authority.
* The respondent had not pursued the appellate/revisional remedy provided under the 1930 Rules/2016 Rules due to a misconception about the validity of the charge-sheet.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The proposal to initiate disciplinary proceedings, including the draft charge-sheet, was approved by the Chief Minister.
* The respondent's writ petition and subsequent appeals were allowed on a ground that had no basis in law or facts.
* The High Court's judgment and order allowing the writ petition was fundamentally incorrect and patently illegal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The impugned order of the Division Bench and the judgment and order of the Single Judge are set aside, resulting in the respondent's writ petition being dismissed.
* However, considering the fact that the charge-sheet was interdicted by the High Court on the ground of jurisdictional error, the respondent is granted liberty to appeal against the impugned order of dismissal or seek a revision thereof within a period of one month from the date of pronouncement of this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. The borrower had approached the High Court seeking relief against an order passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT). The DRT had directed the sale of the borrower's properties to recover dues from the bank.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the borrower's counsel argued against the order passed by the DRT and sought relief under Article 226 of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the High Courts have been entertaining petitions arising out of the DRT Act and the SARFAESI Act in spite of availability of an effective alternative remedy. The Court noted that this practice has serious adverse impact on the right of banks and other financial institutions to recover their dues.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court, and dismissed the writ petition with costs quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- imposed upon the borrower.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The parties involved are engaged in international trade and have disputes related to the payment of an amount under the arbitral award.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellants argue that the relevant date for determining the conversion rate of foreign awards expressed in a foreign currency is the date when the award becomes enforceable, as per the principle in Forasol (supra).
Respondents, on the other hand, contend that the exchange rate should be used at the time of deposit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that when an award debtor deposits an amount before the court during the pendency of objections and the award holder is permitted to withdraw the same, even if against the requirement of security, this deposited amount must be converted as on the date of the deposit.
Additionally, after the conversion of the deposited amount, it must be adjusted against the remaining amount of principal and interest pending under the arbitral award. This remaining amount must be converted on the date when the arbitral award becomes enforceable, i.e., when the objections against it are finally decided.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court partly allows the appeal, setting aside the findings of the High Court to the extent that Forasol (supra) does not apply under the 1996 Act and that the exchange rate on 01.07.2014 must be used for converting the entire arbitral award and interest.
The court directs the Executing Court to determine the amount payable by taking into account the exchange rate as on 01.07.2014, which is the date when the objections proceedings attained finality.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a contempt petition against the State of Chhattisgarh and its authorities for proceeding with recovery proceedings despite a judgment of the Supreme Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) being brought to their notice. The Petitioner's company had been served with demand notices by the respondents, prompting the contempt petition.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented on behalf of the Petitioner were as follows:

* The judgment of the Supreme Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) was clear and unambiguous, specifying that claims raised after public notice would not be considered by the CoC.
* The respondents/authorities had failed to raise their claim before the CoC, despite being given an opportunity to do so through a public notice.
* The continuation of recovery proceedings by the respondents/authorities after the judgment was brought to their notice was contemptuous in nature.

The arguments presented on behalf of the respondents were as follows:

* They claimed that they had not been parties to the Writ Petition or the proceedings before the learned NCLT.
* They also argued that, even if a stakeholder is not a party to the proceedings before the NCLT and does not raise their claim before the Interim Resolution Professional/Resolution Professional, the Resolution Plan as approved by the NCLT would still be binding on them.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made in the judgment include:

* The judgment of the Supreme Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) was specifically brought to the notice of the respondents/authorities, but they continued with the recovery proceedings.
* The case was one of the first arising out of the judgment in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra), and the Court did not propose to take any stern action against the respondents/contemnors.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

* The demand notices issued by the contemnors on the Petitioner Company and all proceedings pursuant thereto were illegal and quashed and set aside.
* Although the act of the alleged contemnors was contemptuous in nature, the Court did not propose to take any action against them. Instead, they accepted the unconditional apology of the contemnors.

Judgment was delivered by a Bench consisting of Justices B.R. Gavai and Augustine George Masih on March 27, 2025.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the findings of the Trial Court and the High Court in a murder case. The appellant, who is accused of murdering the deceased, had been granted bail on April 2, 2012.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the evidence presented showed that the appellant had deliberately killed the deceased using a gun. They pointed out that the number of gunshots fired and the part of the body where the shots were fired indicated premeditation.
On the other hand, the defense argued that the case was one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). They contended that the appellant had acted in a fit of rage due to provocation from the deceased and therefore should be convicted of a lesser offense.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the nature of the weapon used, the number of gunshots fired, and the part of the body where the shots were fired all pointed towards premeditation on the part of the appellant. The court also noted that the defense had failed to establish any provocation or mitigating circumstances that would reduce the offense to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
The court further observed that the case did not fit into any of the exceptions under Section 300 of the IPC and therefore, the accused was guilty of murder.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the findings of the Trial Court and the High Court and dismissed the appeal. The interim order granting bail to the appellant was also vacated, and the appellant was directed to surrender before the trial court within four weeks from the date of the judgment.
A copy of the judgment was to be sent to the Trial Court to ensure that the appellant surrenders and undergoes the remaining part of his sentence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a bail granted to the appellant, and the conditions imposed on them. The appellant was granted bail based on two grounds: (1) that they were implicated based on statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act, which are inadmissible as per the decision in Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu, and (2) relying on paragraph 15 of the decision in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the counsel for the appellant were based on the fact that the bail was granted on merits and there was no reason to impose all the conditions mentioned in paragraph 15 of the decision in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee. The counsel also argued that the condition of obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission and dropping a pin of Google Maps were onerous and not necessary.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the bail was granted based on merits, and there was no need to impose all the conditions mentioned in paragraph 15. The court also noted that the condition of obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission is beyond the control of the accused and cannot be complied with. The court suggested that instead of this condition, the condition of surrendering the passport and regularly reporting to the local police station/Trial Court can be imposed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the two conditions in the order granting bail to the appellant, namely, obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission and dropping a pin of Google Maps, shall stand deleted. The case was listed on 15 July 2024 for passing final orders after considering the compliances made by the appellant so far.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around Mysore Sales and its auction of vending rights to liquor vendors. The Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS) issued orders under Section 206C of the Income Tax Act, which were challenged by Mysore Sales through writ petitions in the High Court of Karnataka.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:
* Whether Section 206C of the Income Tax Act applies to Mysore Sales
* Whether the liquor vendors who bought vending rights from Mysore Sales can be termed as "buyers" within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C of the Income Tax Act
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* There is no express provision in sub-section (6) or any other provision of Section 206C regarding issuance of notice and affording hearing to such a person before passing an order thereunder
* The principles of natural justice require that the assessing officer put the person concerned on notice and afford him an adequate and reasonable opportunity of hearing, including a personal hearing
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held:
* That Section 206C of the Income Tax Act is not applicable in respect of Mysore Sales
* That the liquor vendors (contractors) who bought vending rights from the appellant on auction cannot be termed as "buyers" within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C of the Income Tax Act
* That the High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petitions and consequently, the writ appeal challenging the orders dated 17.01.2001
The court set aside the judgments and orders passed by the Division Bench and Single Judge of the High Court of Karnataka, and quashed the orders dated 17.01.2001 passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS) under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act.

<FUNCTI>
Case Number: Not mentioned
Court: High Court for the State of Telangana at Hyderabad
Date of Judgment: February 10, 2025
Judges: SANJAY KAROL and SANDEEP MEHTA
</FUNCTI>

<FACTS>
The appellant was charged under Sections 269, 270, and 504, IPC for reprimanding a subordinate in the workplace. The reprimand was part of an effort to restore discipline in the institution during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Complaints of indiscipline were already pending against the complainant. The appellant received numerous complaints from parents of students about negligence by the complainant in her duties.
The appellant called the subordinate to chambers and reprimanded her for shirking her duties, displaying a lackadaisical approach towards her profession.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellant's act of reprimanding the complainant was an intentional insult intended to provoke her into committing a breach of peace or another offense.
The defense argued that the appellant's action was a reasonable exercise of his authority as the director of the institution, aimed at maintaining discipline and correcting the subordinate's behavior.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
If the prosecution's interpretation is accepted, it may lead to a gross misuse of liberty in workplaces.
Allowing criminal charges against the individual for trying to maintain discipline may have disastrous consequences, crippling the disciplinary atmosphere required in the workplace.
The appellant's actions were not an intentional insult with the intent to provoke but rather an effort to control perceived indiscipline among subordinates.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court of Telangana at Hyderabad's impugned judgment dated 3rd May, 2024, is quashed and set aside. The criminal proceedings initiated against the appellant under Sections 269, 270, and 504, IPC are hereby quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the quashing of a complaint case by the High Court. The complainant, M/s TRL Krosaki Refractories Limited, had filed a complaint against Respondent No. 1 under various sections of the IPC. The High Court had quashed the complaint case on the ground that the complaint was not properly authorized and that the person who signed the complaint did not have personal knowledge of the facts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's decision to quash the complaint case was incorrect. They contended that the sole proprietor of the company had duly authorized the manager, Sh. Neeraj Kumar, to act on behalf of the company in view of his personal knowledge of the facts. The appellants also relied on a previous judgment of this Court (TRL Krosaki Refractories Limited vs. State of Gujarat) which had held that what can be treated as an explicit averment cannot be put in a straightjacket but will have to be gathered from the circumstances and manner in which it has been averred.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the High Court's decision was perfunctory and erroneous. It noted that the documents submitted by the appellants made it clear that Sh. Neeraj Kumar possessed personal knowledge of the facts and was duly authorized to initiate criminal proceedings against Respondent No. 1.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal, quashed the final judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, and restored the Complaint No. 701 of 2021 to the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khurja, Bulandshahar, for hearing and decision on its own merits.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court, which set aside an arbitral award dated 03.06.2005 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal.
The Arbitral Tribunal had interpreted Clause 51 in a reasonable manner based on the evidence on record, and this interpretation was affirmed by the learned Single Judge exercising jurisdiction under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.
The Division Bench of the High Court set aside the arbitral award, citing that it was opposed to the public policy of India, contained patent illegality, and shocked the conscience of the court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, based on the context and the judgment of the Court, it can be inferred that the following arguments were made:
- The Respondents (appellants) argued that the Division Bench erred in setting aside the arbitral award, as it was a reasonable interpretation of Clause 51.
- The Appellants may have argued that the Arbitral Tribunal's interpretation was correct and that the Division Bench should not have interfered with the award.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that frequent interference with arbitral awards would defeat the purpose of the 1996 Act, which aims to encourage settlement of disputes through arbitration.
The Court emphasized the need for restraint while examining the validity of an arbitral award when such an award has been upheld, wholly or substantially, under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the impugned order cannot be sustained and that the Division Bench's judgment was set aside.
The Court allowed the appeal and restored the arbitral award dated 03.06.2005.
There shall be no order as to cost.

The case revolves around a Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 9162 of 2021, which arises out of an order of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in R/Special Criminal Application No.18906 of 2021. The order denied parole to the petitioner.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judgment states that the socio-economic condition of the accused is a consideration in the case, and therefore, the fine amounts imposed are set aside.
The trial Court had sentenced the appellant to death under Section 302 IPC, to simple imprisonment of 10 (ten) years and a fine of Rs.10,000/- for offence under Section 364 and to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/- for offence under Section 6 of the POCSO Act.
The High Court had confirmed the death sentence and dismissed the appeal of the appellant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment sets aside the sentence of death for the offence under Section 302 and substitutes it with rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 (twenty-five) years without remission.
The sentence imposed for offences under Section 364 IPC (10 years S.I. and Rs. 10,000/- fine) and Section 6 of the POCSO Act (life imprisonment and Rs.10,000/- fine) shall run concurrently with the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 years without remission.
The Special Leave Petition is dismissed; however, the dismissal will not debar the petitioner from availing such remedies as are available under law and in accordance with the judgment rendered hereinabove.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against conviction and sentence for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The appellant was found guilty by both the Trial Court and the High Court. The evidence presented included eyewitness testimony, medical evidence, and recovery of the weapon.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments raised by the Appellant:
- Plea for leniency on account of old age and medical condition
- Request to reduce sentence based on parity with other similar cases
- Request to consider grounds such as health concerns, etc.

Rebuttals by the Court:
- The nature of the offence and its deliberate execution demand an appropriate punitive response.
- Reducing the sentence would risk undermining the seriousness of the crime and the sanctity of life itself.
- The principle of accountability and deterrence must be upheld to prevent recurrence of violent acts disrupting public order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court:
- The appellant actively participated in the attack that resulted in the victim's death.
- The crime was committed with intent to target vital organs, reflecting a level of intent and cruelty.
- The offence occurred in a context of political rivalry, exacerbating its gravity and societal implications.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court upholds the conviction and sentence imposed by the lower Courts. The minimum sentence for murder under Section 302 of IPC is imprisonment for life. The appellant's grounds for reduction of sentence are not deemed compelling, especially considering the severity of the crime and its societal implications. Therefore, the appeal against conviction and request for reduced sentence are dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The ubiquity of corruption in society and its deep roots, which need to be addressed through constant legislative reforms and strict judicial actions.
* The need for good leadership at the helm of affairs to ensure that benefits of liberalization and welfare schemes reach the masses.
* The importance of people rising against bribery and corruption to rid society of this disease.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court denied anticipatory bail to the petitioner. However, it clarified that if the petitioner prays for regular bail, the same shall be considered on its own merits without being influenced by any observations made by the court.

Additionally, the court noted that the principles governing grant of anticipatory bail are distinct and different from those regarding regular bail, and that considerations are different in both cases.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involved the appeal of an accused person convicted under Sections 302, 449, and 309 IPC for brutally murdering four persons, including a child and an aged lady. The accused had been in jail for 18 years and 4 months, and the case was based on circumstantial evidence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Court considered various factors while imposing sentence, including:
* The act committed by the accused was pre-planned/premeditated.
* The accused brutally murdered four persons who were unarmed and defenseless.
* The nature of injuries inflicted highlights the brutality and cold-bloodedness of the act.
* The accused was young when he committed the act (28 years old).
* The act was not for any gain or profit.
* The accused did not try to flee and attempted suicide after committing the crime.
* The accused had a satisfactory conduct report from the jail authorities.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that:
* The accused's young age at the time of the offense could be considered as a mitigating factor.
* The fact that the act was not for any gain or profit and that the accused did not try to flee could also be seen as mitigating factors.
* The satisfactory conduct report from the jail authorities indicated the accused's reformation during his imprisonment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court upheld the judgment of the High Court insofar as the conviction was concerned but modified the sentence under Section 302 IPC from 30 years to 25 years imprisonment without remission, including the period already undergone. The Appeal was partly allowed in the above terms.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant joined the post of Ophthalmic Assistant on 06.03.1985 upon production of satisfactory report of medical examination and police verification roll. However, the police verification report was filed only in the year 2010, i.e., after 25 years of service and just two months prior to the date of his retirement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's termination order is arbitrary, illegal, and in violation of the principles of natural justice. The respondent authorities did not follow the principles of natural justice and did not afford any opportunity to explain his case before terminating him. The police verification report was filed after 25 years of service, which renders the appellant ineligible to receive his pensionary benefits.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The respondent authorities' callous and lackadaisical attitude in submitting the verification report is unacceptable. The Tribunal correctly set aside the order of termination due to non-compliance with the principles of natural justice. However, the High Court erred in allowing the writ petition filed by the State and setting aside the order of the Tribunal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the order of the High Court is set aside. The service benefits which remain unpaid as on date be paid to the appellant within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. There is no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was discharged by the Sessions Court on 20th October 2023. The Sessions Court then passed a further order on the same day, directing the release of the appellant on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.25,000/- and one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Jail Superintendent. The High Court stayed the discharge order ex-parte and directed the police to take the appellant into custody.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the appellant argued that the Sessions Court should not have passed an ex-parte stay on the discharge order. This argument was based on the fact that such a drastic consequence would result from the ex-parte order, making it illegal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The ex-parte order of stay of the discharge order should not have been passed by the High Court. 
- The consequences of such an order are very drastic and alluded to hereinabove. Hence, the ex-parte order of stay is entirely illegal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The impugned orders dated 21st October 2023 and 4th November 2024 are hereby quashed and set aside;
- The High Court will decide the revision application without being influenced by any observations made in this judgment. 
- It will be open for the first respondent-NCT of Delhi, and the fifth respondent to apply before the High Court for giving necessary priority to the disposal of the revision application;
- We direct the appellant to appear before the Sessions Court within four weeks from today and furnish bail effective till disposal of the revision application on such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Sessions Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a conviction of an accused person for the murder and sexual assault of a child. The prosecution presented circumstantial evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. The key facts include:
- The accused made a confession stating that he had committed the crime.
- Physical evidence, including injuries on the victim's body, was found at the scene.
- Eyewitness testimony from neighbors placed the accused near the crime scene around the time of the incident.
- The accused's fingerprints were found on an object near the victim's body.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the circumstantial evidence presented a complete chain of incriminating circumstances, making it impossible for any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused to be true. They relied on the five golden principles (Panchsheel) laid down by the Supreme Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Rajasthan.
The defense was not explicitly mentioned in the case analysis, but the prosecution's arguments suggest that they may have contested the admissibility or reliability of certain evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed several deficiencies in the methodology adopted by both the trial and High Courts in analyzing the circumstantial evidence. These included:
- The lack of depth and rigor in evaluating the evidence.
- Omission to delineate the inferences derivable from witness testimonies.
- Failure to expound upon how the prosecution constructed an unbroken chain of circumstances that irrefutably established the accused's culpability.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately dismissed the appeals, affirming the conviction and sentence of the accused. However, the question of executing the death sentence became otiose as the accused had passed away. The court emphasized the importance of thoroughly evaluating circumstantial evidence in cases where guilt is to be proven.
In a separate note, the court enunciated principles for courts to follow while appreciating and evaluating evidence in cases based on circumstantial evidence:
- Meticulous discussion and analysis of each witness's testimony
- Explicit delineation of reasonable inferences from witness testimonies
- Examination of each link of incriminating circumstantial evidence
- Comprehensive elucidation of the rationale for accepting or rejecting specific pieces of evidence

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the investigation of FIRs (First Information Reports) by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The respondents were employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar, and it was argued that the CBI could not investigate without specific consent from the State under Section 6 of the DSPE Act. The High Court quashed the subject FIRs and further proceedings in pursuance thereof.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants contended that the CBI had power to investigate the offence committed in Delhi, even if it incidentally transcended to the Territory of State of Bihar. They relied on the Resolution No.4-31-61-T dated 01.04.1963 of Ministry of Home Affairs establishing the Central Bureau of Investigation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court rejected the contention that specific consent was necessary for CBI to proceed with the investigation. The respondent-State had granted general consent in terms of Section 6 of the DSPE Act vide notification dated 19.02.1996, and it was not open to the State to argue to the contrary.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals are allowed. The impugned common order dated 13.04.2023 passed by the High Court in WP No.26990 of 2021, and 5441 of 2022 are set aside. Resultantly, CC Nos.13 of 2022 and 15 of 2022 arising respectively from the FIR Nos.10A/2017 and RC22(A)/2017, CBI, HYD, are restored into the files of Court of Special Jude for CBI Cases, Kurnool.

<FACTS>
The couple has been separated for a long time, and the case has been ongoing in the court. The wife (appellant) is seeking a decree of divorce from her husband (respondent). The couple has one daughter who is approaching independence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's argument:
- The marriage has broken down irretrievably due to the respondent's conduct and behavior.
- The couple has been separated for a long time, and there is no chance of reconciliation.
- The respondent has not provided emotional or financial support to the appellant during this period.

The respondent's argument:
- The marriage can still be saved with counseling and efforts from both parties.
- The appellant is seeking a divorce without exhausting all avenues for reconciliation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations of the court:
- The couple has been separated for a long time, indicating that the marriage has indeed broken down irretrievably.
- The respondent's conduct and behavior have contributed significantly to this breakdown.
- Considering the duration of the marriage, the earning capacities of both parties, their age and health, standard of living, and financial contributions, it is justifiable to grant permanent alimony and financial support to the appellant and their daughter.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a young woman who died in an unfortunate incident. An Accidental Death Report was lodged by the deceased's brother, but there is no mention of any involvement of the appellants in the suicidal death of the deceased. The FIR was lodged five days after the incident.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to establish that the appellants had any intention to instigate or aid or abet the deceased to commit suicide. The High Court's reasoning for refusing to discharge the appellants is considered perfunctory by the court. The court argues that there must be a close proximity between the positive act of instigation and the commission of suicide, and a gap of over a month would be sufficient time to dissolve the nexus or proximate link between the two acts.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that there is no allegation about any harassment or cruelty meted out by the appellants to the deceased in the Accidental Death Report. However, it held that the allegations in the FIR could not be overlooked and the Accidental Death Report and the statements made in the Accidental Death enquiry would be a matter of trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeal and quashes and sets aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court. The appellants are discharged from Sessions Case No. 75 of 2015, and their bail bonds, if any, stand cancelled.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCTS>
The case involves the transfer of a prisoner from one prison to another. The High Court had passed an order on August 21, 2023, which was later set aside by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has restored the order dated May 17, 2023, of the Inspector General of Prisons.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the parties involved had different opinions on the transfer of the prisoner and the jurisdiction of the High Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court has observed that the prison administration needs to be reformed for creating a better environment and prison culture to ensure prisoners enjoy their right to a dignified life under Article 21. The court has also noted that there is no clear picture regarding prison administration and facilities available to prisoners in Jharkhand.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court has set aside the order of the High Court dated August 21, 2023, and restored the order/memo dated May 17, 2023, of the Inspector General of Prisons. The court has also directed the authorities to ensure that the respondent's life, basic, and fundamental rights are protected. Furthermore, the State of Jharkhand is required to formulate or expedite the formulation of a Jail Manual incorporating applicable provisions of the 2016 Model Prison Manual for effective prison administration.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a husband and wife who are accused of murdering the wife. The incident occurred in their home, where the mother-in-law poured kerosene on the deceased and set her on fire. The husband-appellant No.1 was present at the time of the incident but allegedly ran away from his house after trying to extinguish the fire.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution relied on Section 34 IPC, which deals with vicarious liability, to implicate the husband in the alleged crime. However, the defense argued that Section 34 cannot be invoked unless there is proof of participation by the accused in the crime and common intention among the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that while the mother-in-law was guilty of the alleged crime, the husband-appellant No.1 could not be held liable under Section 34 IPC because there was no evidence to indicate his participation or involvement in the incident. The court also noted that the prosecution failed to establish common intention among the accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment of conviction passed against the husband-appellant No.1 is set aside, and he is acquitted of all charges. However, the mother-in-law's conviction is upheld. The husband-appellant No.1 is to be released from jail forthwith.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Rule 21(8) of the Punjab VAT Rules and its applicability to input tax credit on iron and steel goods purchased by a respondent at a higher rate of tax. The State lowered the rate of tax with effect from 01.02.2014, but there was no corresponding provision in the parent statute permitting availing of input tax credit at the lower rate of tax on existing stock in trade. The enabling provision in the statute came into force with effect from 01.04.2014.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent had earned input tax credit on purchase of iron and steel goods which it kept as its stock in trade to be used as inputs or raw materials in the manufacture etc. of taxable goods. The State's interpretation that Rule 21(8) applies to existing stock in trade, thereby reducing the quantum of credit, was contested by the respondent. It was argued that prior to 01.04.2014, there was no statutory sanction to allow applicability of Rule 21(8) on the stock in trade i.e. on inputs already purchased for which transactions stood concluded at a higher rate of tax.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the benefit of input tax credit is traceable to the statute, and if the same has to be reduced, it must have the requisite statutory sanction. The statutory sanction came into force with effect from 01.04.2014, making the State's interpretation unsustainable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the judgment of the High Court, holding that prior to 01.04.2014, there was no statutory sanction to allow applicability of Rule 21(8) on the stock in trade i.e. on inputs already purchased for which transactions stood concluded at a higher rate of tax. Consequently, the appeals were dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the invocation of an extended period of limitation and the imposition of penalty under Section 11AC. The appellant, BPCL, had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with its customers for supply of certain products. However, it was alleged that the MOU was suppressed by BPCL, leading to the invocation of the extended period of limitation and imposition of penalty.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in this case are:
- The Revenue department argued that the MOU was suppressed by BPCL, which led to the invocation of the extended period of limitation and imposition of penalty under Section 11AC.
- The appellant, BPCL, argued that there is no evidence of fraud or collusion, and therefore, Section 11AC cannot be applied in this case.
- BPCL also argued that the valuation method adopted by the Commissioner was incorrect, and Rule 4 of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 2000, should have been applied instead.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Tribunal had found that Rule 4 of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 2000, is the correct provision to be applied for valuation. However, this observation was not considered by the lower courts in their decision-making process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal preferred by BPCL and set aside the entire demand on the ground that the extended period of limitation could not be invoked. The court held that there is no evidence of fraud or collusion, and therefore, Section 11AC cannot be applied in this case. Additionally, the court noted that the valuation method adopted by the Commissioner was incorrect, and Rule 4 of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 2000, should have been applied instead.
The Supreme Court has also quashed and set aside the impugned judgments in the remaining appeals and remanded them to the concerned Tribunals for fresh adjudication. The court has made it clear that after remand, the Tribunal will decide the cases in accordance with the law laid down in this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two appeals filed by the petitioners, who are the legal heirs of a deceased person. The appeals pertain to a dispute over immovable property in Gujarat. The disputes arise from an agreement between the petitioners and a third party for the sale of the property. However, due to non-registration of the sale deed, the respondents claimed ownership of the property. The High Court upheld their claims, leading to these appeals.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments were not explicitly stated in the given text. The focus was on the analysis and conclusions drawn from existing legal precedents rather than presenting arguments in the case at hand.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations from the given text include:

- The importance of registration for immovable property transactions, as enshrined in the Registration Act, 1908.

- Compulsory registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act and its impact on transactions affecting immovable property.

- The consequences of non-registration outlined in Section 49 of the Registration Act, which prevents documents from affecting immovable property unless registered.

- The benefits of registration, including public notice, prevention of frauds and forgeries, and verification and certification of title.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's decision was upheld. The appeals were dismissed, with the parties ordered to bear their own costs. The pending application(s), if any, stood disposed of.

Reasoning behind the judgment:

- Citing legal precedents regarding the importance of registration in immovable property transactions and its impact on title and ownership.

- Relying on the Registration Act's provisions that emphasize the role of registration in ensuring orderliness, discipline, public notice, and protection from frauds and forgeries.

- Observing that non-registration does not affect the validity or legal consequences of a transaction but merely affects the rights between parties.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a prosecution against an individual under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The chargesheet was filed, and the trial court issued a summoning order. However, the sanction for prosecution was not granted by the competent authority, and later denied by them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent-State and the complainant argued that the lack of grant of sanction within the relevant time limit would amount to deemed sanction for prosecution. They relied on judgments from Vineet Narain and Subramanian Swamy to support their argument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that Section 197 CrPC does not envisage a concept of "deemed sanction". The judgments relied upon by the respondent-State and the complainant did not deal with Section 197 CrPC, and there was no observation about deemed sanction. The court also noted that the Parliament has not yet statutorily incorporated the proposition mentioned in one of the judgments.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the learned Magistrate was not right in taking cognizance of the offence against the appellant without there being a sanction for prosecution granted by the competent authority. Further, the High Court erred in not considering the fact that the sanction for prosecution was not granted and eventually denied by the competent authority. The necessary sanction not having been granted has vitiated the very initiation of the criminal proceeding against the appellant. Consequently, the chargesheet, the summoning order, and the consequent steps taken by the trial court are liable to be quashed qua the appellant. Therefore, the appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a conviction and sentence against an accused for the murder of his son. The accused's wife and two daughters were also present in the house at the time of the incident, but they were sleeping in another room. The neighbor who was summoned by one of the daughters testified that the accused had initially claimed it was a suicide by self-inflicted injury, which was later found to be false.
The accused admitted to owning the gun used in the murder and provided an explanation for its location, but this was contradicted by the testimony of his wife and daughter. The ballistic expert's opinion on the gunshot wound was not obtained due to a lack of questioning by the defense. Gunshot residue particles were found on the accused's right hand and around the gunshot wound.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The decision relied heavily on prior case law, including Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra (1984), which emphasized the importance of considering all circumstances in a circumstantial evidence case. The prosecution argued that the accused's false claims and explanations were indicative of guilt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that motive is often difficult to determine, as it lies within the perpetrator's mind. In this case, the complete absence of motive was weighed in favor of the accused but not deemed sufficient to acquit him entirely. The prosecution presented a chain of circumstances that led to the hypothesis of guilt rather than innocence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court found no reason to interfere with the conviction and sentence handed down by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court. The appeal was dismissed, and any pending applications were disposed of accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the recruitment process for certain posts, which was conducted in pursuance of an advertisement dated 29th July, 2010. The appellant-employee has laid challenge to the first impugned order and sought quashing of the advertisement and consequential proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant-employee were based on the grounds that the recruitment process was violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, which guarantee equal treatment and fair treatment to each person. The High Court had directed the State to re-conduct the selection process, but the appellant-employee has challenged this order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that the advertisement dated 29th July, 2010 was violative of Articles 14 and 16. The Court noted that the recruitment process must be fair, transparent, impartial, and within the bounds of the Constitution. The Court also emphasized the importance of equal treatment and fair treatment to each person.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the advertisement dated 29th July, 2010 was violative of Articles 14 and 16, and all consequential proceedings conducted in pursuance thereof were quashed. The Court also directed the respondent-State to issue a fresh advertisement compliant with the constitutional mandate and in accordance with the extant Rules. The recruitment process was to be re-conducted in accordance with law for the subject posts.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of two accused-appellants under Section 302 and 304 Part I of IPC for allegedly murdering a person. The prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence, including circumstances such as being last seen, recovery of a meat bag from near the spot, accused-appellants walking on a pathway near Mohan Singh's shop in the night, and accused-appellants inquiring about the deceased in the evening of 2.2.1997.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to test the evidence on record to find out whether the incriminating circumstances were proved beyond reasonable doubt and whether they were of definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused-appellants.
The circumstance of (i) last seen; (ii) recovery of a meat bag from near the spot; (iii) accused-appellants walking on the pathway near Mohan Singh's shop in the night; and (iv) accused-appellants inquiring about the deceased in the evening of 2.2.1997 are not of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused-appellants.
The disclosure statement was not admissible as it did not lead to discovery, and the stone, etc. were allegedly recovered even before the disclosure statement was recorded. Neither Doctor's (PW-1's) statement nor forensic report could connect them with the crime.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court failed to test the evidence on record carefully, relying heavily on the disclosure statement/discovery/recovery without considering the doubts raised by the defense regarding the presence of the witness at the time and place of the alleged recovery.
The site plan of the place from where recovery was made on 6.2.1997 was not prepared until 9.2.1997, raising suspicions about whether papers in connection therewith were prepared at one go as suggested by the defense.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the impugned order is set aside. The accused-appellants are acquitted of the charges for which they have been tried and convicted.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the cancellation of an auction for the disposal of land by the Indore Development Authority (IDA). The respondent No. 1, who was declared the highest bidder, alleged that the IDA acted arbitrarily in cancelling the auction without providing any reason. However, it was found that the decision to cancel the auction was taken to remedy the erroneous minimum rate provided in the NIT dated 07.07.2020, as noted in the report of the Div. Commissioner of the IDA.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:

* The respondent No. 1 argued that the Appellant did not have absolute or unfettered discretion to cancel the auction, citing the case of Eva Agro (supra).
* The Appellants contended that they were well within their rights to cancel the auction as it was undertaken to remedy the erroneous minimum rate provided in the NIT dated 07.07.2020.
* It was also argued that the Division Bench of the High Court effectively usurped the powers of the auctioning authority and fixed the price at Rs. 26,000/- per square meter.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations made by the court include:

* The court noted that the Appellant does not have absolute or unfettered discretion to cancel the auction, but in this case, the decision was taken for valid and cogent reasons.
* The court observed that the Division Bench of the High Court effectively usurped the powers of the auctioning authority by fixing the price at Rs. 26,000/- per square meter.
* The court also noted that the respondent No. 1 did not participate in a second NIT issued after the cancellation of the first one.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states:

* The court held that in the absence of allotment letter and acceptance of highest bid, no relief could have been granted in favour of respondent No.1 as there was no concluded contract in the matter.
* The court noted that the decision taken by the Tender Evaluation Committee to generate more revenues could not be interfered with.
* The court held that the IDA is directed to issue a fresh NIT for disposal of the land in question enabling the IDA to generate more revenues in respect of the land in question.
* The appeal stands allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the respondent against the appellants, alleging defamation through news articles published in newspapers. The auction was conducted on 27.06.2014, and the complaint was filed on 22.08.2014. The appellants are authors of the news articles, and some of them reside outside Bangalore where the complaint was filed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellants are:
- Procedural irregularity in the issuance of summons by the Magistrate.
- Lack of prima facie evidence to establish that the alleged imputations had lowered their reputation in the estimation of others.
- Failure to produce witnesses to support the allegations.
- The complaint was filed after the auction had concluded, and more than a decade has passed since then.

The appellants also relied on a previous order by the same court (M/s.DAG Pvt. Ltd. V. M/s.Bid & Hammer Auctioneers (P) Ltd.) where similar criminal appeals were allowed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
- The right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India is paramount.
- Those working in the media must exercise utmost caution and responsibility before publishing any statements, news, or opinions.
- Accuracy and fairness are essential in media reporting, especially when dealing with matters that can impact individuals' or institutions' integrity.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows all the appeals and quashes:
- The impugned order passed by the High Court
- Summoning orders issued by the Magistrate
- Criminal complaint filed by the respondent, as far as the appellants are concerned.

This decision is based on procedural irregularities, lack of prima facie evidence, and the remote likelihood of securing witnesses. It also takes into account the submissions that there was no intent to defame or harm the complainant's reputation.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction of the appellants for abetment to commit suicide. The deceased had sent a suicide note to his sister, which was later sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for examination. The FSL report confirmed that the handwriting in the suicide note belonged to the deceased.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's case relied heavily on the suicide note and the expert opinion of the FSL report. However, the appellants' defense argued that the suicide note was not genuine and that there was no evidence to prove their involvement in the deceased's decision to commit suicide.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution had failed to examine the Deputy Chief Handwriting Expert of FSL as an expert witness. The court also noted that the accused had not admitted to the genuineness of the report of the handwriting expert.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allowed the appeal, setting aside the conviction and order of the trial court and High Court. The court held that there was no reliable evidence to prove the appellants' involvement in the deceased's decision to commit suicide. Furthermore, the court noted that the expert opinion on handwriting was not sufficient to establish guilt without corroboration.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a contempt of court charge against the appellants for violating an order of the Court regarding the alienation of property. The appellants had given an undertaking to not alienate the property, but despite express orders of the Court, they did so. The High Court punished the appellants for contempt of court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the defense argued against the punishment and sought a reduction or discharge of the order, while the prosecution emphasized the importance of maintaining the dignity and majesty of law through contempt jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court include:
- The powers of contempt of court are exercised sparingly and with caution to maintain the administration of justice.
- The purpose of contempt jurisdiction is to uphold the majesty and dignity of the courts.
- The exercise of contempt jurisdiction cannot be faulted with when there has been an express violation of an order of a Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Court states that:
- The appeal is partly allowed and disposed of with modifications to the impugned order.
- The three months confinement in civil prison shall stand deleted, but the rest of the order regarding attachment of property remains undisturbed.
- The amount of compensation payable by the appellants shall be enhanced from Rs.10 lakhs to Rs.13 lakhs, and shall carry simple interest @6% from the date of the judgment of the lower Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant against his conviction and sentence in a criminal trial. The appellant was accused of certain offenses, but he claimed that he did not receive effective legal aid during the trial.
</Functs>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant's counsel were that the legal aid provided to the appellant was ineffective, as the advocate appointed to espouse his cause did not have sufficient knowledge of criminal laws and procedural laws. The counsel argued that this led to a denial of the appellant's right to a fair trial under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the provision of legal aid is a constitutional right, but it must be effective in order for the accused to have a fair trial. The court noted that the Legal Services Authorities at all levels should monitor the work of legal aid advocates and ensure that they are competent enough to conduct trials efficiently.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgments and orders, and acquitted the appellant of the offenses alleged against him. The bail bonds of the appellant were cancelled. The court also directed that a copy of its judgment be forwarded to all State Legal Services Authorities to enable them to take necessary measures.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an accused appellant who was convicted of charges related to the recovery of incriminating articles, including skeletal remains and currency notes. The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to link the accused to the crime scene.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the accused made a disclosure under Section 27 IEA (Indian Evidence Act) regarding the location of the skeletal remains, but this was not proved as per law. The investigating officer's testimony revealed that the accused did not accompany him and panch witnesses to point out the crime scene.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution failed to establish the factum of discovery/recovery of incriminating skeletal remains through proper evidence. Additionally, the DNA profiling report was found to be inconclusive due to lack of testimony from relevant witnesses regarding the collection of blood samples.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court, while allowing the appeal, held that none of the incriminating circumstances portrayed by the prosecution were established through cogent and clinching evidence. Consequently, the conviction of the accused was set aside, and he was acquitted of all charges. The court ordered his release from custody.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the grant of anticipatory bail to respondents who are accused in a complaint proceeding.

Subsequently, the Special Court passed detailed orders for issuance of non-bailable warrants and initiated proclamation proceedings under Section 82 of the Code.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the respondents was perverse and untenable at law. They contended that the High Court ignored the well-settled legal position and the proceedings conducted by the Special Court against the respondents. The appellants also argued that the respondents kept avoiding the execution of warrants and did not appear before the court, despite being aware of the pendency of the complaint proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
* The High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail was perverse and untenable at law.
* The Special Court had to pass detailed orders for issuance of non-bailable warrants and initiate proclamation proceedings due to the respondents' failure to appear before the court.
* The well-settled legal position was ignored by the High Court in granting anticipatory bail to the respondents.

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that there was no application of mind by the learned Magistrate while issuing the process, making the impugned judgment and order liable to be quashed and set aside. They also pointed out that the High Court misdirected itself in interpreting the provisions under Section 18(a)(vi) r/w Section 27 of the Act.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the penalties imposed by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) on a real estate developer. The appellant had filed insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, seeking to stay the regulatory penalties imposed by the NCDRC for non-compliance with consumer protection laws.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC extends to all proceedings against the corporate debtor, including those related to consumer protection. The appellant also drew an analogy between the moratorium on proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) and proceedings under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the legislative intent behind consumer protection laws is to safeguard the interests of consumers and ensure accountability from service providers. The court also noted that staying regulatory penalties would undermine the purpose of the CPA and embolden errant developers to escape liability through insolvency proceedings.

However, the High Court set aside this order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. The focus is on the analysis and judgment of the case rather than presenting arguments from the parties involved.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court is as follows:
* The appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed.
* The impugned order passed by the High Court is hereby set aside.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of rules regarding category change of properties in Kerala. The respondent had applied for changing the category of their property, which was exempt from payment of fees if the extent was up to 25 cents.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant-State argued that the exemption is only intended for lands up to 25 cents and not for lands exceeding this limit. They relied on the clarification dated 23rd July 2021, which reiterated this position.
The appellant-State also placed reliance on Rule 12 Clause 9 of the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Rules, 2008, which clarifies that when the extent is up to 25 cents no fee is to be remitted, but when the land is above 25 cents up to 1 Acre or less 10% of the fair value, is to be paid as a fee.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The competent authority has found it fit to provide that as on the cut-off date properties, with or without the same survey number, lying as a single unit but covered by different documents can be considered. However, it is again clarified that if the total exceeds 25 cents then the benefit of the exemption cannot be allowed.
The learned Single Judge and Division Bench fell in error in holding that land up to 25 cents is exempted from payment of fees in all cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals are allowed. The judgment of the learned Single Judge as confirmed by the Division Bench is overruled on this count as not having laid down the correct interpretation of the law. The respondent must, therefore, pay a conversion fee as calculable on the total extent of land in their ownership.
Pending application(s) if any shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The third respondent was appointed as Chairperson of the Commission despite not having the requisite experience. The appointment process deviated from statutory requirements and public advertisement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The State (UoI) exercised a power for a purpose foreign to that for which the power is intended, amounting to malice in law. The rules prescribing mandatory eligibility criteria must be applied strictly for every public appointment under Article 16 of the Constitution. The appointment failed to pass muster when tested on this touchstone.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The third respondent effectively and capably discharged his duties over 42 months, but less than 6 months remain for him to demit office. It amounts to a fraud on the public to make appointments in departure of either statutory requirements or public advertisement.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals are accepted, and the appointment of the third respondent is quashed. The third respondent shall step down from the office of Chairperson forthwith but will be allowed to complete his pending assignments without taking any policy decisions or involving finances within a week. Fresh process should be initiated for appointment to the office of Chairperson expeditiously.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals against the judgments of the High Court in a matter related to specific performance of a contract. The decree was passed by the trial court, and the time stipulated for payment was two months from the date of the decree. However, the decree holders failed to deposit the decretal amount within the stipulated time or seek an extension of time.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly stated in the provided text. It seems that the arguments presented by both parties are not mentioned.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's judgment was upheld, and it was observed that the decree holders failed to comply with the conditions stipulated in the decree. The court noted that the judgment debtor did not seek rescission of the contract under Section 28 of the Act, but this did not automatically result in extension of time for the decree holders.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were dismissed by the Supreme Court. The court held that the High Court's judgment was correct and that the decree holders' failure to deposit the decretal amount within the stipulated time or seek an extension of time meant that they could not execute the decree.

<FACTS>
The victim's body was found with 100% burns, suggesting foul play. PW-2 informed the family members about the incident at night on 14.09.2003 and they traveled to the appellants' village. The complaint was lodged the next day.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution presented circumstantial evidence, including:
- The victim's body was found with 100% burns, suggesting foul play.
- PW-7 stated that it was not possible for the body to sustain 100% burns in the case of suicide or self-immolation.
- The appellants' inconsistent statements and behavior.
- Delay in registration of FIR (not considered unreasonable).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The circumstantial evidence appears consistent, leaving little scope for innocence. The cumulative effect of circumstances points towards guilt. An alternate possibility is not in sight.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction. The appellants were required to surrender before the concerned Jail Superintendent within two weeks from the date of judgment for serving their sentence. The present appeal stands disposed of in terms of this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The complainant had filed a case under Section 498A of the IPC against the appellants. The High Court had allowed the application to summon the appellants, but later reversed its decision. The case involved allegations of cruelty and harassment by the husband and his family.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the complaint was filed with the intention of harassing them, and that there was no prima facie case against them. They also relied on the principles laid down in the case of Bhajanlal (supra), which requires a prima facie consideration of the allegations levelled in the complaint.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court had erred in not giving a prima facie consideration to the allegations made by the complainant. The Court also noted that there was a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the continuance of the criminal proceedings against the appellants would result in an abuse of process of law. The Court exercised its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash the criminal proceedings, stating that it was a fit case wherein the High Court should have exercised its inherent powers to quash the criminal proceedings.

The case involves a dispute between the appellant and respondent regarding a consumer protection matter. The parties are bound by a Tripartite Agreement, which is the subject of controversy. The appellant's appeal challenges an impugned order that had been passed earlier.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* The applicability of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, to the dispute between the parties
* The validity and enforceability of the Tripartite Agreement
* The exclusive choice of the consumer to opt for arbitration under the Act
* The impact of previous judgments on the current case, particularly National Seeds Corpn. Ltd. v M. Madhusudhan Reddy and Emaar-3 (Emaar MGF Land Ltd. v Aftab Singh)
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made in the case include:
* The court notes that even if a consumer dispute is governed by the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, arbitration can still be opted for under the relevant agreement or document, but only at the exclusive choice of the consumer.
* The court observes that the appellant is not a 'consumer' within the meaning of the Act and the existence of the Tripartite Agreement is doubtful.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is as follows:
* The Impugned Order passed earlier is set aside
* The appeal is allowed, and parties are ordered to bear their own costs
* This judgment does not impact any proceedings between the borrower and respondent
* No order is required to be passed in certain interlocutory applications

<FACTS>
The case involves a recruitment process for the post of Food Safety Officer (FSO) conducted by Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC). The appellants, who are candidates for the post, claimed that they were qualified and should be allowed to appear in the interview. However, their applications were rejected by JPSC on the ground that they did not possess a Bachelor's degree or its equivalent as required under the advertisement. The appellants challenged this decision before the High Court, which held against them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' main argument was that the advertisement issued by JPSC contained an error regarding the minimum educational qualification for the post of FSO. They claimed that the Central Government had amended the Food Safety and Standards Rules in 2022 to make a Bachelor's degree or its equivalent in specific subjects a valid qualification for the post. The appellants also relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court, which held that an advertisement issued by a public service commission is binding on it.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was indeed an error in the advertisement regarding the minimum educational qualification for the post of FSO. It noted that the Central Government had amended the Food Safety and Standards Rules in 2022 to make a Bachelor's degree or its equivalent in specific subjects a valid qualification for the post.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, quashing and setting aside the impugned judgments of the High Court. It directed that the appellants be allowed to appear in the interview under the Advertisement No. 18 of 2023 dated 15th June, 2023 issued by JPSC. However, it clarified that since the selected candidates were never impleaded and heard in the proceedings before the High Court or in this Court, appropriate direction had to be given to ensure that their seniority position is not disturbed at this belated stage.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an employee named Mahadeo who was terminated from his service. He filed a claim for back wages and other benefits. The employer, the Corporation, contested the claim. The court had to decide on the amount of back wages and whether the Corporation's actions were legitimate.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff (Mahadeo) argued that he was entitled to 100% back wages from the date of termination till his superannuation. He claimed that the Corporation's action of terminating him without a valid reason was unlawful.

The defendant (Corporation) argued that Mahadeo was employed on a daily wage basis and earned some amount during this period. They also argued that they were not responsible for providing permanent employment to Mahadeo after his termination.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Corporation had engaged in suppressio veri (suppression of truth) and suggestio falsi (suggesting falsehood). The court noted that Mahadeo's exact quantum of wages earned was not available, but he claimed that he could not find a permanent employment due to his termination.

The court also noted that the normal rule is to grant full back wages in such cases. However, an exceptional case with sufficient proof has to be set up by the employer to escape this burden.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court modified the order of the single judge and awarded 75% of the back wages from the date of termination till Mahadeo's superannuation. The court also ordered that Mahadeo is entitled to full terminal benefits, along with interest @ 6% per annum.

The amounts due to Mahadeo shall be released in his favor by the Corporation within three months from the date of communication; in default, the said amount shall carry further interest @ 2% from such default till full payment.

<FACTS>
The case involves an election dispute where the appellant, a candidate, sought a recount of votes in an election held in 2021. The discrepancy in the count of votes informed to the appellant and finally disclosed in the official form was 19 votes. The margin of victory of the respondent was 37 votes. Three out of four candidates had submitted affidavits expressing doubts regarding the propriety of the election and would support a recount of votes. Deliberate attempts were made to benefit the ultimate victor, including using police force to remove the appellant from the vicinity of the polling area.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the appellant was that there was a disparity in the count of votes informed to them and finally disclosed in the official form. The respondent's margin of victory was 37 votes, and a recount would be justified due to the missing Presiding Officer's records and deliberate attempts made to benefit the victor.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court included that each vote has its own value, regardless of its effect in the final outcome of the election. The sanctity of each vote must be protected. It was a four-sided election with three out of four candidates expressing doubts regarding the propriety of the election and supporting a recount.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment of the High Court passed in Writ-C No.35734 of 2022 titled Sunil Kumar v. State of U.P. And Ors. dated 27th January 2023 and restoring the order dated 31st October 2022 passed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in Election Petition No.02010/2021, which directed a recount of votes.

</Facts>

<Arguments>
The appellants are entitled to have interest on Rs.28,10,000/- as per the calculation provided in the judgment.
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Considering the reasons assigned by the learned Single Judge and the fact that the respondents could not decline to refund the amount, the High Court took a view that the respondents were wrong in declining to refund the amount.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the Appellant (a real estate developer) and the Respondents (homebuyers) over the refund of an amount paid for a flat in a housing project. The Agreement was entered into in 2014, and after the possession was offered by the Appellant to the Respondents, they sought cancellation of the allotment due to a sharp decline in prices.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The NCDRC (National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission) had directed the Appellant to refund an amount of Rs.51,12,310/- to the Respondents with interest. However, the Appellant argued that only 10% of the BSP (Basic Sale Price) is a reasonable amount which is liable to be forfeited as earnest money.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court has held that if the forfeiture of earnest money under a contract is reasonable, then it does not fall within Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The NCDRC had relied on this judgment in holding that 10% of the BSP is a reasonable amount which is liable to be forfeited as earnest money.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was partly allowed by the Court. The Appellant was directed to pay an amount of Rs.12,02,955/- (balance amount after deducting 10% of the BSP) to the Respondents within a period of six weeks from the date of the judgment. The direction of the NCDRC for refund of the amount in excess of 10% of the BSP was upheld, but the award of interest on the amount to be refunded was set aside.

<FACTS>
The Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order 2012 was formulated under Section 11 of the Act. The policy aims to promote the development of MSEs by mandating government departments and their instrumentalities to procure at least 25% of goods and services from MSEs. A writ petition was filed challenging the individual grievance of a petitioner, but the court chose to examine the nature of rights created by the Procurement Order 2012 and the remedies available to stakeholders.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argued that:

*   The Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order 2012 has the force of law as it is formulated in exercise of power under Section 11 of the Act and encapsulates the purpose and object of the Act.
*   Though there is no mandatory minimum procurement 'right' for an individual MSE, there is a statutorily recognized obligation on authorities and bodies under the Act to implement the mandate, which is subject to judicial review.
*   The court will primarily ensure proper constitution and effective functioning of authorities such as the National Board for MSMEs, Advisory Committee, Facilitation Council, Review Committee, and Grievance Cell.
*   Judicial review will leave policy and decision-making to these bodies.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
*   The imposition of unreasonable conditions in tenders floated by government departments or agencies that put Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) at a disadvantage should be examined.
*   The limits of minimum turnover clauses with respect to MSEs should be declared, and policy guidelines should be issued accordingly.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the respondents, including the Review Committee and in particular the Grievance Cell, to:

*   Examine the issue of mandatory procurement of 25% of goods and services by the government and its instrumentalities from MSEs under clause 3 of the Policy.
*   Take necessary action for effective implementation of the Policy within a period of 60 days from the date of the order.
*   Declare limits of minimum turnover clauses with respect to MSEs and issue appropriate policy guidelines within a period of 60 days from the date of the order.

The writ petition was disposed of without any order as to costs.

The court noted that this provision is not merely a formality but is essential for enabling the detained person to know the reasons for their arrest and to secure their release at the earliest possible opportunity.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the petitioner's right to be informed of the grounds for his arrest, as mandated by Article 22(1) of the Constitution.

However, it was noted that there was no allegation of demand or acceptance of bribe as against the second accused (appellant).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's counsel argued that the accusation was only with respect to the misuse of authority, which does not come under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The investigation report did not find any evidence of demand or acceptance of bribe as against the second accused. The counsel also pointed out that even if the grants were made in non-tribal areas, there was no allegation of demand and acceptance of bribe.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the investigation report only spoke of an allegation of misuse of authority without any allegation of demand and acceptance of bribe as against the appellant. The court also noted that there is not even an iota of material available from the investigation report to attract the ingredients of the provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and directed that the proceedings initiated against the second accused be dropped. The court held that since there was no allegation of demand or acceptance of bribe as against the appellant, the discharge application of the appellant ought to have been allowed by the Special Court.

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case pertain to the interpretation of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which deals with dishonour of cheques.

- The appellant failed to take steps to apply for a certified copy, and therefore, their appeals were beyond limitation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the impugned order dated January 18, 2024, passed by the NCLAT and dismissed the present appeals. The court observed that the appeals were filed beyond the stipulated period of 30 days and that no sufficient cause was pleaded for not approaching the Appellate Tribunal within the time stipulated under Section 61(2) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the sale of a property, with Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 challenging the sale of a larger extent of share in an unpartitioned property. The suit was filed after a significant delay of seventeen years.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had remanded the matter to the trial Court for fresh trial solely with respect to the issue of limitation, but this decision is challenged by the appellants.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The concurrent findings of the Courts below were that the suit was hopelessly barred by limitation. The evidence produced would abundantly make it clear that Dasappa Gowdar and Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were well aware of the earlier proceedings and the decree passed in the first suit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allows the appeal, sets aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, and restores the judgment and decree of the trial court dismissing the suit as affirmed by the First Appellate Court. The parties are ordered to bear their own costs throughout.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, who purchased the suit property during the pendency of a specific performance suit instituted by the original owner (transferor). The purchase was made while an injunction against the original owner was still in effect.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
There is no clear argument presented in the given case extract. The text appears to be a judgment and analysis of a previous court decision rather than an argument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations from the case are as follows:

* A lis pendens transferee, though not brought on record under Order XXII Rule 10 CPC, is entitled to seek leave to appeal against the final decree passed against this transferor (defendant in the suit).
* Whether to grant such leave or not is within the discretion of the court and should be exercised judiciously.
* The sale transaction pendente lite is hit by the provisions of Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the impugned order passed by the High Court is unsustainable in law. Therefore, the appeals succeed and are hereby allowed. The impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside.

Additionally, if the Respondent Nos. 1 & 2 feel they have been duped or cheated by the Defendant No. 3, it shall be open for them to avail an appropriate legal remedy before the appropriate forum in accordance with law for the purpose of recovery of the amount towards sale consideration paid at the time of execution of the sale deed.

Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appeal of Nandkumar Babulal Soni, accused No. 3, against his conviction and sentence under Sections 120B and 411 of the IPC. The seized gold bars were recovered from him, and he was convicted by the Trial Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the prosecution and defense are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the prosecution argued for the conviction of Nandkumar Babulal Soni under Sections 120B and 411 of the IPC, while the defense argued against his guilt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Trial Court observed that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the seized property as the stolen property. The court also noted that there was a delay of four years in the recovery of the property, which weakened its identification. Additionally, the court found that the prosecution had not discharged its initial burden and therefore could not rely on Section 114 of the Evidence Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals preferred by Nandkumar Babulal Soni and set aside his conviction and sentence under Sections 120B and 411 of the IPC. The court directed that the seized gold bars be handed over to Nandkumar Babulal Soni. Vijaya Bank's appeal was dismissed as it had not established the identity of the seized property as the stolen property.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the complainant against two accused individuals under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including Section 509, which is a cognizable offense. The FIR was lodged 58 days after the initial complaint was filed, and the chargesheet alleges the use of "filthy language" by the accused in scolding the complainant. The case also involves a reference between the parties before the Labour Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' counsel argued that there were discrepancies and variations in the proceedings, suggesting a deliberate attempt to reclassify the nature of the proceedings from non-cognizable to cognizable or to transform a civil dispute into a criminal matter. The counsel also alleged that the complainant initiated the criminal proceedings with mala fide intentions to wreak vengeance, cause harm, or coerce a settlement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the charge under Section 511 of the IPC cannot stand since the allegations against the accused do not constitute any offense. The court also noted that allowing the criminal proceedings to proceed against the appellants would amount to an abuse of the legal process and result in a travesty of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's order dated 31.07.2019, quashing the chargesheet and the entire proceedings, was set aside by the court. The appeals were allowed, and the chargesheet and the entire proceedings in Case Crime No. 53073 of 2014 against the appellants stood quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a recruitment process initiated by the Board in 2022, specifically the notification dated 21.10.2022. The process was challenged by some candidates who claimed that they were not eligible as their qualifications did not meet the criteria specified in the notification. The High Court's division bench initially upheld the objections and quashed the selection process.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the recruitment notification dated 21.10.2022 was legal and valid, and the principles laid down by this Court in Bhupinderpal Singh (supra) supported their claim. They also relied on the Constitution Bench decision in Tej Prakash (supra), which held that qualifications must be possessed as per those prescribed in the rules or notification.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that there was no illegality and arbitrariness in the actual recruitment notification dated 21.10.2022, and the process commenced under relevant rules and directions of the single Judge of the High Court disposing of the writ petition. The Court also noted that the recruitment notification was not challenged by anyone.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment of the division bench in M.A.T. No. 1725 of 2022 dated 11.04.2023. The Court directed the Board to take immediate steps for concluding the recruitment process as expeditiously as possible.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
HDFC Bank employed two individuals, Rakesh and Deepti. They were hired in Mumbai and their employment agreements were dispatched from there as well. When HDFC Bank decided to terminate their services, they also took this decision in Mumbai and sent the termination letters from there. Rakesh and Deepti then filed lawsuits against HDFC Bank in Patna.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by HDFC Bank include:
- The employment agreements between HDFC Bank and Rakesh and Deepti contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause, meaning that any disputes arising from these contracts could only be decided by courts in Mumbai.
- The courts in Mumbai have the necessary jurisdiction to decide on the dispute as all decisions related to their employment were taken there.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Patna High Court initially allowed HDFC Bank's application to reject Rakesh and Deepti's plaints under Order VII, Rule 11 of the CPC. However, this was a fundamental error on the part of the court, as it should have directed the return of the plaints to the trial court for their presentation in a competent court in Mumbai instead.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld HDFC Bank's claim that the suits should have been instituted in an appropriate court in Mumbai. The court noted that the Patna High Court had correctly held in favor of HDFC Bank on the point of law but committed a fundamental error by rejecting Rakesh and Deepti's plaints.
- The Supreme Court directed the trial court to return the plaints to Rakesh and Deepti for their presentation before the competent court in Mumbai. This included granting them liberty to present such plaints in the competent court in Mumbai or have their pending suits withdrawn and file a fresh suit there.
- The Supreme Court also granted Rakesh and Deepti liberty to seek amendment of their respective plaints if they wished to institute fresh suits in the competent courts in Mumbai. This included allowing them to plead grounds for exemption from the law of limitation in terms of Order VII, Rule 6 of the CPC if they chose to file new suits.
- The Supreme Court clarified that it did not examine the merits of the disputes and left all points open.

The impugned judgment and order of the Patna High Court were affirmed in part, with the lead appeal being dismissed. However, the connected appeal was allowed, and the impugned judgment and order of the Delhi High Court were set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquittal of three accused individuals, Nusrat Parween/appellant No. 1, Ahmad Khan/appellant No. 2, and Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3, who were charged with a crime related to the disappearance of Hamida Parween/deceased. The facts of the case include:
- The deceased's husband had passed away, and the accused persons allegedly quarreled with her for usurping the entire Holding No. 13.
- The first informant, Md. Firoj/PW4, alleged in the FIR that the accused persons had quarreled with Hamida Parween/deceased in the morning of the incident and were seen fleeing away together in a tempo.
- The maternal family relatives of Hamida Parween/deceased came out with a categoric assertion that after her husband's death, the accused persons were continuously quarreling with her for usurping the entire Holding No. 13.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court include:
- The prosecution failed to prove the chain of incriminating circumstances against the accused-appellants by convincing evidence and beyond the shadow of doubt.
- The trial Court as well as the High Court erred in appreciating the evidence and holding that the prosecution has proved the case against the accused-appellants beyond all manner of doubt.
- The court noted that Md. Firoj/PW4 came to the police station only on the morning of 12th March, 1997 for the first time and made a complaint regarding the disappearance of his sister upon which an entry was made in the station diary at Serial No. 517.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The prosecution story is doubtful due to the utter indifference of the family members in taking any measures after being informed about the missing of Hamida Parween/deceased and noticing the lock on the door of the house.
- The maternal family relatives' categoric assertion that after the death of Hamida Parween's husband, the accused persons were continuously quarreling with her for usurping the entire Holding No. 13 makes the entire prosecution story doubtful.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:
- The impugned judgment dated 19th January, 2011 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and judgments and orders dated 25th November, 2003, and 1st December, 2003 passed by the trial Court are hereby reversed and set aside.
- The accused-appellants, namely, Nusrat Parween/appellant No. 1, Ahmad Khan/appellant No. 2, and Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3 are acquitted of the charges.
- Nusrat Parween/appellant No. 1 and Ahmad Khan/appellant No. 2 are on bail. They need not surrender. Their bail bonds are discharged.
- If Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3 is in custody, he shall be released forthwith, if not wanted in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a conviction of the appellant for an unknown crime (likely murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder) based on an extra-judicial confession made before several witnesses. The appellant's conviction and sentence were upheld by the Sessions Judge and later by the High Court.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The prosecution relies heavily on the extra-judicial confession made by the accused, which is deemed unreliable due to contradictions and material omissions in the testimonies of PW3 and PW6. The court notes that an omission can amount to a contradiction when it is significant and relevant, as per Section 162 CrPC.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observes that the prosecution witnesses' testimonies lack credibility due to material contradictions and omissions. No corroborating circumstances have been brought on record by the prosecution. The court also notes that suspicion, however strong, cannot take the place of hard evidence.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court sets aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant, ruling that it is unsafe to sustain the conviction based on weak circumstantial evidence with credibility issues. The court grants the benefit of doubt to the appellant and orders his release from custody if not required in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a person, referred to as the appellant, who is accused of financial misconduct and involvement in transactions constituting money laundering. The allegations are severe and grave, and the quantum of proceeds of crime involved far exceeds the statutory threshold.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the respondent include:
- The offence alleged against the appellant is a continuing offence under the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act).
- The quantum of proceeds of crime involved far exceeds the statutory threshold, requiring proper investigation and judicial scrutiny.
- Cases involving economic offences necessitate a thorough trial to unearth the complete chain of events, financial transactions, and culpability of the accused.
- Discharging the appellant at this stage would be premature and contrary to the principles governing prosecution in money laundering cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The PMLA was enacted to combat the menace of money laundering and curb the use of proceeds of crime in the formal economy.
- Courts must adopt a strict approach in matters concerning economic offences to ensure that perpetrators do not exploit procedural loopholes to evade justice.
- A proper trial is necessary to evaluate the evidence produced by the appellant, analyze the complete chain of final transactions, and find out the veracity of the severe allegations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
- The appeal is dismissed.
- The findings of the Courts below are well-reasoned and do not call for interference.
- Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a CBI investigation against several appellants, who are bank employees accused of commissioning offenses. The chargesheet was filed at an initial stage of the proceedings.
The appellants had initiated a proceeding for settlement with the Bank prior to the filing of the chargesheet, and the finalization of this settlement took place before the charges were framed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that the criminal case against the appellants has an overwhelming and pre-dominant civil character arising out of pure commercial transactions where the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongst themselves.
It was also contended that no loss had been caused to the Bank, as the principal amount had been returned along with an additional amount on the basis of the settlement.
The defense further argued that the possibility of conviction against the appellants is remote and bleak, and continuation of the criminal proceedings would put them to great oppression and prejudice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court observed that the stage and timing of the settlement play a crucial role in determining whether to exercise power under Section 482 of the CrPC 1973 or not. It was noted that cases where settlement has arrived at either immediately or in close vicinity after the alleged commission of offense, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal proceeding/investigation.
In this case, the settlement had taken place prior to the filing of the chargesheet against the Appellants by the CBI.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This Court allowed the appeal and held that the High Court should have exercised its powers and jurisdiction under Section 482 to quash the proceedings. The impugned order dated 05.05.2017 passed by the High Court was hereby quashed and set aside.
As a consequence, the criminal proceedings against the Appellants arising out of FIR RC No.13(E)/2008-CBI, BS & FC, Mumbai are quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the classification of pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as "edible oil" under the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The respondents marketed and sold the coconut oil during a specific period, and the Revenue department classified it under Heading 3305 (toilet and cosmetic preparations). The respondents claimed that the coconut oil should be classified under Heading 1513 (edible oils).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Revenue department argued that the expression "for use" in Heading 3305 meant "intended for use", not "actual use". They also relied on State of Haryana vs. Dalmia Dadri Cement Ltd. to support their contention.
The respondents argued that the coconut oil was marketed and sold as an edible oil, and its packaging did not meet the requirements set out in Chapter Note 3 in Section VI-Chapter 33 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. They relied on Dunlop India Ltd. vs. Union of India and others to support their claim that specific headings should be given precedence over general headings.
The court also considered the burden of proof and the requirement for the Revenue department to adduce proper evidence to classify the goods under a particular heading or sub-heading different from that claimed by the assesses.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that it is good fiscal policy not to put people in doubt and quandary about their liability to pay duty. The court also noted that when an article has a reasonable claim to be classified under an enumerated item in the Tariff Schedule, it should not be denied that parentage and consigned to the residuary clause.
The court further observed that certainty and consistency in the stand of the Revenue department are essential for proper classification and duty payment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as "edible oil" would be classifiable under Heading 1513 in Section III-Chapter 15 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, unless the packaging thereof satisfies all the requirements set out in Chapter Note 3 in Section VI-Chapter 33 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985.
The court dismissed the appeals and held that the impugned orders did not brook interference on any count. The parties were ordered to bear their own costs.

- The court also declared the sale deed executed in favor of the respondent as null and void.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the recovery proceedings initiated by the Civil Supplies Corporation against the Rice Millers. The Corporation claimed that the payment was a "public demand" under the relevant Act. The Rice Millers challenged this, arguing that the initiation of recovery proceedings and their continuation were vitiated by procedural irregularities.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The main arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

- The Civil Supplies Corporation argued that the recovery proceedings were valid and justified, as they involved the procurement, milling, and distribution of public grain, which falls within the definition of "public demand" under the Act.
- The Rice Millers contended that the initiation of recovery proceedings was not in accordance with the procedure stipulated under the Act, and that the principles of natural justice were violated.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
Some key observations from the case are:

- The Division Bench correctly determined that the recovery proceedings initiated by the Civil Supplies Corporation were valid and justified.
- The court emphasized the availability of statutory remedies to the aggrieved persons, highlighting that the Rice Millers had failed to exhaust these remedies before invoking writ jurisdiction.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The final judgment delivered in this case is as follows:

- The civil appeals are dismissed by rejecting the contentions on procedural deviation.
- The certificate officers' jurisdiction to initiate recovery proceedings was established, and their actions were deemed valid.
- A statutory remedy is available to the Rice Millers within thirty days from the date of this Judgment. If they choose to avail this remedy, it shall be entertained without reference to delay or limitation.

Mathew was carrying on a business of procurement and supply of railway tickets without the authorization of the railways. Ramesh, on the other hand, was an authorized agent of the railways.
The first information report (FIR) against Mathew revealed that he had committed an offense under Section 143 of the Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that Mathew's actions fell under Section 143(1)(a) of the Act, which deals with unauthorized persons carrying on business related to railway tickets. 
The defense argued that Ramesh, being an authorized agent, could not be proceeded against under Section 143 of the Act for alleged breach of any terms and conditions of his contract.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was noted that the power of quashing is not unfettered or unlimited and must be exercised judiciously. 
The court observed that Mathew's actions prima facie revealed the commission of an offense under Section 143 of the Act, which fulfilled the elements required under the section.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the lead appeal and restored the criminal proceedings against Mathew, directing them to be taken to their logical conclusion in accordance with law. 
The connected appeals were also allowed, but the criminal proceedings against Ramesh were quashed.

The case involves several appeals (Civil Appeals) filed by different appellants against the decision of the Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court. The appeals are related to the eligibility of candidates for various categories, specifically OBC-NCL and MBC-NCL. The appellants had obtained certificates from competent authorities but claimed that these certificates were not valid due to certain reasons.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants relied on a 2-Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Ram Kumar Gijroya (supra) and argued that their certificates should be considered valid. They also placed reliance on the fact that they had obtained certificates from competent authorities, which should have been accepted as proof of their eligibility.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that none of the appellants had a valid certificate accompanied by an affidavit at the relevant time as per the requirement referred to above. The court also noted that the factual matrix in Ram Kumar Gijroya (supra) was distinct from the case at hand.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the correct position of law is not in favor of the Appellants, and relying on precedents and provisions of law governing the circumstances before them, the appeals ought to be declared devoid of merit. The court dismissed the Civil Appeals while upholding the decision rendered by the Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court.

The case involves a criminal appeal against the continuance of proceedings against two appellants, Geddam Jhansi and Geddam Sathyakama Jabali. The marriage between the complainant and the principal accused took place in Pondicherry, while the complainant lived with her husband and mother-in-law in Chennai. The appellants are residents of Hyderabad and do not live with the principal accused. The proceedings were initiated under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants' counsel included that:
* The materials available do not constitute a prima facie case against the appellants for continuing the criminal proceedings against them in the trial.
* Allowing these proceedings to continue would amount to an abuse of the process of the law.
* The allegations made against the appellants are general and do not disclose any specific details, making it difficult to proceed with the trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The evidence presented by the complainant is based on sweeping allegations without specific details.
* The other witnesses' testimonies do not disclose anything new as far as the appellants are concerned.
* Allowing the proceedings against the appellants to continue would be an abuse of the process of law.
* The relationship between the appellants and the complainant, being mother-in-law's sister and sister-in-law respectively, is noted but does not impact the decision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed both the criminal appeals, setting aside the impugned judgments and orders passed by the High Court. The criminal proceedings against the two appellants in "C.C. No. 46 of 2022" pending before the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Bhongir are quashed qua the two appellants, Geddam Jhansi and Geddam Sathyakama Jabali.

* Inconsistencies in witness statements
* Non-examination of material witnesses (the mother and brother-in-law of the appellant)
* Absence of motive for the crime
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted several issues with the prosecution's case, including:
* The postmortem report ruled out recent sexual activity, which made the prosecution's narrative suspect.
* There was no recovery of cash allegedly taken away by the deceased from her residence.
* Motive is a significant factor in circumstantial evidence cases and its absence weighs in favor of the accused.

The case involves custodial torture and death of a person named Shama @ Kalya. The police allegedly subjected him to torture, and he died in their custody. A performance was staged by an impersonator, Deepak Lokhande (PW-8), on 24.12.1995, to support the police version that Shama had escaped from their custody.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that sufficient evidence was adduced to prove custodial torture by the police. The defense claimed that there was no evidence of homicidal death and that the appellants were entitled to be acquitted of the charge under Section 304 Part-II IPC read with Section 34 IPC, citing the benefit of doubt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the recommendation of the National Police Commission for a mandatory judicial inquiry by a District and Sessions Judge remains unimplemented. The Law Commission of India's recommendation to insert Section 114-B in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, to reverse the burden of proof in cases of custodial death onto the police has not been taken up yet.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court maintained the convictions and sentences of the appellants as confirmed by the High Court. The court stated that when sufficient evidence is adduced to prove custodial torture by the police, it is then for the police themselves to prove their innocence. The court also noted that willful breach of regulations by a policeman causing unwarrantable personal violence to any person in his custody is punishable with fine or imprisonment.

The case involves a dispute over the ownership of certain land, with one party claiming to be a lessee and the other party asserting that the land should have been Shamlat deh. The land in question was recorded as "banjar qadim" in the jamabandi for the year 1950-51.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner, who got possession of the subject land based on a lease, cannot be heard to contend that he ceases to be a lessee. In terms of Section 105 of the Transfer of Properties Act, 1882, the transaction in respect of the land in question could only be styled as a lease.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court considered the nature of the land, the petitioner's claim for cultivation over the land, and the fact that the petitioner got possession of the subject land based on a lease. The court also took into account the definition of "Banjar Qadim" in the jamabandi and concluded that taking note of the nature of the land, as claimed by the petitioner, his claim for cultivation over the land could not be presumed for a period of 12 years immediately preceding the commencement of the 1961 Act.

The case involves the power of the State Transport Authority (STA) to delegate the issuance of non-stage carriage permits, including contract carriage, special, tourist, and temporary permits. The STA had delegated this power to its Secretary, which was challenged by various respondents.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of delegation:

* Section 68(5) of the MV Act provides that the STA may delegate any of its functions to a subordinate authority.
* Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules, 1989, clarifies that the STA has the power to delegate the issuance of permits to its Secretary.

Arguments against delegation:

* The respondents argued that the power to issue permits cannot be delegated as it is a core function of the STA.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:
* The court notes that the delegation of powers is a rational and necessary administrative measure that facilitates prompt and efficient processing of permit applications without undermining the oversight function of the STA.
* The court observes that if the power to delegate is not allowed, it would overload the STA with routine functions, potentially causing undue delays and inefficiencies in the permit-issuance process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes that:
* The power of the STA to delegate the issuance of non-stage carriage permits, including contract carriage, special, tourist, and temporary permits, is fully supported by the statutory provisions of Section 68(5) of the MV Act and Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules, 1989.
* The delegation of powers is a necessary administrative measure to meet the practical demands of an evolving transport sector.
The court rejects the respondents' arguments and holds that the High Court's reasoning on the non-delegability of permit-granting power is flawed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute regarding a gift and partition of property. The original defendants/appellants claimed that the donor, Sultan Saheb, gifted the property to his sons through a Mutation Entry. However, the Trial Court and High Court found that the testimonies of the witnesses produced by the original defendants/appellants were vague and unreliable.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the original defendants/appellants argued that the Mutation Entry constituted a valid gift, while the opposing party disputed this claim.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the primary requirement of 'declaration of clear and unequivocal intention' was not fulfilled in this case. The testimonies of the witnesses produced by the original defendants/appellants were found to be vague and unreliable. Additionally, the Mutation Entry itself did not support the claim of a gift or transfer of title.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the oral gift made by Sultan Saheb in favor of his sons was not a valid gift. The Trial Court's decision to dismiss the original defendants/appellants' claims and the High Court's confirmation of this decision were upheld. The court also clarified that registration is not applicable to gifts, and partition is foreign to this branch of personal law in the lifetime of the ancestor.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiffs had filed a suit against the defendants for injunctive relief and damages. The dispute was regarding the ownership of a property, with the plaintiffs claiming that they were the rightful owners. The defendants had sold the property to third parties during the pendency of the suit.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's decision to allow the transfer of the property was incorrect, and that the doctrine of lis pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act should have prevented any further transfers. They cited various precedents, including Sm. Muktakesi Dawn v. Haripada Mazumdar, to support their argument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the property should not change hands further during the pendency of the suit, and that the doctrine of lis pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act was applicable. The Court also noted that Rule 1 of Order 39 of the Code provides for interim injunction restraining the alienation or sale of the suit property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed, and the impugned order passed by the High Court was set aside. The respondents were directed to maintain status quo as regards the suit property as on date and not create any further encumbrances over the same in any manner. Any further transfer of the suit property pending the final disposal of the suit would be subject to lis pendens under Section 52 of the T.P. Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 302 read with Section 301 of the IPC. The incident occurred in 1992, and the accused had fired freely towards a fleeing complainant party. The first shot injured one person, and the second shot resulted in the death of a ten-year-old son of the complainant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the learned Counsel of the appellant were that the facts and circumstances of the case did not establish that the appellant had any intention to commit murder of an innocent boy. It was argued that even from the evidence, it was possible to hold that such death of the boy was absolutely unintentional and at best it could be held that such firing was a rash and negligent action on the part of the appellant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the gun was not fired in the air just to frighten the complainant and his companions, but the gun was fired by the appellant towards fleeing person even when by the first shot one of such person was injured. The Court further observed that such firing was resorted to in a locality where there were number of shops and provision of Section 301 of the IPC was clearly attracted in the facts and circumstances of the case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that even if it is held for the sake of argument that the appellant had no intention to cause death of the deceased, it will have to be held that doctrine of transfer of malice, as contemplated under Section 301, is applicable to the facts of the present case and that the appellant would be guilty under Section 302 of the IPC. However, considering the age of the appellant (74 years) and the year of the incident (1992), the Court modified the conviction from Section 302 to Section 304 Part-I of the IPC and reduced the sentence to the period already undergone.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a decree of specific performance where the balance sale consideration was to be deposited by the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to deposit the amount within the prescribed time, leading to delays in filing the execution petition and depositing the balance consideration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

*   The doctrine of merger was invoked, stating that once the decree is executed or satisfied, it merges with the judgment. However, the court held that this principle does not apply to a decree for specific performance where partial compliance has been made.
*   The issue of delay in filing the execution petition and depositing the balance sale consideration was discussed. It was argued that the decree holder should have deposited the amount within a reasonable period after the appellate court's affirmation, despite the 12-year limit for executing the decree.
*   The court observed that technicalities should not stand in the way of serving substantial justice, and the procedure should be moulded to facilitate this goal. 
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The key observations made by the court include:

*   The balance sale consideration deposited by the plaintiff was Rs. 4,87,000, which was paid on May 20, 2019.
*   There was a delay of 2 years in filing the execution petition and 4 years in depositing the balance sale consideration.
*   Simple interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum was calculated from the date of the judgment and order passed by the appellate court till the date the balance consideration was deposited.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is as follows:

*   The appeal succeeded, and the impugned order passed by the High Court was set aside.
*   The executing court's order was affirmed.
*   The balance sale consideration of Rs. 4,87,000 (with interest) was to be disbursed in favor of the defendants within a specified period.
*   The respondents were entitled to simple interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from the date of the judgment and order passed by the appellate court till the date the balance consideration was deposited.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The Appellant-MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi) had established a WTE project on Design, Build, Finance and Operate basis. The ownership of the project was to be with the Appellant-MCD, and the operation of the facility was required to be transferred back to the Appellant-MCD after 25 years. The APTEL (Appellate Tribunal for Electricity) had rejected the Appellant's application for adoption of tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the Appellant include:

* The WTE project was in the larger public interest, providing for disposal of a huge quantity of waste generated in the city of Delhi.
* The APTEL had failed to consider all relevant factors, including the mandate of Rule 15 of the SWM Rules 2016 and the financial evaluation report sent by the Bidding Evaluation Committee.
* The DERC (Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission) had granted its approval to the tariff with certain conditions after taking into consideration the relevant factors.
* The APTEL's decision was based on a hyper-technical ground, disregarding the larger public interest.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Observations made by the Court include:

* The APTEL has failed to take into consideration all aspects of the matters, including the promotion of cogeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy.
* The APTEL has grossly erred in treating the Appellant-MCD as a total stranger, ignoring the fact that the ownership of the project was always with the Appellant-MCD.
* The Court notes that the WTE project is in the larger public interest, providing for disposal of waste generated in the city of Delhi.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Judgment passed by the Court includes:

* The appeals are allowed, and the Impugned common final judgment and order of the APTEL dated 31st August 2023 is quashed and set aside.
* The orders of the DERC dated 6th March 2023 in Petition No. 65 of 2022 and 7th March 2023 in Petition No. 72 of 2022 are affirmed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court granted an interim order without formulating substantial questions of law in a second appeal. The respondents were not served, and notice was unserved to Respondent Nos. 4, 6, and 7.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
None explicitly mentioned, but the arguments can be inferred as follows:

* The learned counsel for the respondent attempted to contend that the High Court has jurisdiction to pass any interim order and that the order impugned herein is only an ad interim arrangement to protect the interest of the subject matter of the proceedings.
* However, this argument was rejected by the court, citing section 100 CPC, which mandates that the High Court must satisfy itself of the existence of a substantial question of law before passing any interim order.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the High Court could not have passed the interim order without satisfying itself of the existence of a substantial question of law, as mandated under Section 100 CPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's interim order was set aside by the Supreme Court, and this appeal stands allowed. The court held that a second appeal will be maintainable before the High Court only if it is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law. If no substantial question of law arises, the second appeal could not have been entertained.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellant and the respondent regarding an arbitral award. The appellant had entered into a development agreement with the respondent, which included a provision for arbitration in case of disputes. The respondent failed to remove two high-tension power lines from the project site, resulting in delays and commercial consequences. The appellant submitted a claim for damages and compensation before the Arbitral Tribunal, which awarded Rs. 47.75 crores as initial deposit, actual expenses incurred, and compensation for loss.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the respondent's failure to remove the high-tension power lines was a breach of contract, resulting in significant delays and commercial consequences. The appellant also contended that the Arbitral Tribunal's award was justified and should be upheld.
The respondent argued that the issues involved between the parties were trivial and could have been resolved through negotiations rather than arbitration. They also contended that the Arbitral Tribunal's award was excessive and not justified by the evidence presented.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had set aside the arbitral award, which the Supreme Court has now reversed. The court observed that the High Court's reasons for setting aside the award were not in accordance with law. The court also noted that time was of the essence in this project and each day's delay had commercial consequences.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court has modified the Arbitral Tribunal's award, reducing the rate of interest from 12% to 8% per annum. The court has also set aside the compensation for loss of Rs. 47,75,000/- awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal. The court has directed the respondent to deposit/pay the amount on or before 30.06.2025 without driving the appellant to execute the said Award. If the amount is not paid, the interest shall be at the rate of 12% per annum instead of the reduced rate.

The appeals arise out of special leave petitions (SLP) before the Supreme Court of India. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered an FIR against Arvind Kejriwal, leading to his arrest. However, the High Court's judgment on the legality of his arrest is challenged by Arvind Kejriwal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the judges in the case include the following:
- The bench notes that it has a concurrent opinion with another judge, who authored an order allowing one of the appeals and directing Arvind Kejriwal's release on bail.
- The court expresses reservations regarding certain conditions imposed on Arvind Kejriwal, which debar him from entering the office of Chief Minister and the Delhi Secretariat as well as signing files. However, these observations are made in a separate case (Criminal Appeal No. 2493/2024) and are not further discussed in this judgment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court's judgment is as follows:
- Leave is granted to both appeals.
- The appeal challenging the legality of arrest is dismissed.
- The other appeal (Criminal Appeal No. 3817 of 2024) arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.11023/2024 is allowed, and Arvind Kejriwal is directed to be released on bail subject to certain terms and conditions.
- The specific conditions imposed on Arvind Kejriwal include:

  b. He shall not make any public comments on the merits of the CBI case, which is sub judice before the Trial Court.
  c. However, this condition does not preclude him from raising all his contentions before the Trial Court.
  d. The terms and conditions imposed by a coordinate bench in Criminal Appeal No. 2493/2024 are to be applied mutatis mutandis in this case.
  e. He must remain present before the Trial Court on each and every date of hearing, unless granted exemption.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the death sentence imposed on the Appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. The Appellant's conviction was confirmed by both the Trial Court and the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court reiterates that the power to modify punishment, providing for a specific term of incarceration or till the end of the convict's life as an alternate to death penalty, can only be exercised by the High Court and the Supreme Court. The court also references Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka, (2008) 13 SCC 767 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 113, which established a special category of sentence instead of death for a term exceeding 14 years.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the Appellant's conviction is upheld, but the death sentence is modified to imprisonment for life until the end of the Appellant's natural lifespan. The appeals stand partly allowed as above.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court confirms the Appellant's conviction under Section 302 IPC and commutes the death sentence to one of life imprisonment till his last breath. The concurrent finding of guilt by the Trial Court and the High Court is upheld, but the sentence is modified as per the observation above.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appeal of an accused who was convicted of murdering two children, Master Bhuvanraj and Miss Krithika. The accused's sister-in-law, Savitha, had eloped with a man from a different caste, which led to tension in the family. The accused got into an argument with his wife about this issue and eventually committed the murders.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that the accused had no prior criminal record and that the trial court did not consider all the mitigating circumstances. They also pointed out that the accused's actions were a result of his family's restrictive world-view and his own feelings of injustice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the crime was heinous, but also observed that the accused's actions were motivated by his family's social norms and expectations. The court further stated that it should not impose the death penalty if there are mitigating circumstances that were not properly considered during trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal to some extent, modifying the sentence from death to life imprisonment without remission. The accused will now await his natural end in prison. The court's decision was based on the fact that the accused had no prior criminal record and that the trial court did not consider all the mitigating circumstances.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves capital punishment and a conviction of the accused. The trial was conducted within a period of less than two months from the date of registration of the case, which is reflective of undue haste. The trial Court relied on a DNA report without ensuring the deposition of scientific experts associated with its preparation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they were not provided an opportunity to defend themselves properly during the trial. They claimed that the trial was conducted in haste and that the reliance on the DNA report without summoning the scientific experts was unjust.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that providing a fair opportunity to the accused to defend himself is absolutely imperative and non-negotiable, especially in capital punishment cases. The trial Court's failure to ensure the deposition of scientific experts while relying on the DNA report led to the failure of justice and vitiated the trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the application filed by the appellants and remanded the case to the trial Court. The trial Court was instructed to summon the scientific experts associated with the preparation and issuance of the DNA report, examine them as Court witnesses, and provide a proper opportunity for examination to both the prosecution and defense. A defense counsel with substantial experience shall be appointed to defend the accused in the de novo trial. The entire process is expected to be completed within four months from the date of receipt of this order.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appeal is against the judgment and order of the High Court convicting the appellant for the offence of murder.
The dead body of the deceased was recovered from the house where the family resided.
The Investigating Officer (I.O.) deposed that he had drawn the panchnama, but failed to prove its contents as per law.
The I.O. testified that the discovery of the body was believable and inspired confidence.
Motive is considered a double-edged weapon and cannot be the sole basis for convicting the accused.
The prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned counsel appearing for the State argued that the husband could be the best person to explain what had happened to his wife on the date of the incident, especially considering it was a secretive offence committed within the four walls of their home.
However, the prosecution failed to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt and instead relied heavily on Section 106 of the Evidence Act, which requires the accused to explain the circumstances surrounding the incident.
The counsel for the State submitted that motive could be considered along with other pieces of reliable evidence in the form of incriminating circumstances.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court committed an error in holding the appellant guilty based on circumstantial evidence and invoking Section 106 of the Evidence Act without laying foundational facts.
The prosecution's case relied heavily on the Investigating Officer's testimony, but he failed to prove the contents of the panchnama as per law.
Motive is a double-edged weapon and cannot be the sole basis for convicting the accused, especially in a serious offence like murder.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment and order passed against the appellant is hereby set aside due to errors in the prosecution's case and application of Section 106 of the Evidence Act.
This appeal succeeds, and the impugned judgment and order are hereby allowed.
The bail bonds of the appellant stand discharged.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the sentence imposed by the High Court on two appellants, Sita Ram and Onkar Singh. The appeal was made by Ms. Sangita Kumar, who argued that the High Court's judgment was contrary to law. 
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by Ms. Sangita Kumar are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that she argued against the High Court's judgment and sought a reduction in the sentence imposed on the appellants.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The expectation of imminent death is not a requirement for a dying declaration to be admissible as evidence under Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act.
* A statement relating to the cause of death or the circumstances of the transaction that resulted in death must be sufficiently or closely connected with the actual occurrence to be considered as substantive evidence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
* The court has reached a conclusion that it should not interfere with the impugned Judgment and order of the High Court, but reduces the sentence imposed on the appellants based on mitigating circumstances.
* The sentence of Sita Ram is reduced from 6 years RI to 1 year RI while maintaining the amount of fine of Rs.5000/-. In the event if the fine is not deposited, he shall further undergo 6 months of RI.
* Onkar Singh's sentence is reduced to the period already undergone, but he shall pay the fine of Rs.10000/- if not yet paid. In the event if the fine is not deposited, then he shall undergo 6 months of RI as imposed by the High Court.
* The appeal stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between two parties related to the Shareholders Agreement dated 25.07.2011 and the Service Agreement dated 18.10.2011.
The arbitration agreement in Clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement is not disputed by either party.
The petitioner has made claims regarding entitlement to 4,00,000 and 2,00,010 equity shares in the respondent company.
Some submissions were made regarding the claim being ex-facie time-barred, which may be adjudicated upon by the arbitral tribunal as a preliminary issue.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The referral court's role is limited to examining whether the arbitration agreement exists and nothing more or less.
The parties might take undue advantage of this limited scope of judicial interference, forcing other parties to participate in a time-consuming and costly arbitration process.
The arbitral tribunal may direct that the costs of the arbitration be borne by the party found to have abused the process of law and caused unnecessary harassment to the other party.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
At the stage of Section 11 application, the referral Courts need only to examine whether the arbitration agreement exists.
The existence of an arbitral tribunal comprising a sole arbitrator for the adjudication of disputes between the same parties in relation to the Service Agreement dated 18.10.2011 is noted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The present petitions are allowed, and it would be desirable to constitute an arbitral tribunal comprising of the same sole arbitrator for adjudication of the present disputes pertaining to the Shareholders Agreement dated 25.07.2011.
The fees of the arbitrator including other modalities shall be fixed in consultation with the parties.
In the event the arbitral tribunal ultimately finds the present claims of the petitioner to be time-barred, it may direct that the costs of the arbitration pertaining to these claims be borne solely by the petitioner.
All other rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiff filed a suit based on an agreement to sell dated 29.03.1999, which was insufficiently stamped and not certified by the Collector as per the Stamp Act.
The defendant allegedly received Rs.10,000/- from the plaintiff under abnormal conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Plaintiff's arguments: 
- The document is foundational to the suit, and its admissibility is crucial for the claim.
- The failure to comply with the statutory requirements renders the entire claim unenforceable.

Defendant's argument:
- The difficulty in paying the deficit duty and penalty when the objection was raised by the trial court led to the instrument being sought refuge under Section 36.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court overlooked the statutory mandate under the Stamp Act, treating the document as admissible without resolving the stamp duty deficiency.
The document is foundational to the suit and its inadmissibility renders the entire claim unenforceable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals are liable to be allowed. 
- The amount of Rs.10,000/- received by defendant no.1 is to be returned to the plaintiff.
- The said amount is quantified to be a rounded figure at Rs.5,00,000/-(Rupees five lakhs only) and must be paid within three months from today.
The impugned order of the High Court is set aside and that of the Trial Court dismissing the suit is restored.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the levying of service tax on the promotion or marketing of sale of goods provided by the client. The appellants-assessees, who are engaged in the business of selling lottery tickets, contested this tax before the High Courts of Sikkim and Kerala.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented were:
- The sale of lottery tickets is a privileged activity by itself and not rendering of a service for which the assessees are rendering promotion or marketing service.
- Lottery tickets are actionable claims, as per the Constitution Bench in Sunrise Associates.
- The States are conducting lotteries to earn additional revenue, making it a principal-to-principal relationship between the State and the appellants.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Courts lost sight of the definition of 'goods' in clause (50) of Section 65 of the Act while interpreting the expression "lottery".
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals filed by the appellants-assessees are liable to be allowed and are allowed by setting aside the impugned judgments of the High Courts of Sikkim and Kerala.
The judgment is based on the Constitution Bench in Sunrise Associates, which opined that lottery tickets are actionable claims. 
No doubt the Explanation was omitted with effect from 01.07.2010; however, these cases pertain to the period prior to 01.07.2010.

The appeals are allowed with all consequential reliefs to the appellants.

<START CASE>
<FUNCTIAL STATUS NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS CASE>

<FACTS>
The complainant filed a private complaint against the appellants under Sections 420 (Cheating) and 409 (Criminal Breach of Trust) of the Indian Penal Code. The case was related to a business transaction between the parties, where the complainant alleged that the appellants had cheated him by not fulfilling their obligations.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the appellants argued that the complaint was misdirected and that the allegations did not constitute cheating or criminal breach of trust. They contended that the complainant had lost his period of limitation to file a civil suit for recovery of the amount allegedly due to him.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was no application of mind by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khurja, Bulandshahar while taking cognizance upon the complaint. The court also noted that the police officers often mechanically proceed to register an FIR for both cheating and criminal breach of trust without any proper application of mind.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court allowed the appeal and set aside the orders passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khurja, Bulandshahar and the High Court. The court held that the complainant had lost his period of limitation to file a civil suit for recovery of the amount allegedly due to him, making the continuation of the criminal proceeding an abuse of the process of law.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a petition challenging the provisions of prison manuals and rules in various states, which allegedly perpetuate caste-based discrimination inside prisons. The petition highlights an instance of institutional systemic discrimination where undertrial prisoners from lower castes were subjected to harsher treatment compared to those from upper castes.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioners include:
- Allegations of caste-based discrimination in prison manuals and rules, which are violative of Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 of the Constitution.
- References to "habitual offenders" in the impugned provisions, which are not defined consistently across different states and may perpetuate arbitrary arrest and detention of members of Denotified Tribes.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed:
- The petition highlights a serious issue of institutional systemic discrimination inside prisons on grounds such as caste, gender, disability, etc.
- The impugned provisions in prison manuals and rules are unconstitutional for being violative of Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 of the Constitution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

The Court issued the following directions:
- Declare the impugned provisions as unconstitutional.
- Direct all states and union territories to revise their prison manuals/rules in accordance with this judgment within three months.
- Direct the Union government to make necessary changes in the Model Prison Manual 2016 and the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act 2023 within three months.
- Delete references to "caste" column and any caste-based classification from undertrial and/or convicts' prisoners' registers inside prisons.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and its status as a minority institution under Article 30 of the Indian Constitution. The reference to the court is related to determining whether AMU can be considered a "minority" institution despite having a non-minority Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The importance of Article 30, which provides rights for minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice and kind.
* The concept that minority institutions should not be limited to those with a majority of minority members, but also include institutions established by minorities.
* The need for parity between non-minority and minority institutions in terms of treatment under the law.
* The argument that the AMU has been recognized as a minority institution since its inception and has continued to function as such despite changes over time.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* There were no rights, fundamental or otherwise, prior to the Constitution coming into force, making it impossible for minorities to surrender any rights.
* The British Indian Government was a supreme Imperial power in the country, and therefore, there is no question of surrendering any rights.
* Article 30 aims to prevent discrimination against minority communities by ensuring equal treatment under the law for one and all.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:

* The reference is answered by affirming the correctness of the decision in Azeez Basha [supra].
* The AMU has been recognized as a minority institution since its inception, despite changes over time.
* Article 30's fundamental aim is to prevent any form of discrimination or preferential treatment to non-minority communities.
* The court reiterates that the purpose of Article 30 is not to create 'minority only' ghettos but provide positive rights to minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice and kind.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Section 18G of the Income-Distressed Areas Reorganisation Act (IDRA) and its relationship with Entry 33(a) of List III. The issue at hand is whether Section 18G covers the field under "industrial alcohol" and, if so, which entity has the authority to legislate on this subject.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Court analyzed various legislative entries and previous judgments to understand the scope and meaning of Entry 8 in List II. Key arguments include:
- The interpretation of the term "industry" as it appears in Legislative entries
- The relationship between Section 18G of the IDRA and Entry 33(a) of List III
- Whether denatured alcohol is covered under Entry 8 of List II or falls under a different category
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court made several observations, including:
- The judgment in Tika Ramji (supra) was held to be not good law insofar as the interpretation of the word "industry" is concerned.
- Section 18G occupies the field under Entry 33(a) – List III, and therefore, only Parliament is competent to legislate on all articles or class of articles related to a scheduled industry i.e. “Fermentation Industries".
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that denatured alcohol is covered by Entry 8 of List II and that Section 18G occupies the field under Entry 33(a) – List III. This means that only Parliament has the authority to legislate on this subject.

The judgment states:
"In my opinion, Tika Ramji (supra) is held to be not good law insofar as the interpretation of word requirement of issuance of a notified order as a condition precedent for the field to be occupied, has been mandated therein.
...Section 18G occupies the field under Entry 33(a) – List III and, thereby, only Parliament is competent to legislate on all articles or class of articles related to a scheduled industry i.e. “Fermentation Industries”."
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Articles 38 and 39(b) and (c) of the Indian Constitution, which relate to the promotion of economic and social welfare. The court is considering whether the principles enunciated in these provisions are still relevant in light of changing circumstances.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argues that the interpretation given to Articles 38 and 39 by previous judgments (Ranganatha Reddy and Sanjeev Coke) has stood the test of time and remains relevant. The court also notes that despite political equality and equality in law, social and economic inequalities continue to persist.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the principles enunciated in Articles 38 and 39 are based on a philosophy of promoting economic and social welfare, which is still relevant today. The court also notes that despite changes in circumstances, the inequality in income and wealth remains a significant issue.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upholds the interpretation given to Articles 38 and 39 by previous judgments, reaffirming the importance of promoting economic and social welfare. The court emphasizes the need for the government to take steps to reduce social and economic inequalities and promote fairness and equity.

Justice Krishna Iyer's Doctrine is also discussed in the judgment, with the court noting its relevance and importance in illuminating the path towards fairness and equity.

The judgment concludes by emphasizing the continued relevance of Articles 38 and 39 in promoting economic and social welfare, and the need for the government to address the persistence of social and economic inequalities.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes for the purpose of reservation. The State of Punjab has implemented a policy to provide reservation benefits to certain sub-groups within the Scheduled Caste category, including the "Ravidasia" and "Balmiki" communities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of sub-classification:

* The policy aims to address the specific needs and disadvantages faced by these sub-groups within the larger Scheduled Caste community.
* Reservation benefits can be tailored to address the unique challenges faced by each sub-group, promoting greater equality and representation.

Arguments against sub-classification:

* Sub-classification may lead to fragmentation of the Scheduled Caste category, undermining the overall purpose of reservation policies.
* The identification of sub-groups may be subjective and based on arbitrary criteria, potentially leading to unequal treatment within the same community.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations from the judges' opinions:

* The court notes that while there is no inherent prohibition against sub-classification within Scheduled Castes, it must be supported by empirical data demonstrating the unique disadvantages faced by each sub-group.
* The court observes that the State's policy aims to address specific needs and challenges within the Scheduled Caste community, promoting greater equality and representation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court holds that sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is constitutionally permissible for the purpose of reservation, provided it is supported by empirical data demonstrating the unique disadvantages faced by each sub-group. The court also emphasizes the importance of identifying the "creamy layer" within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to ensure substantive equality.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Entries 49 and 50 in List II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, specifically regarding the taxation powers of a State Legislature. The dispute centers on whether "royalty" can be considered as a tax under Entry 50.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The majority decision in Kesoram Cement is questioned for its departure from the law laid down by the seven-judge Bench in India Cement, which was deemed unwarranted and overruled to the extent of holding that royalty is not a tax. The discussion highlights the differences between taxation under Entry 49 (taxes on lands and buildings) and Entry 50 (taxation powers subject to limitations imposed by Parliament).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case notes that the scope of expression "any limitations" in Entry 50 - List II is wide enough to include the imposition of restrictions, conditions, principles as well as a prohibition. The dictum in MPV Sundararamier has no bearing on the present controversy since it did not discuss Entry 50 - List II.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgments in India Cement, Orissa Cement, Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills, Saurasthra Cement, Mahanadi Coalfields, Kannadasan (excluding to the extent overruled in Tata Iron and Steel), and Tata Iron and Steel are correct and binding precedent. The majority judgment in Kesoram is overruled to the extent it holds that royalty is not a tax.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around a writ petition (W.P. (C) No. 1239 of 2023) filed in the Supreme Court of India. The specific details about the petitioner, respondents, and the issues raised are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

However, it can be inferred that the case involves a dispute between the Governor of a State and the State Government, possibly regarding the exercise of powers or the interpretation of constitutional provisions. The writ petition appears to seek relief from the Supreme Court, but the nature of the relief sought is not specified.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties involved in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the petitioners (the party filing the writ petition) argued that the Governor's actions were unconstitutional and exceeded their powers.

On the other hand, the respondents (the State Government or its representatives) likely argued that the Governor's actions were justified and within their constitutional authority.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The Supreme Court observed that the role of the Governor under the Indian Constitution is analogous to that of the British monarch. The court noted that the President does not possess the authority to act contrary to the advice of the Council of Ministers, as opined by the Attorney General in a similar case from the infancy of the Constitution.

The court also made an observation about the commitment shown by stalwarts like Dr. Rajendra Prasad and M.C. Setalvad to upholding the spirit of the Constitution.
</Observations>

<Judgment>
The Supreme Court directed the Registry to send one copy each of this judgment to all the High Courts and the Principal Secretaries to the Governors of all States.

In the result, the present writ petition stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two appeals filed by the appellants against the orders passed by the High Court. The High Court had held that the offence under the provisions of the NDPS Act is not made out, and discharged/deleted the charge under the NDPS Act framed against the accused persons.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants are based on the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra), which clarified the law as it stood from its inception and gave true effect to the meaning assigned to the relevant provisions of the NDPS Act and the Rules thereunder, by the lawmakers.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Trial Courts had committed an error in discharging/deleting the charge under the NDPS Act framed against the accused persons while disposing of an application under Section 216 CrPC. This is something not permissible within our criminal procedure.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
We direct that the accused concerned in both the appeals be tried by the concerned Special Judge, NDPS, in accordance with law. The Trial Courts are directed to proceed with the trial and conclude it expeditiously. Both the appeals filed by the appellants are allowed, and the impugned orders passed by the High Court are set aside.

The case revolves around the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) 2006 and its applicability over personal laws. The Supreme Court was requested to clarify whether the PCMA prevails over personal laws governing marriage. The Union Government submitted a note stating that the Ministry of Women & Child Development has suggested that the PCMA should be considered as prevailing over personal laws.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
Information not available
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The Supreme Court observes that there are conflicting opinions among High Courts regarding the precedence of the PCMA over personal laws. The court also notes that the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amending) Bill 2021 was introduced in Parliament to amend the PCMA and explicitly state its overriding effect over various personal laws.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court declines to make any declarations on the issue, instead suggesting that Parliament may consider making amendments to the PCMA. The court also notes that while the PCMA prohibits child marriages, it does not address betrothals of minors and recommends that Parliament consider outlawing child betrothals.

The case revolves around the principles of interim stay orders and their automatic vacation. The court is considering the applicability of Article 226(3) of the Constitution of India, which deals with petitions filed before the High Court invoking its extraordinary jurisdiction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments are not explicitly mentioned in the given case. However, it can be inferred that the court is discussing the principles and implications of interim stay orders and their automatic vacation based on Article 226(3) of the Constitution of India.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
- The grant of an interim stay order should be by a speaking order.
- A stay order once granted cannot be vacated otherwise than by a speaking order, especially when its extension also requires reasons to be recorded.
- Under Article 226(3) of the Constitution of India, the automatic vacation of the stay order envisages making an application to the High Court for the vacation of the interim stay order.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is as follows:
- A reasoned stay order once granted in any civil or criminal proceedings, if not specified to be time-bound, would remain in operation till the decision of the main matter or until and unless an application is moved for its vacation and a speaking order is passed adhering to the principles of natural justice either extending, modifying, varying, or vacating the same.

</FIRST>

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the issue of unilateral appointment clauses in arbitration agreements. The judge is considering whether such clauses enable the establishment of an independent and impartial tribunal, which is a fundamental requirement under Indian law.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
- Party autonomy is an essential feature of arbitration, allowing parties to choose the members of the arbitral tribunal and extend to procedures for conduct.
- However, when parties opt for arbitration over civil proceedings, they must establish an independent and impartial tribunal as a fundamental requirement under public policy considerations.
- Arbitration agreements that do not comply with this requirement are void under Section 23 of the Contract Act.
- The court's role is to ensure that the arbitration agreement inspires confidence and enables the establishment of an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judge notes that party autonomy is sufficiently incorporated in the Arbitration Act, but there must be a restraint on judicial intervention. The substitution of arbitration for civil courts as an exception under Section 28 of the Contract Act is only for a forum, not for contracting out of essential features like independence and impartiality.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judge concludes that:

- Dispute resolution through arbitration encompasses two independent yet interdependent principles: contractual freedom (party autonomy) and statutory obligation (duty to constitute an independent arbitral tribunal).
- Arbitration agreements must enable the constitution of an independent and impartial tribunal. If not, they will be against public policy and thus unenforceable.
- The court has the power to ensure that the arbitration agreement is compliant with this requirement under public policy considerations.

The judge further notes that it is not necessary to apply public law principles from constitutional and administrative laws. Instead, duties are sourced from Contract Act and Arbitration Act to maintain integrity in party autonomy and judicial restraint.

The occasion for examining the constitution of an independent and impartial tribunal will arise when a party makes an application under Sections 11, 14, or 34 of the Arbitration Act.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the issuance of reassessment notices under Section 148 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The tax authorities issued these notices to approximately 90,000 taxpayers between April 2021 and June 2021.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are centered on the legality of the reassessment notices issued by the tax authorities during the specified period. The assesses (taxpayers) argued that the notices were invalid as they were issued beyond the prescribed time limit under Section 149 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the reassessment notices issued by the tax authorities between April 2021 and June 2021 are governed by the provisions of the new regime introduced under Section 151 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The court also noted that the time during which the show cause notices were deemed to be stayed is from the date of issuance of the deemed notice until the supply of relevant information and material by the assessing officers to the assesses.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the reassessment notices issued by the tax authorities between April 2021 and June 2021 are time-barred as they were not issued within the prescribed time limit under Section 151 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The court allowed the appeals filed by the Revenue (tax authorities) and directed the Assessing Officers to issue fresh reassessment notices within the specified time limit.

The State Bar Councils (SBCs) are charging excessive enrolment fees beyond the express legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act, 1961. The petitioners claim that this violates their fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The SBCs cannot charge enrolment fees beyond the express legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f). This is because the Act specifically lays down the fiscal pre-conditions subject to which an advocate can be enrolled on State rolls. The petitioners argue that demanding payment of fees other than the stipulated enrolment fee and stamp duty, if any, as a pre-condition to enrolment violates their fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court notes that the Advocates Welfare Fund Act, 2001, provides for the constitution of a welfare fund for the benefit of advocates. The SBCs are required to pay annually to the welfare fund an amount equal to twenty per cent of the enrolment fee received by it under Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court holds that:

*   The SBCs cannot charge "enrolment fees" beyond the express legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f).
*   Section 24(1)(f) specifically lays down the fiscal pre-conditions subject to which an advocate can be enrolled on State rolls.
*   The decision of the SBCs to charge fees and charges at the time of enrolment in excess of the legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f) violates Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
*   This decision will have prospective effect, meaning that the SBCs are not required to refund the excess enrolment fees collected before the date of this judgment.

1. Judicial review of the decision taken by GEAC and MoEF&CC is permissible.
2. There was a consensus on the Bench that a National Policy with regard to GM crops should be formulated.
3. The State Governments should be involved in evolving the National Policy on GM crops.
4. The credentials and past records of any expert participating in the decision-making process should be verified, and conflict of interest, if any, should be declared and mitigated.
5. Section 23 of FSSA, 2006, which deals with packaging and labelling of foods, should be complied with in the matter of importing GM food and particularly GM edible oil.

2. For the aforesaid purpose, the MoEF&CC shall conduct a national consultation, preferably within the next four months, with the aim of formulating the National Policy on GM crops.
3. The respondent-Union of India must ensure that all credentials and past records of any expert who participates in the decision-making process should be scrupulously verified and conflict of interest, if any, should be declared and suitably mitigated by ensuring representation to a wide range of interests.

The case involves the approval of a combination under Section 31(1) of the Competition Act, 2002. The independent sugar corporation's (Independent Sugar Corporation Ltd.) acquisition of HNGIL's assets has been challenged by various parties. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had approved the combination in its order dated October 14, 2020.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the CCI's approval of the combination was incorrect, and they sought to set aside the said approval. They contended that the NCLT erred in allowing the combination despite not being notified under Section 6(2) of the Competition Act.
The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the appellants' contentions were unfounded and lacked merit. They pointed out that the appellants had failed to comply with the CCI's directions to provide information regarding the proposed combination. The respondents also argued that the NCLT's order approving the combination was not a judgment but an administrative decision.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations from the case include:
• The case highlights the importance of following the procedural requirements under Section 6(2) of the Competition Act for notifying combinations.
• The CCI's approval of the combination was based on the assumption that the proposed combination would not have an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC).
• The NCLT's order approving the combination was not challenged by the appellants before the appellate tribunal under Section 53-T(3) of the Competition Act.
• The respondents' counsel argued that the CCI had correctly assessed the market shares and AAEC, taking into account various factors such as installed capacity, consented capacities, and actual production.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is as follows:
The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals filed by the Independent Sugar Corporation Ltd. and others against the approval of the combination under Section 31(1) of the Competition Act, 2002.

Brother Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia concurred with the opinion that had been penned by me (Hrishikesh Roy), while Brother Justice S.V.N. Bhatti decided to write a separate opinion canvassing an alternate view, reaching a different conclusion.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the sale of the secured asset was legitimate and that the title had been transferred to them through a valid sale certificate.
The borrower and subsequent transferee, on the other hand, claimed that the sale was invalid and that they were entitled to recover their dues from the petitioner.
</ARGUMENTS>

The case revolves around the prosecution of an individual for storing or possessing Child Sexual Exploitative Material (CSEAM) under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The High Court had quashed the criminal proceedings against the accused, which was challenged by the state in the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the prosecution included:
- The POCSO Act does not require a specific number of images or videos to be considered as CSEAM.
- The accused had knowingly stored and possessed CSEAM on his device, which is a punishable offense under the POCSO Act.
- The High Court's decision to quash the proceedings was based on an incorrect interpretation of the law.

The defense argued that:
- There was no evidence to prove that the accused had distributed or transmitted the CSEAM.
- The number of images and videos found on the device was not substantial enough to constitute a punishable offense under the POCSO Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that:
- The High Court's decision to quash the proceedings was incorrect, as it misinterpreted the law regarding CSEAM.
- The prosecution had provided sufficient evidence to prove that the accused had knowingly stored and possessed CSEAM on his device.
- The POCSO Act is a comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting children from sexual offenses, and its provisions should be strictly enforced.

The court also noted that:
- Raising awareness about the realities of child sexual exploitative material and its consequences through public campaigns can help reduce its prevalence.
- Identifying at-risk individuals early and implementing intervention strategies for youth with problematic sexual behaviors (PSB) requires a coordinated effort among various stakeholders, including educators, healthcare providers, law enforcement, and child welfare services.

The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962, which deals with the powers of a proper officer to issue show-cause notices. The court is considering whether certain officers had the authority to issue such notices.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments for the petitioners (Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd.) include:

*   The show-cause notices were issued within the limitation period, as per the court's previous ruling in Canon India (Supra).
*   The proper officers had the authority to issue show-cause notices under Section 28.
*   The High Court of Delhi in Mangali Impex (Supra) was set aside by the Supreme Court.

Arguments against the petitioners include:

*   The limitation period for issuing show-cause notices had expired.
*   Certain officers did not have the authority to issue such notices under Section 28.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the previous ruling in Canon India (Supra) regarding the limitation period remains undisturbed. The Supreme Court also noted that the view taken by the High Court of Bombay in Sunil Gupta (Supra) is upheld, and the constitutional validity of Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 is confirmed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the Review Petition No. 400/2021 titled Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. and connected Review Petitions Nos. 401/2021, 402/2021, and 403/2021 insofar as the issue of jurisdiction of the proper officer to issue show-cause notices under Section 28 is concerned.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the classification of mobile towers and pre-fabricated buildings (PFBs) as inputs under Rule 2(k) of the CENVAT Rules. The Assessee claimed that these items are inputs for providing mobile telecommunication services, but the Commissioner of Central Excise rejected this plea.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Assessee argued that towers and PFBs are used for providing output services under sub-clause (ii) of Rule 2(k), which defines "input" as all goods, except light diesel oil, high speed diesel oil, motor spirit, commonly known as petrol and motor vehicles, used for providing any output service.
The Delhi High Court upheld the Assessee's plea, ruling that towers and PFBs are indeed inputs under Rule 2(k) and are eligible for credit benefits under the CENVAT Rules.
On the other hand, the Bombay High Court disagreed with the Delhi High Court's judgment, holding that towers and PFBs are not inputs but immovable property and therefore not excisable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the Assessee's plea was initially rejected by the Commissioner of Central Excise on the ground that towers and PFBs are immovable structures and hence non-marketable and non-excisable. However, the Delhi High Court overturned this decision.
The court also noted that Explanation-2 to Rule 2(k) provides that input includes goods used in the manufacture of capital goods which are further used in the factory of the manufacturer, but ruled that this explanation is not applicable in this case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld the Delhi High Court's judgment and ruled that towers and PFBs are inputs under Rule 2(k) for the purpose of credit benefits under the CENVAT Rules. The court also set aside the Bombay High Court's judgment in Bharti Airtel (supra).
Consequently, all connected appeals were disposed of in terms of the above findings and conclusions.

<START CASE>
<FUNCTI0NAL ANALYSIS>

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the imposition and collection of user fees or tolls by NTBCL, a concessionaire, on behalf of NOIDA and State authorities. The dispute centers on the Concession Agreement and its provisions regarding the levy of fees or tolls. Respondent No. 1, a welfare association, filed a writ petition in public interest challenging the contract awarded to NTBCL as unfair and unjust.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court entertained the writ petition due to the locus standi of Respondent No. 1. The court held that there was no delay or laches in approaching the court. The Concession Agreement was deemed unfair, unjust, and inconsistent with Constitutional norms. NOIDA exceeded its authority by delegating the power to levy fees or impose tolls to NTBCL, rendering such delegation invalid. Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, read with the formula in Annexure F, contravenes public policy and is liable to be severed from the Agreement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that since NTBCL has recovered the project costs and substantial profits through the imposition of user fees/tolls, there is no justification for continued collection. The issue pertaining to outdoor licensing fees between NOIDA and NTBCL does not fall within the purview of the present challenge.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment restraining the imposition and collection of user fees or tolls was upheld by the court. It was clarified that the matter concerning arbitration proceedings between NOIDA and NTBCL will be heard and decided separately on its own merit. The instant appeal is dismissed, and it was ordered accordingly.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute related to the sale of a subject property under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The Auction Purchaser had participated in the e-auction and had confirmed the bid for the subject property. However, the Appellant, who was one of the creditors, objected to the sale claiming that the auction process was unfair.
The subject property was valued at ₹39,41,28,800/- as per the Reports submitted by the Registered Valuers appointed by the Liquidator. The Auction Purchaser had initially bid a lower amount, but after deducting 25% from the initial value, the new bid came to ₹29,55,96,375/-.
The Appellant claimed that the auction process was unfair and sought cancellation of the sale or declaration of the Sale Deed as void.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the Appellant argued that the auction process was unfair, while the Auction Purchaser defended their bid and participation in the e-auction.
Information about the specific arguments made by each party is not available.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that repeated interferences in public auctions can cause uncertainty and frustrate the very purpose of holding auctions. The Court also noted that courts must ordinarily refrain from setting aside an auction unless there are serious flaws, such as perpetration of a fraud or collusion.
The Court further observed that the Appellant had taken 19 months to prefer an appeal against the order passed by the Adjudicating Authority and had resisted handing over possession of the subject property, thereby causing delay.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court partly allowed the appeals and directed the Auction Purchaser to pay an additional amount of ₹5,00,00,000/- (Rupees Five crore only) with interest @ 9% p.a. reckoned from 26th March, 2020 till date of actual payment.
The said amount was to be deposited by the Auction Purchaser with the Liquidator within eight weeks from the date of the order. Thereafter, the Liquidator would disburse the amount received in terms of the orders passed/may be passed by the Adjudicating Authority under the IBC.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a challenge to the validity of sanction under Section 22A of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The appellant claims that he is an uneducated person who is a munshi and whose identity has been stolen by two individuals (A-7 & A-14). The case also involves the alleged commission of an offence by a company, which the appellant was a director of.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are:

*   The validity of sanction should be challenged at the earliest instance available, before the Trial Court. If such a challenge is raised at an appellate stage, it would be for the person raising the challenge to justify the reasons for bringing the same at a belated stage.
*   The timelines mentioned in Rules 3 & 4 of the 2008 Rules are couched in mandatory language and, therefore, have to be strictly followed. This is keeping in view that UAPA being a penal legislation, strict construction must be accorded to it.
*   Sections 218-222, CrPC, are not violated. In respect of Section 223, the position of law is the one taken in Paras Nath Singh (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that whether or not the exemption under Section 22A applies is a matter to be established by way of evidence for the person claiming such exemption has to demonstrate that either he was not in charge of the affairs of the company which has allegedly committed the offence, or that he had made reasonable efforts to prevent the commission of the offence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal, stating that it lacked merit. The pending applications were disposed of accordingly.

<FACTS>
The Madarsa Act was enacted to regulate the standard of education in Madarsas recognized by the Board for imparting Madarsa education. The High Court of Judicature at Allahabad had ruled that the Madarsa Act suffers from an infirmity on the principle of secularism and other contentions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The State government's action in enacting regulations to ensure that religious minority institutions impart secular education of a requisite standard without destroying their minority character was challenged. The respondents argued that the Madarsa Act is inconsistent with the positive obligation of the State to ensure that students studying in recognized Madarsas attain a level of competency which will allow them to effectively participate in society and earn a living.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the purpose behind the Madarsa Act was to remove difficulties in running Madarsas, improve their merit, and provide adequate facilities to students studying in these institutions. The court noted that the legislature would have still enacted the statute if it were aware that the portions pertaining to higher education were invalid.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 22 March 2024 and held that only the provisions which pertain to Fazil and Kamil are unconstitutional, and the Madarsa Act otherwise remains valid. The court also stated that Article 21-A and the RTE Act have to be read consistently with the right of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the maintainability of an application for grant of anticipatory bail by an accused who is already in judicial custody in a different offence.
The respondent accused had filed an application for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The issue before the court was whether an anticipatory bail application can be maintained by an accused who is already in judicial custody in a different case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Mr. Luthra, representing the appellant, argued that the issue has already been dealt with and decided by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra).
He contended that the dictum laid down in the said case is that an anticipatory bail application filed by an accused in a different case, while he is in custody in one case, would not be maintainable.
However, the court rejected this submission and held that the question of maintainability of an application for grant of anticipatory bail by an accused who is already in judicial custody in relation to some offence was not examined in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the scheme of the CrPC and the decision in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra) do not preclude an accused who is already in judicial custody from filing an application for anticipatory bail.
It was noted that the court had no occasion to go into the question of maintainability of an application for grant of anticipatory bail by an accused who is already in judicial custody in relation to some offence in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra).
The court further observed that each of such applications will have to be decided by the competent courts on their own merits.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court of Judicature at Bombay shall now proceed to decide the anticipatory bail application filed by the respondent accused on its own merits.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
The Registry shall forward one copy each of this judgment to all the High Courts across the country.
The present appeal must fail and the same is thereby dismissed.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal proceeding pending before the CJM, Firozabad. The prosecution alleges that respondent nos. 3, 4, and 5 registered a false case under the Excise Act, and respondent no. 1 was involved in the alleged conspiracy to murder. The High Court had quashed the proceedings in Case Nos. 67 of 2008 and 67A of 2009.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the respondents had conspired to register a false case, which is a serious offense under the law. They also argue that the requirement of sanction for prosecution under Section 197 CrPC should not be a barrier in proceeding with the trial, especially when there are legitimate doubts regarding the need for sanction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the High Court erred in quashing the proceedings without considering the aspect of sanction for prosecution. The court also notes that the trial court had taken cognizance of the charge sheets and proceeded with the trial, which was a correct approach.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that the criminal proceedings pending before the CJM, Firozabad should not have been quashed at such a preliminary stage. The court directs the Trial Court to proceed with the trial and conclude it expeditiously preferably within one year from today. The question of sanction for respondent nos. 3, 4, and 5 is left open to be decided by the Trial Court at a suitable stage.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the CGST Act. The petitioners are owners of shopping malls, warehouses, and other buildings who claim that their constructions should be considered as "plant" under clause (d) of Section 17(5), thereby allowing them to claim input tax credit.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d) cannot be given the same meaning as the expression "plant and machinery" defined by the explanation to Section 17. They also argued that buildings, other than hotels and cinema theaters, cannot be considered as plants within the meaning of Section 17(5)(d).
The petitioners argued that their constructions were essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease, which are covered by clauses (2) and (5) of Schedule II of the CGST Act. They claimed that a functionality test should be applied to determine whether a building is a plant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the question of whether a mall, warehouse or any building other than a hotel or a cinema theatre can be classified as a plant within the meaning of the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d) is a factual question which has to be determined keeping in mind the business of the registered person and the role that building plays in the said business.
The court also observed that the construction of an immovable property can be held to be a plant if it was essential for carrying out the activity of supplying services, such as renting or giving on lease. A functionality test will have to be applied to decide whether a building is a plant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the CGST Act. It held that the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d) cannot be given the same meaning as the expression "plant and machinery" defined by the explanation to Section 17.
The court also held that buildings, other than hotels and cinema theaters, cannot be considered as plants within the meaning of Section 17(5)(d).
However, the court remanded the writ petitions to the High Court of Orissa for limited purposes of deciding whether, in the facts of the case, the shopping mall is a "plant" in terms of clause (d) of Section 17(5).
The court also held that each case will have to be decided on its merit by applying the functionality test in terms of this judgment.

<FACTS>
The case involves Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, who has been arrested and is facing charges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The Enforcement Directorate had filed a case against him in 2022. Kejriwal was granted interim bail on certain conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court analyzed the reasons for arresting Arvind Kejriwal and found that they were not sufficient to justify his detention under PMLA. The court noted that the "reasons to believe" clause in PMLA is a stringent test, and the Enforcement Directorate had failed to meet this standard.
The court also discussed the concept of "need and necessity to arrest," which is mentioned in PMLA. However, it referred these questions to a larger Bench for further consideration.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that Arvind Kejriwal has suffered incarceration for over 90 days and noted that the right to life and liberty is sacrosanct. The court directed that Kejriwal may be released on interim bail on certain conditions, which include not visiting the Office of the Chief Minister and the Delhi Secretariat, not signing official files unless necessary, not making any comments regarding his role in the case, and not interacting with witnesses or accessing official files connected to the case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court referred the matter to a larger Bench for further consideration of the questions related to "need and necessity to arrest." The questions referred are:
a. Whether "need and necessity to arrest" refers to formal parameters to arrest or personal grounds and reasons regarding necessity to arrest.
b. If the answers to (a) are affirmative, what are the parameters and facts that should be considered by the court while examining the question of "need and necessity to arrest."
The court directed the Registry to place the matter before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench, which may include a Constitution Bench.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the applicability of interest on dues owed to the original plaintiff by the defendant company. The defendant company was declared a sick industrial company under the 1985 Act and was undergoing BIFR proceedings. The original plaintiff instituted a suit against the original defendants, which resulted in a decree being awarded in favor of the original plaintiff.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the main argument revolves around the applicability of interest on dues owed to the original plaintiff.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that for the period during which the defendant company was a sick industrial company under the 1985 Act, the withholding of payment of dues by the original defendants cannot be said to be wilful and intentional. This is because the liability of the original defendants was disputed and was finally adjudicated only after the BIFR proceedings had come to an end.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the interest provision under the 1993 Act is not applicable for the period between 06.11.1992 and 27.06.2013, considering that the defendant company was a sick industrial company during this period. The court also upheld the award of 24% interest to the original plaintiff on its dues as per the provisions of the 1993 Act, but excluded the period during which the defendant company was a sick company for the purposes of calculation of interest.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the respondent-CBI and the appellants regarding the sale of coal rejects by the appellants to GCWL for washing. The CAG Audit Report had raised concerns about the sale of coal rejects, leading the respondent-CBI to initiate an investigation. The appellants submitted that they had followed the agreed-upon procedures with GCWL and that the dispute was civil in nature.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent-CBI argued that the appellants had profited from the sale of coal rejects by selling them in the open market, while the appellants countered that the coal rejects did not have any commercial value. The appellants also submitted that they had followed the agreed-upon procedures with GCWL and that the dispute was civil in nature.
The respondent-CBI relied heavily on the observations made in the Audit Report of the CAG, which had raised concerns about the sale of coal rejects. However, the appellants pointed out that the Audit Report had not attained finality till date and that its observations were based on incomplete information.

The appellants also submitted that they had followed the prescribed procedures for washing raw coal to meet the specified grade for power generation at BTPS. They further argued that failure to supply washed coal would have resulted in heavy penalties and stoppage of power generation, leading to power outages in the state.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the respondent-CBI had embarked on a roving and fishing inquiry based on the Audit Report of the CAG. The court also noted that the underpinnings of what was initially a civil dispute were painted with the brush of criminality without justification.
The court further observed that the respondent-CBI had heavily banked on the observations made in the Audit Report, which had not attained finality till date. It was also pointed out that the respondent-CBI had misinterpreted the clauses of the agreements governing the parties and that the entire edifice of criminality built by them was based on incorrect assumptions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the order on charge dated 24th December, 2021, and the order framing charges dated 3rd March, 2022, passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI, were unsustainable. The court quashed and set aside these orders on the ground of grave infirmities.

*   The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 (1986 Act)
*   The Muslim Women (Rights of Protection from Divorce) Act, 2019 (2019 Act)

The arguments revolve around the question of whether a divorced Muslim woman can seek remedy under Section 125 of the CrPC and/or the provisions of the 1986 Act or the 2019 Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case highlight the importance of providing financial support to women who have been divorced, particularly in cases where they are unable to maintain themselves. The court notes that the laws aimed at protecting the rights of Muslim women upon divorce should be interpreted and applied in a way that ensures their well-being.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in this case is summarized as follows:

*   Section 125 of the CrPC applies to all married women, including Muslim married women
*   Section 125 of the CrPC also applies to non-Muslim divorced women
*   For divorced Muslim women:
    *   Married and divorced under the Special Marriage Act: remedies available under the Special Marriage Act and/or Section 125 of the CrPC
    *   Married and divorced under Muslim law: both Section 125 of the CrPC and the provisions of the 1986 Act are applicable; a choice can be made between seeking remedy under either or both laws
    *   If an order is passed under the 1986 Act, it should be taken into consideration under Section 127(3)(b) of the CrPC if Section 125 of the CrPC is also resorted to

The case involves an appeal related to the portrayal of persons with disabilities in visual media, specifically under the Cinematograph Act and Rules. The court is considering whether the guidelines for portraying people with disabilities are adequate and effective.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:

* The guidelines for portraying people with disabilities need to be more comprehensive and inclusive.
* There should be greater representation of people with disabilities in visual media, including their challenges and successes.
* Decision-making bodies must consult with and involve persons with disabilities in the implementation of measures related to portrayal.

The respondents countered by arguing that:

* The existing guidelines are adequate and provide a framework for responsible portrayal.
* The portrayal of people with disabilities is not solely the responsibility of decision-makers but also involves writers, directors, producers, and actors.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:

* The under-representation of people with disabilities in visual media is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.
* Visual media has the power to shape public perceptions and influence societal attitudes towards people with disabilities.
* Training and sensitization programs for individuals involved in creating visual media content are essential for promoting responsible portrayal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

* The guidelines for portraying people with disabilities need to be more comprehensive and inclusive, taking into account the diverse experiences of persons with disabilities.
* Decision-making bodies must consult with and involve persons with disabilities in the implementation of measures related to portrayal, adhering to the "nothing about us without us" principle.
* Training and sensitization programs should be implemented for individuals involved in creating visual media content to emphasize the impact of their portrayals on public perceptions and the lived experiences of persons with disabilities.

The case involves a dispute over forest land declared under the A.P. Land Revenue Act, 1317 F. The plaintiff claims that he is the owner of the land and has filed an application for denotification, which was rejected by the Government. However, neither the State Government nor the Forest Settlement Officer was made a party defendant in the suit.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff's main argument is that he has not challenged the proceedings under Section 15 of the A.P. Forest Act and therefore his suit for declaration of title and permanent injunction is maintainable. The State, on the other hand, argues that the plaintiff's suit is not maintainable as the proceedings under the A.P. Forest Act have become final and conclusive.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's judgment is criticized for being ridden with both factual and legal errors. It is observed that the High Court showed utmost interest in allowing the review by setting aside the well-merited judgment in the appeal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court sets aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, restoring the judgment rendered in A.S. No. 145 of 1994.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court has observed that the parents should remain extremely vigilant and careful with their children. A slight carelessness or negligence on their part may prove to be extremely costly. The pain and agony that any parents may have to face when the child is lost to such gangs engaged in trafficking is worse than death.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court has directed the police officer in-charge of the investigation of the above incident of child trafficking as reported by TOI to personally remain present before this Court on Monday, 21.04.2025.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the power of judicial review in cases of arrest under special acts, specifically the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Customs Act, and Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). The court is considering whether frequent or casual interference by courts in the functioning of authorized officers who have been specially conferred with powers to combat serious crimes may embolden unscrupulous elements to commit such crimes.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the court is considering the balance between individual liberty and the interest of justice and society at large. The court may also be discussing the need for cautious exercise of power of judicial review to prevent judicial overreach.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the court include:
* The special acts are enacted to achieve specific purposes and objectives.
* The power of judicial review in cases of arrest under such special acts should be exercised very cautiously and in rare circumstances.
* Frequent or casual interference by courts may frustrate the purpose and objective of the acts.
* Minor procedural lapse on the part of authorized officers may not be seen with magnifying glass by the courts.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:
* The power of judicial review should not be exercised unless there is manifest arbitrariness or gross violation or non-compliance of statutory safeguards provided under the special acts.
* The balance between individual liberty and the interest of justice and society at large should be maintained when exercising power of judicial review.

<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complainant alleges that the respondent bank issued a cheque which was dishonored upon presentation. The complainant claims that the court in Chandigarh has territorial jurisdiction to try the case because one of the collection branches of the bank is located there.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argues that no part of the cause of action arose within Chandigarh, and therefore, the court in Chandigarh lacks jurisdiction. The petitioner also argues that although the Court in Chandigarh has territorial jurisdiction to try the case under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, yet as the Court in Delhi also has the territorial jurisdiction to try the case, the proceedings deserve to be transferred to the Court in Delhi to take care of two situations for the petitioner (i) language barrier and (ii) convenience.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the enactment of sub-section (2)(a) of Section 142 of the N.I. Act and the Explanation thereto allows the complainant to file a complaint before the courts within whose jurisdiction the collection branch of the bank falls. The court also notes that the petitioner has not claimed that the respondent Bank has no collection branch in Chandigarh.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismisses the transfer petition, holding that no case is made out for transfer of the proceedings under Section 406 CrPC. The court observes that mere inconvenience or hardship that the accused may have to face in travelling from one place to another would not fall within the expression "expedient for the ends of justice". The court concludes that it is always open for the petitioner-accused to pray for exemption from personal appearance or request the Court that he may be permitted to join the proceedings online.

The Appellants, including Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan, filed Appeals against the approval of the Resolution Plan. The Respondents include Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Limited, Union Bank of India, and others.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Arguments made by the Appellants included that the Resolution Plan was not approved in accordance with the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. They also argued that the Adjudicating Authority/NCLT had erred in granting approval to the Resolution Plan without considering the objections raised by them.
The Respondents, on the other hand, contended that the Resolution Plan was approved in accordance with the provisions of the IBC and that the Appellants' objections were not tenable. They also argued that the Adjudicating Authority/NCLT had considered all the relevant factors before granting approval to the Resolution Plan.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Adjudicating Authority/NCLT had followed the correct procedure in approving the Resolution Plan and that the Appellants' objections were not tenable. The Court also noted that the Resolution Plan was approved in accordance with the provisions of the IBC.
The Court further observed that even if the Appellants' objections were considered, they would not have made a difference to the outcome of the case. Therefore, the Court upheld the approval of the Resolution Plan granted by the Adjudicating Authority/NCLT.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a land dispute where the appellants have been pursuing litigation for 30 years. The suit land is approximately three acres in size. The appellants have obtained a legal document (order) from the trial court, but it was set aside by the high court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented are not explicitly stated in the provided text, but based on the context and the judgment, it can be inferred that:
* The right to property is a basic human right and should be protected from arbitrary deprivation by the state.
* The appellants have been wronged in their pursuit of justice for 30 years, and they deserve compensation for the loss of their land and the time spent on litigation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the context and the judgment, it can be inferred that:
* The court has recognized the importance of protecting property rights and has emphasized the need for the state to act within the bounds of law when depriving individuals of their properties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the respondents (state government) to pay an amount of Rs. 70 lakhs as compensation to the appellants. The judgment also emphasizes the importance of protecting property rights and upholding the rule of law. The Registry was directed to circulate a copy of the judgment to all High Courts across the country and one copy each to all Chief Secretaries of State Governments.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the licensing regime for drivers operating "Transport Vehicles" in India. A driver named Sri holds a license for Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) class and operates vehicles with a gross vehicle weight under 7,500 kg. The issue is whether Sri needs additional authorization to operate a Transport Vehicle.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argue that the licensing regime for drivers operating Transport Vehicles in India is too restrictive and hinders their livelihoods. They claim that there is no empirical data to demonstrate that LMV driving license holders driving Transport Vehicles are a significant cause of road accidents in India.

On the other hand, the respondents contend that additional eligibility criteria are necessary for drivers operating Transport Vehicles with a gross vehicle weight exceeding 7,500 kg.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that there is no empirical data to demonstrate that LMV driving license holders driving Transport Vehicles are a significant cause of road accidents in India. The court also observes that the additional eligibility criteria specified in the MV Act and MV Rules generally apply only to drivers operating vehicles with gross vehicle weight exceeding 7,500 kg.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court holds that a driver holding a license for Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) class is permitted to operate a Transport Vehicle without needing additional authorization under Section 10(2)(e) of the MV Act specifically for the Transport Vehicle class. The court also rules that LMVs and Transport Vehicles are not entirely separate classes, but there is an overlap between the two.

The court further holds that the second part of Section 3(1), which emphasizes the necessity of a specific requirement to drive a Transport Vehicle, does not supersede the definition of LMV provided in Section 2(21) of the MV Act. The additional eligibility criteria specified in the MV Act and MV Rules generally for driving Transport Vehicles would apply only to those intending to operate vehicles with gross vehicle weight exceeding 7,500 kg.

The court upholds the decision in Mukund Dewangan (2017) but provides a different reasoning.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petition was filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The petitioner challenged an award made by an arbitral tribunal in a dispute between two parties. The main issue was whether the seat of arbitration was India or not.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioner were that:
* The arbitration agreement did not designate India as the seat of arbitration.
* The expression "venue" used in the agreement indicated a different location for the arbitration proceedings.

On the other hand, the respondents argued that:
* The place of arbitration was designated as India, and there was no express or implied indication to the contrary.
* The doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens could be applied to determine the seat of arbitration if multiple places were possible.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The Closest Connection Test may not always be applicable in determining the seat of arbitration, especially when there is an express or implied designation of a place of arbitration.
* In cases where two or more possible places are designated in the agreement, the doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens can be applied to determine the most appropriate forum for arbitration.

The court also noted that:
* The parties' intentions and choices made in the arbitration agreement should be given due consideration by the courts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was not maintainable as neither the seat of arbitration was India nor was the arbitration agreement governed by laws of India.

Accordingly, the court dismissed the present petition filed by the petitioner.

* The appellant shall ensure that her mobile phone remains active and charged round the clock so that she remains constantly accessible throughout the period she remains enlarged on bail.
* During this period, the appellant shall keep the location status (GPS) of her mobile phone active, twenty-four hours a day, and her phone shall be paired with that of the Investigating Officer of the NIA to enable him to identify the appellant's exact location at any given time.
* The appellant, while on bail, shall report to the Station House Officer of the Police Station within whose jurisdiction she shall reside, once every fortnight.

In the event there is a breach of any of these conditions or any other condition imposed by the Special Court independently, it would be open to the prosecution to seek cancellation of bail granted to the appellant before the Special Court only, without any further reference to this Court.

The case involves the trial of a victim under the POCSO Act, 2012. The trial was conducted in utmost haste, with the decision being delivered in half an hour's time, running into 27 pages and consisting of 59 paragraphs. The accused was not given sufficient opportunity to defend himself, as he was not served with copies of the charges, and his lawyer received the same before framing of the charges.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the trial was conducted in accordance with the POCSO Act, 2012, and that the accused was given a fair opportunity to defend himself. The defense, on the other hand, argues that the trial was conducted in utmost haste, and that the accused was not given sufficient opportunity to defend himself.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that it is humanly impossible to deliver a judgment within half an hour's time, running into 27 pages and consisting of 59 paragraphs. The court also notes that the accused was not able to consult his lawyer, as he was not served with copies of the charges, and that receiving documents by his lawyer would not be sufficient compliance unless there was sufficient time given for him to peruse them and thereafter have a consultation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that the trial was conducted in utmost haste, and that the accused was not given sufficient opportunity to defend himself. The court directs the trial court to keep in mind the mandate of POCSO Act, 2012 while recording the evidence of the victim, conduct and complete the trial expeditiously in view of Section 35 of the POCSO Act, 2012, and file an affidavit on the feasibility of introducing a comprehensive sentencing policy within six months from today.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the promotion of judicial officers to the Higher Judicial Service. The petitioners, who were not selected for promotion, challenged the final Select List dated 10.03.2023 on grounds that it was contrary to the principle of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' as stipulated in Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that:
- The promotion process adopted by the High Court of Gujarat did not fulfill the twin requirements stipulated in paragraph 27 of All India Judges’ Association (3) (supra).
- The four components of the Suitability Test as prescribed under the recruitment notice dated 12.04.2022, did not comprehensively evaluate the legal knowledge and continued efficiency of the judicial officers.
- The promotion process assumed the character of a departmental competitive examination which is distinct in its nature since it was strictly based on merit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The four components of the Suitability Test comprehensively evaluated (i) the legal knowledge including knowledge of the case law through the objective MCQ-based written test AND (ii) the continued efficiency by evaluation of the ACRs, average disposal and past judgments of the concerned judicial officer.
- The promotion process adopted by the High Court of Gujarat fulfilled the twin requirements stipulated in paragraph 27 of All India Judges’ Association (3) (supra).
- Deviating from the process of promotion duly followed by the High Court of Gujarat since 2011 would cause grave prejudice to those judicial officers who lost out in the previous selections.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The impugned final Select List dated 10.03.2023 was not contrary to the principle of ‘Merit-cum-Seniority’ as stipulated in Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The writ petitioners argued that the clause is violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution as it restricts their right to practise the profession. However, the respondents argued that the restriction is reasonable and justifiable under Article 19(6) of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that Chartered Accountants play a crucial role in maintaining financial stability and corporate governance. They must preserve their independence of view and integrity while adhering to laws and regulations. The court also noted that the importance of auditing functions for maintaining financial stability is well-recognized.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that Clause 6.0, Chapter VI of the Guidelines dated 08.08.2008 and its subsequent amendment is valid but deemed not to be given effect to till 01.04.2024. Consequently, all proceedings initiated pursuant to the impugned Guideline in respect of the writ petitioners and other similarly situated Chartered Accountants stand quashed.

The case involves the Aviation Regulatory Body (ARB) appealing against orders of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) under Section 31 of the AERA Act. The ARB had filed appeals against orders of TDSAT, challenging directions issued by the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA). The main issue was whether the AERA had exceeded its powers in issuing certain directions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are as follows:

* The ARB argued that the AERA had overstepped its authority and encroached upon the regulatory functions of the ARB, which is responsible for regulating aviation services in India.
* The TDSAT had ruled against the ARB's appeals, holding that the directions issued by the AERA were within its powers under the relevant statutes. 
* The ARB further argued that Section 31 of the AERA Act does not confer a right to file an appeal against orders of TDSAT before the Supreme Court.
* However, it was contended that if the expression "as the case may be" in Section 18(5) is interpreted to mean that a copy of the order of TDSAT must be given to AERA even if it is not a party to the appeal or dispute, then AERA can file an appeal under this provision.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed the following:
* The determination of tariff for aeronautical services is merely one of the functions discharged by AERA.
* Section 17(1)(b) grants TDSAT the jurisdiction to "hear and dispose of appeals against any direction, decision or order of the Authority under this Act".
* The expression "as the case may be" in Section 18(5) must be read to mean that a copy of the order of TDSAT must be given to AERA even if it is not a party to the appeal or dispute.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held as follows:
* The appeals filed by AERA against orders of TDSAT under Section 31 of the AERA Act are maintainable.
* The Registry shall list the matters before the Regular Bench for adjudication of the appeals on merits.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiff registered a document (Ext.A1) as a gift, which was handed over by Defendant No.1 (father of the defendant). The plaintiff took possession of the original title deed and was in possession of it when the suit was filed. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff took away the document later.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff argued that the document was a gift, which was acted upon during the lifetime of the executant (father). The factum of acceptance can be derived from the conduct of the parties, and possession of the gift itself would amount to acceptance. The defendants argued that the document was a Will, not a gift.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Delivery of possession is only one of the methods to prove acceptance and not the sole method. The receipt of the original document by the plaintiff and registration of the same would amount to acceptance of the gift. Once a gift has been acted upon, it cannot be unilaterally cancelled.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court rightly set aside the concurrent judgments of the Courts below by treating the document as a settlement. The unilateral cancellation of the document is void, and the sale deed dated 19.10.1993 executed by Defendant No.1/father is also invalid. This appeal is dismissed, confirming the judgment passed by the High Court.

The case involves three appellants who were acquitted by the High Court but then convicted in a supplementary charge sheet.

The State Government was found to be responsible for appointing an inefficient and partial Public Prosecutor.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court's judgment was flawed due to the failure of the Public Prosecutor to present relevant evidence. The court also noted that the State Government should be held responsible for appointing an inefficient and partial Public Prosecutor.
The court further stated that a Public Prosecutor must be fair, objective, and have high merit to discharge their duties effectively in administering criminal justice. They should not show a thirst for conviction at any cost, but rather strive to present a complete picture of the case to the court.
The court also highlighted the importance of the Public Prosecutor's role in assisting the court in reaching a proper conclusion in cases brought before it for trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. The State Government was directed to pay Rs. 5,00,000 each to the three appellants as compensation within four weeks from the date of the judgment. If the payment is not made, the court will take appropriate action against the responsible officer.
The bail bonds furnished by the appellants were discharged.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an ex-parte decision to set aside the appellants' selection. The appellants have continuously held office and performed their duties for over twenty-five years under interim orders.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The principle of audi alteram partem is the cornerstone of justice, ensuring that no person is condemned unheard. This principle transforms justice from a mere technical formality into a humane pursuit.

A defect at the initial stage cannot generally be cured at the appellate stage, even in cases where a 'full jurisdiction' may be available at the appellate stage. The Courts must have the discretion to relegate it to the original stage for an opportunity of hearing.

An allegation of bias can only be proved if facts are established after giving an opportunity of hearing. This process requires a fair and transparent procedure in which the concerned parties are given an adequate opportunity to present their case.

The selection pertains to the year 1998, and remanding the matter for a fresh inquiry would hardly be a practical exercise and will be an injustice to the appointees.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Providing a hearing to the affected individual minimizes the risk of administrative authorities making decisions in ignorance of facts or other relevant circumstances. This process not only aids the administration in arriving at correct decisions but also enables courts to more effectively review such actions.

The primary purpose of natural justice is to assist the administration in reaching sound decisions at the outset, reducing the likelihood of decisions being overturned later.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court upholds the opinion of Justice KV Vishwanathan allowing the appeal(s) and setting aside the judgment of the Division Bench. The selection of the appellants stands vitiated due to an ineffective hearing at the initial stage.

Since the selection pertains to the year 1998, and the appellants have continuously held office and performed their duties for over twenty-five years under interim orders, remanding the matter for a fresh inquiry would hardly be a practical exercise and will be an injustice to the appointees. The parties are ordered to bear their own cost.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant filed an application for compounding of the offence under Section 276CC of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for Assessment Year (AY) 2013-14. The Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara rejected the application on the ground that it was not the first offence as defined in the 2014 guidelines.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the rejection of the compounding application by the Chief Commissioner was incorrect and that the offence was covered under the expression "first offence" as defined in the 2014 guidelines. The appellant relied on the Guidelines for Compounding of Offences under Direct Tax Laws, 2014, which stated that an offence would be considered a first offence if it was not compoundable more than three times.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Chief Commissioner had erred in rejecting the compounding application on the ground that it was not the first offence. The court noted that there was a clear shift in policy by the Department with regards to the compounding of offences under Section 276CC, as evident from the Guidelines for Compounding of Offences under Direct Tax Laws, 2019 and 2022.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court set aside the orders passed by the High Court and the Chief Commissioner rejecting the compounding application. The court directed the appellant to prefer a fresh application for compounding before the competent authority within two weeks from the date of the judgment, which would be adjudicated within four weeks from the date of filing.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that Manager Singh's defense team argued for his release on bail due to various factors such as non-bailable warrants, charges under multiple IPC sections, and other related issues.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that Manager Singh was issued non-bailable warrants, which led to the questioning of the trial court's decision. The court also noted that the High Court had previously restricted the grant of anticipatory bail till the filing of the chargesheet.

The case involves a complaint against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regarding unfair trade practices by banks in charging interest rates on credit card defaults. The complainants, Awaz and others, claimed that the RBI had failed to regulate the banking sector effectively, leading to exploitative interest rates being charged by banks.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), argued that:
- The interest rates charged by banks were determined by financial wisdom and directives issued by the RBI.
- The credit card holders were duly educated and made aware of their privileges and obligations, including timely payment and levying of penalty on delay.
- There was no material on record to establish that any bank had acted contrary to the policy directives issued by the RBI.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The National Commission observed that:
- The rate of interest charged by banks was not unconscionable or unilateral, as it was determined by financial wisdom and directives issued by the RBI.
- The credit card holders were duly educated and made aware of their privileges and obligations.
- There was no question of the RBI being directed to impose any cap on the rate of interest either on the banking sector as a whole or in respect of any one particular bank, contrary to the provisions contained in the Banking Regulation Act and circulars/directions issued thereunder.
</OBSERVATIONS>

The case involves a dispute between the plaintiff (State of Rajasthan) and the defendant (Union of India) regarding the CBI's power to investigate cases in a state without the consent of the state government. The plaintiff alleges that the CBI has been exercising its powers in violation of Section 6 of the DSPE Act, which requires the consent of the state government for the CBI to exercise its powers in that state.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defendant argues that:
- The suit is not maintainable as it raises a legal issue that can be raised only by the Central Government and not by the State Governments.
- The plaintiff has not made out any cause of action against the defendant.
- The CBI's power to investigate cases in a state without the consent of the state government is constitutional.
The plaintiff argues that:
- Section 6 of the DSPE Act requires the consent of the state government for the CBI to exercise its powers in that state.
- The CBI cannot continue to register and investigate cases in a state after withdrawal of consent by the state government.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
- The plaintiff's case is based on Section 6 of the DSPE Act, which requires the consent of the state government for the CBI to exercise its powers in that state.
- The CBI's power to investigate cases in a state without the consent of the state government has been challenged by the plaintiff.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court rejects the preliminary objection raised by the defendant and allows the suit to proceed on its own merits. It observes that:
- The contentions raised by the defendant do not merit acceptance.
- The case is related to the legal right of states under the Constitution, which was previously clarified in the State of Rajasthan v. Union of India case.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the registration of an FIR (First Information Report) No. 11202008250014 of 2025, registered with City A-Division Police Station, Jamnagar.
A poem was allegedly recited, which led to animosity or hatred amongst different communities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court exercised its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or under Section 482 of the CrPC equivalent to Section 528 of the BNSS to quash the FIR.
The court held that free expression of thoughts and views by individuals or groups is an integral part of a healthy civilized society.
It was argued that even if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that 75 years into the republic, it cannot be seen as shaky on its fundamentals that mere recital of a poem or any form of art or entertainment can be alleged to lead to animosity or hatred amongst different communities.
It was also noted that subscribing to such a view would stifle all legitimate expressions of views in the public domain, which is so fundamental to a free society.

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court quashed and set aside the impugned order and FIR No. 11202008250014 of 2025, registered with City A-Division Police Station, Jamnagar, and further proceedings based thereon.

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in this case revolve around the interpretation of Section 236(1) of the Code, which refers to the Companies Act for determining the jurisdiction of the Special Court. The respondents argued that the reference in Section 236(1) is a "legislation by reference" and not "legislation by incorporation", which would imply that only offences under the Companies Act would be tried by a Special Court.
The appellants, on the other hand, argued that the provision with regard to the reference in Section 236(1) of the Code pertaining to Special Court as mentioned in Section 435 of the Companies Act stood frozen as on the date of enactment of the Code and therefore, the learned Judge of the High Court erred in holding that in view of the subsequent amendment, the offences under the Code shall be tried only by a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the reasoning of the learned single judge of the High Court was untenable as it held that in view of the 2018 Amendment, only the offences under the Companies Act would be tried by a Special Court of Sessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge and all other offences including under the Code shall be tried by a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class.
It also observed that even if it is held that the reference in Section 236(1) of the Code is a "legislation by reference" and not "legislation by incorporation", still the offences punishable under the Code having imprisonment of two years or more will have to be tried by a Special Court presided by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge. 
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the Special Courts presided by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge will have jurisdiction to try the complaint under the Code.
The impugned judgment and order dated 14th February 2022, passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ Petition No.2592 of 2021 is quashed and set aside.
However, since the learned single judge of the High Court has not considered the merits of the matter, the matter is remitted to the learned single judge of the High Court for considering the petition of the respondents afresh on merits.

The case involves the murder of two women, Smt. Mamta and Kumari Sapna. The accused was present in court for 74 occasions over a period of 2.3 years but only one witness was examined during this time.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's lackadaisical approach to the case was highlighted by the judges, who noted that no explanation could be found for the non-production of witnesses on numerous occasions. The judges emphasized the importance of complying with procedural rigors and principles of law in trials, particularly in cases involving serious crimes like murder.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judges observed that the prosecution's failure to follow proper procedures had resulted in unnecessary delays and the need for a retrial. They also noted that the trial court's judgment convicting the accused was unsustainable due to these procedural irregularities.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the Trial Court and High Court, convicting the accused and confirming capital punishment. The case is remanded to the Trial Court for a fresh trial, with instructions to expedite the process and deliver judgment within one year.

The case involves an appeal related to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The appellant seeks relief from various orders passed by the High Court and the Board. The specific issues relate to the interpretation of certain provisions of the Act, including Section 14(3), which sets a three-month period for completing a preliminary assessment under Section 15.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the provided text.

</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the court include:

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between the plaintiffs and the Corporation regarding compensation for the shortfall in land area under the Town Planning Scheme. The plaintiffs had initially been allotted Final Plot No. 463 with an area of 3890 sq. yds., but were later allotted Final Plot No. 187 with an area of 2724 sq. yds. due to reconstitution of plots.
The Corporation estimated compensation for the shortfall in land area at ₹25/- per sq. mt. (974 sq. mts.), which was calculated by the Town Planning Officer under Section 52(3)(x) of the relevant provisions.
The plaintiffs claimed quantified damages of ₹1,63,97,673/- and alternatively prayed for allotment of an extent of land equivalent to the shortfall area of Final Plot No. 463.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Corporation argued that the plaintiffs did not produce any evidence in support of their claim for quantified damages, and therefore, their prayer for compensation necessarily had to be negated.
The Corporation also relied on Section 52(3)(x) of the relevant provisions, which provides for the estimation of compensation by the Town Planning Officer with reference to claims made by the property owners after notice has been given in the prescribed manner and form.
The plaintiffs' main prayer was for quantified damages based on the area of Final Plot No. 463 (3890 sq. yds.), but their alternative prayer was for allotment of an extent of land equivalent to the shortfall area of Final Plot No. 463.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court was justified in allowing the first appeal filed by the Corporation and non-suiting the plaintiffs in entirety.
No evidence was led by the plaintiffs to support their claim for quantified damages or to equate the values of the two final plots (Final Plot No. 463 and Final Plot No. 187).
The monetary value of the plots would depend on their situation, development, proximity, and access to main roads or highways.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were dismissed by the Supreme Court as they were bereft of merit.
The parties were ordered to bear their respective costs.
The judgment did not brook any interference on any count.

The case involves a complaint filed by the appellants against the respondent under the ESI Act, 1948. The respondent is registered as a factory under the ESIC Act for the same premises, but this fact was not considered in arriving at the conclusion. The process of issuing process is also cryptic and does not reflect any application of mind.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments advanced by the parties are:

* The respondent argued that the order issuing process is cryptic and does not reflect any application of mind.
* The appellants contended that the respondent's activities constitute a manufacturing process under the Factories Act, 1948.
* The respondent relied on cases such as Triplex Dry Cleaners v. Employees State Insurance Corporation (Supra) to argue that the respondent is not engaged in any manufacturing activity.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Some key observations made by the court are:

* The court noted that the definition of "manufacturing process" under Section 2(k) of the Factories Act, 1948 includes processes such as washing, cleaning, and treating or adapting any article for its use or disposal.
* The court observed that the respondent's activities fall within this definition.
* The court also relied on a recent judgment in J.P. Lights India v. Regional Director E.S.I. Corporation, Bangalore (Supra) to support its conclusion.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The appeal was allowed by the court.
* The order of the High Court in Stamp Number Main No. 944 of 2020 (F) dated 06.09.2021 was set aside.
* The consequence of this judgment is that the complaint filed by the appellants along with the order issuing process of 04.12.2019 would stand restored to file of the learned JMFC, Panaji and shall be proceeded with in accordance with law.

The case involves Doha Bank, a first respondent, and the appellants who are challenging the status of their application as secured creditors. The Resolution Plan was approved by the CoC, including the appellants and third-party lenders. The NCLAT has not held against the appellants on the ground that if their case is accepted, it will amount to modification of the Resolution Plan.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' main contention was that they are secured creditors under the Deed of Hypothecation (DoH). They argued that the definition of 'claim' under Section 3(6) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) includes any right to payment, even if it cannot be enforced due to the applicability of the moratorium. The appellants also contended that the last part of clause 5(iii) of the DoH is severable from the main transaction of hypothecation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The NCLT order dated 2nd March 2021 was upheld, and the impugned judgment and order dated 9th September 2022 passed by the NCLAT was quashed and set aside. The appeals were allowed, and the original order of the NCLT was restored.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the DoH will continue to be valid, but nothing prohibited by Section 14 can be done. The definition of 'claim' under Section 3(6) of the IBC includes any right to payment, even if it cannot be enforced due to the applicability of the moratorium. Therefore, the appellants are secured creditors. The order of the NCLT was upheld, and the appeals were allowed.

The case revolves around the notification issued by the Lt. Governor of Delhi under Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, which grants the power to nominate persons with special knowledge in municipal administration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Petitioner's argument: The notifications dated 03.01.2023 and 04.01.2023 issued by the Lt. Governor under Section 3(3)(b)(i) are in violation of Article 239AA read with Section 41 of the GNCTD Act.
Respondent's argument (implied): The power to nominate persons with special knowledge is a statutory duty of the Lt. Governor, which must be exercised as per the mandate of the statute and not guided by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court notes that Section 3(3)(b)(i) was introduced in 1993 to give effect to the two constitutional amendments. The statutory regime makes it clear that the entrustment of powers is intended to be exercised by Lt. Governor as a statutory duty.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court holds that Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act is a Parliamentary enactment vesting the power of nomination of persons with special knowledge in municipal administration with the Lt. Governor.
The notifications dated 03.01.2023 and 04.01.2023 issued by the Lt. Governor under Section 3(3)(b)(i) are not in violation of Article 239AA read with Section 41 of the GNCTD Act.
This Writ Petition (C) No. 348 of 2023 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is dismissed.
No order as to costs.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellant and the respondent, where the respondent resigned from his position as an executive director of the company. The respondent claimed that he was unfairly rated by the company's management and was subjected to personal and professional insult, harassment, and was left with no option but to submit his resignation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- Whether the respondent is considered a "workman" under the Industrial Disputes Act (ID Act) and is entitled to make a reference to the Labour Court.
- The nature of the respondent's duties and whether they entitle him to be covered under Section 2(s) of the ID Act.
- Whether the respondent's resignation was voluntary or forced by the company.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- A person in employment cannot dictate terms to their employer, and grievances should be addressed through proper channels within the organization.
- The phraseology "not of his free will" in the respondent's resignation letter does not necessarily mean that it was forced upon him by the company.
- It would be far-fetched to assume that the entire organization would turn against one individual, especially someone of high caliber and quality like the respondent.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The respondent is not a "workman" under Section 2(s) of the ID Act.
- Therefore, reference to the Labour Court under the ID Act against the appellant would not be maintainable.
- The impugned judgment and the judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge are set aside, and the judgment of the Labour Court is revived and restored.

<FACTS>
The case involves the Calcutta High Court's judgment in APO No. 523 of 2017 dated 17.12.2019, which was challenged by the appellant-Corporation through an appeal (SLP (C) No. 4504 of 2021). The Corporation had acquired land under Section 352(a) of the Act.
The High Court found that the Corporation acted blatantly in violation of statutory provisions while acquiring the property. The Corporation should have approached the State under Section 537(1) of the Act to facilitate the acquisition.
The possession was allegedly taken by the Corporation in 1991, but no compensation has been paid yet. The Corporation continued to accept property tax from the recorded owner, and it was only in 2010 that the Corporation deleted the owner's name and incorporated its own as the owner.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, based on the judgment, it can be inferred that the respondent argued that the acquisition of land under Section 352(a) of the Act was illegal and invalid.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the Corporation's action concerning the acquisition of property by invoking Section 352(a) of the Act is per se illegal, invalid, and in clear contravention to the provisions of the Act.
The observations also suggest that the Corporation had a discrepancy in its records regarding the possession and compensation for the acquired land. The Corporation continued to accept property tax from the recorded owner despite taking possession allegedly in 1991.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal (SLP (C) No. 4504 of 2021) filed by the Corporation with costs quantified at Rs. 5,00,000/- to be paid to respondent no. 1 within a period of sixty days from the date of the judgment.
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court was fully justified in allowing the writ petition and rejecting the case of the appellant-Corporation acquiring land under Section 352 of the Act.

<Facts>
The case involves a challenge to various provisions of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act in different states, including Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. The petitioners have approached the Supreme Court seeking relief.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The petitioners' arguments are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that they are challenging specific provisions of the respective Acts, likely citing issues such as unconstitutional or unjust treatment of certain groups or individuals.
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court has taken note of the fact that the challenge to various provisions of the respective Acts may require an in-depth analysis of the socio-economic, cultural, and religious aspects of the matter. The High Courts are advised to consider constituting an Expert Committee to assist in deciding the cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court has disposed of the writ petitions by reserving liberty to the petitioners to file their writ petitions before the respective High Courts. The court has observed that it is more effective for the petitioners to assail the provisions of the respective Acts before the jurisdictional High Courts.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the insolvency and bankruptcy of a company. The Resolution Plan was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in 2019, but there has been no progress since then. The Supreme Court notes that almost five years have elapsed since the approval of the Resolution Plan.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court argues that the impugned order passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) is perverse and unsustainable in law, leading to further complications. The court also suggests that the Parliament should look into the suggestions made by the court in consultation with the Insolvency Bankruptcy Board of India and the Ministry of Finance.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observes that there is a shortage of members in the Tribunals (NCLTs and NCLAT) and inadequate infrastructure, leading to operational inefficiencies. The court also notes that the strict timelines provided in Section 12 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 are not complied with.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court sets aside the impugned order passed by the NCLAT and allows the appeals. The court directs that the Corporate Debtor be taken in liquidation, and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai shall take appropriate steps for appointment of a liquidator and all other necessary formalities for commencement of liquidation.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the allotment of land at a basic rate to certain categories of people, including MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS/State Government, Judges of the Constitutional Courts, and journalists. The Government of Telangana had issued orders for the allotment of land, which was challenged in the High Court by Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions, but the judgment was appealed to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (State of Telangana and others) argued that the allotment of land at a basic rate was justified as it was based on the principle of equity and fairness. They also contended that the classification of certain categories of people for the purpose of allotment of land was rational and had a nexus to the policy.
The respondent (Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav) argued that the allotment of land at a basic rate to certain categories of people violated Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law. He also contended that the classification made by the government was arbitrary and had no rational nexus to the policy.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the allotment of land at a basic rate to certain categories of people was not justified as it resulted in inequality among citizens who were similarly situated. The court also noted that the classification made by the government was arbitrary and had no rational nexus to the policy.
The court further observed that many judges, including those from the Constitutional Courts, continued to defend the allotment despite being aware of its unconstitutional implications. This was seen as a serious breach of judicial ethics.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav and quashed the Government Orders (GoM) Nos. 243, 244, 419, 420, 422 to 425 dated 28.02.2005 and 25.03.2008, which classified MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS/State Government, Judges of the Constitutional Courts, and journalists as a separate class for allotment of land at the basic rate.
The court also directed that the Cooperative Societies and their members would be entitled to a refund of the entire amount deposited by them, including stamp duty and registration fee paid by them along with interest. The lease deeds executed in favor of the societies/members were treated as cancelled.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction of two appellants under Section 302 IPC (punishment for murder). The appellants were accused of causing the death of a person, and the prosecution argued that they had committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The incident occurred in a village where the deceased was having visiting terms with the accused persons.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's argument was based on the evidence presented by witnesses, including the mother of the deceased (Lata Bai), who testified that her son had quarreled with the accused persons. The prosecution also relied on the medical evidence showing that the injuries inflicted on the deceased were grievous and sufficient to cause death.
However, the defense argued that the appellants had not intended to kill the deceased and that the assault was not premeditated. They claimed that there was no prior enmity between them and the deceased and that the motive for the crime was unclear.
The defense also highlighted that the appellants had already undergone 10 years and 3 months of incarceration during the trial and pendency of appeals, which should be taken into consideration while determining their sentence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that although the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants had caused the death of the deceased fully knowing that the bodily injuries were likely to cause death, the motive for committing the crime was not clearly established. The court also noted that any prior enmity between the appellants and the deceased had not been established.
The court further observed that although the appellants were armed with deadly weapons, there was no clear evidence of premeditation or intention to kill.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Based on the facts and arguments presented, the court held that the conviction of the appellants under Section 302 IPC should be converted to Part I of Section 304 IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). The court convicted the appellants under Part I of Section 304 IPC.
The court then considered the quantum of punishment to be imposed on the appellants. Taking into account the period already undergone by them, the court decided that interest of justice would be served if they were sentenced to the period already undergone and a fine of Rs.50,000 each was imposed on them. The court also directed that in case of non-payment of the fine, the appellants would undergo additional 6 months of simple imprisonment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The insurance policy contains an arbitration agreement in Clause 13.
A dispute arose between the parties regarding the claim amount (quantum).
The appellant raised objections to the appointment of Justice K.A. Puj as the arbitrator, citing that the dispute is not arbitrable and the court should have decided on it instead of referring it to arbitration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement in Clause 13 of the insurance policy.
The respondent also contended that the dispute regarding "accord and satisfaction" can be adjudicated upon by the arbitral tribunal as a preliminary issue.
The court considered the previous decisions of Vidya Drolia (supra) and NTPC v. SPML (supra), but after reconsidering them in light of In Re: Interplay (supra), clarified that the referral court should only examine whether Section 11(6) application has been filed within the period of limitation of three years.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court in Arif Azim (supra) were clarified, limiting the enquiry to examining whether the Section 11(6) application has been filed within the period of limitation of three years or not.
The referral courts should not conduct an intricate evidentiary enquiry into the question whether the claims raised by the applicant are time barred and should leave that question for determination by the arbitrator.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld and affirmed the appointment of Justice K.A. Puj as an arbitrator to resolve the disputes between the parties.
The order staying the arbitration proceedings stands vacated.
All legal contentions including objections available to the appellant are kept open to be taken up before the learned Arbitrator.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a tender issued by the respondent in favor of the appellant for displaying advertisements on underpasses. The appellant had made significant investments pursuant to the terms of the tender and had erected multiple structures at different sites on the concerned underpasses.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are centered around the arbitrary exercise of powers by the respondent in canceling the tender issued in favor of the appellant. The court emphasizes the importance of adhering to contractual obligations and not using executive powers to disturb or wriggle out of them. It is also argued that the notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 was illegal, and the handing over of operation and maintenance of the underpasses would have no bearing on the rights vested in the appellant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that arbitrary terminations of contracts create uncertainty and unpredictability, thereby discouraging public participation in tendering processes. It also notes that when private parties perceive their contractual rights can be easily trampled by the State, they would be dissuaded from participating in such processes, ultimately affecting the public.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that the notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 is quashed, and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court are hereby set aside. The appeal succeeds, and the vesting rights of the appellant remain unaffected by any subsequent changes in control and maintenance of the underpasses.

*   That they had been unfairly denied an opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them by Archana Mishra
*   That the Collector failed to provide a fair hearing and did not follow proper procedures in dealing with the complaint
*   That the appointments of the selected candidates were valid and should be upheld

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that:

*   The appellants had been given sufficient opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them
*   The Collector followed proper procedures in dealing with the complaint and the selection process
*   The appointments of the selected candidates were not valid due to irregularities in the selection process

</ARGUMENTS>

</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately held that:

*   The appeals filed by the appellants are allowed
*   The judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside
*   The appeal filed by Archana Mishra before the Collector would stand dismissed
*   The appellants would be entitled to continue in service, deeming their appointments as valid and would be entitled to all service benefits.

The matter was later placed before the Chief Justice of India for constitution of a larger Bench due to divergent views expressed by the judges.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the ownership of a suit property, which has been set up as an oxygen cylinder manufacturing plant by the appellant. The respondent no. 6-ARCIL claims that it is entitled to take possession of the land due to non-payment of dues. The High Court had ruled in favor of ARCIL.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but based on the context, it can be inferred that the appellant argued against ARCIL's claim, while ARCIL argued in favor of its entitlement to take possession of the land due to non-payment of dues.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had ruled in favor of ARCIL, but the Supreme Court has allowed the appeals in part, directing the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 4,00,00,000 with ARCIL within six months to save its industrial unit set up on the subject land.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court's judgment allows the appeals in part, affirming the High Court's order but granting the appellant an opportunity to deposit Rs. 4,00,00,000 with ARCIL within six months to save its industrial unit. If the appellant fails to do so, the competent authorities will take over the possession of the entire unit and put it up for sale by fresh auction process.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a First Information Report (FIR) No. 899 of 2023 lodged at the Elamakkara Police Station against an individual, referred to as the "appellant". The FIR was related to an incident where the appellant made certain comments about his wife on social media.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are centered around the interpretation of Section 18 of the Act, 1989. The appellant's counsel argued that the section should be strictly construed, and the words imposing a penalty must be clear and distinct. They contended that the requirement of express language for the creation of an offence, strict interpretation of statutory conditions precedent to the infliction of punishment, and technical provisions concerning criminal procedure and jurisdiction must be observed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the power of punishment is vested in the legislature, not the judicial department. The court also noted that penalties are not enforceable unless they are imposed in clear terms. Additionally, the court emphasized the importance of adopting a construction that avoids unreasonable or oppressive results.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court. The court directed that in the event of arrest of the appellant by police in connection with the FIR, he shall be released on bail subject to terms and conditions deemed fit by the Investigating Officer.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellant society and the respondents, who are teachers at a private educational institution. The respondents were employed by the previous administration of the school but continued to work after the new administration took over. They claimed that their salary and service conditions should remain intact as per an implied promise made by the previous administration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that the doctrine of legitimate expectation applied in this case, as they had relied on an express or implied promise made by the previous administration regarding their salary and service conditions. They claimed that the new administration had deviated from a consistent past practice without any reasonable basis. The respondents also contended that the appellant society could not be regarded as a public or government authority for the purposes of this relationship.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the doctrine of legitimate expectation was created to maintain a check on arbitrariness in state action and does not extend to contracts between private parties. The relationship between the administration of the institution and its employees remains contractual, falling within the ambit of private law. The court also noted that there were no past negotiations or dealings between the respondents and the appellant society regarding their salary and service conditions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the doctrine of legitimate expectation would have no applicability to the facts of this case. They found that there was no express or implied promise made by the previous administration, and there were no past negotiations or dealings between the respondents and the appellant society regarding their salary and service conditions. The court also noted that the appellant society could not be regarded as a public or government authority for the purposes of this relationship. As a result, they allowed the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a husband who is accused of murdering his wife. The offense took place inside the four walls of their house, where the deceased and their 7-year-old daughter were living. The respondent-accused has not disputed his presence in the house at the time of the alleged incident. The prosecution presented various incriminating circumstances, including the dubious conduct of the respondent-accused in fleeing away from home leaving behind his minor daughter all alone.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the respondent-accused has failed to explain any of the incriminating circumstances pointing a finger against him. The prosecution relied on Section 106 of the Evidence Act, which shifts the burden on the accused to explain what had actually happened on the day and date his wife died.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the facts presented by the prosecution constitute more than a prima facie case to enable the invocation of Section 106 of the Evidence Act. The court also noted that the respondent-accused maintained complete silence, failing to explain any of the incriminating circumstances.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of acquittal passed by the High Court. The judgment and order of conviction passed by the Trial Court in S.T. No. 197 of 2003 was restored. The respondent-accused was directed to surrender before the Trial Court within a period of four weeks from today to undergo the sentence as imposed by the Trial Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal concerning the summoning of appellants under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The Trial Court had initially rejected their application to be added as accused in the same trial after its conclusion.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given case. However, it can be inferred that the appellants' appeal is based on their right to be heard before being added as an accused under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court pertain to the law applicable in such cases. The court references Maru Ram (supra) and Krishnaji Dattatreya Bapat (supra), stating that although a summoning order may come after the trial's conclusion, it would be deemed to have been passed at the time of the original rejection under Section 319.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court dismisses the appeal. The court directs the Trial Court to take necessary steps in furtherance of the summoning order dated 21.02.2024, ensuring that the appellants are produced before the court to face the trial. The pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over a compulsory acquisition of land by the State. The State had acquired the land for a public purpose, but the owners of the land claimed that the acquisition was not for a public purpose and that they were not paid adequate compensation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (owners of the land) argued that the compulsory acquisition of their land was not for a public purpose, as stated by the State. They also argued that the compensation paid to them was inadequate and did not meet the requirements of Article 300-A of the Constitution.
The respondents (State) argued that the acquisition of the land was indeed for a public purpose and that they had paid fair compensation to the owners of the land in accordance with the law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Division Bench of the High Court committed an egregious error in interfering with the well-reasoned judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court. The court noted that there was no good reason for the Division Bench to interfere with the judgment of the Single Judge.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the compulsory acquisition of land by the State must be measured against the constitutional net as a whole, and not just one or many of its strands. The court set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and affirmed and restored the judgment of the learned Single Judge.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCTS>
The case pertains to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Vellore District Environment Monitoring Committee (VDEMC) in relation to environmental pollution in the Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, India. The PIL was initially filed in 2008 and was later joined by other intervenors.
</Functs>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved include:

*   The VDEMC argued that the leather industry in the Vellore district was causing significant environmental pollution due to the use of hazardous chemicals, improper disposal of waste, and other unsustainable practices. They sought a court order to shut down the polluting units.
*   The AISHTMA (Associated Industrial & Shelters for Technical and Management Activities) argued that their units were not responsible for the pollution and that the allegations made by the VDEMC were baseless.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

*   The court noted that the leather industry was a significant contributor to the economy of the district but also acknowledged that it had severe environmental implications if not managed properly.
*   The court observed that the government and regulatory agencies had failed to take adequate measures to control pollution from the industry.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court includes:

*   The court modified its earlier order passed in WP Nos. 8335 of 2008 and 19017 of 2009, disposing of the appeals filed by the VDEMC.
*   The court upheld the order passed by the High Court in WP No. 22683 of 2009, confirming the award dated 24.08.2009 passed by the LoEA (Local Commissioner for Enquiry). 
*   The court dismissed the appeal filed by AISHTMA.
*   The court issued a range of directions to the state government and regulatory agencies to improve environmental governance in the district, including the establishment of a monitoring committee, improvement in waste management practices, promotion of eco-friendly technologies, and other measures.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the registration of a sale deed and the specific performance of an agreement for sale. The plaintiff (respondent) entered into an agreement for sale on January 24, 2007, but was unable to register the sale deed due to a ban imposed by the Government Order dated August 8, 1986. The plaintiff claimed that the ban was set aside by the court in its decisions dated March 5, 2008, and March 25, 2008. The defendant (appellant) registered a subsequent sale deed on January 24, 2008.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff argued that the bar under Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) would not apply to the second suit because the cause of action was distinct from the first suit. The plaintiff claimed that the decisions dated March 5, 2008, and March 25, 2008, which set aside the ban, were crucial in saving the second suit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court held that the bar under Order II Rule 2 would not be applicable to the facts of the case. The court noted that the decisions dated March 5, 2008, and March 25, 2008, which set aside the ban, were crucial in saving the second suit. However, the court also observed that the plaintiff could have prayed for the reliefs claimed in the subsequent suit at an earlier stage.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the bar under the provisions of Order II Rule 2 CPC would not stand in the way of the institution of the second suit by the respondent. The court directed the Trial Court to decide both suits together on their own merits and in accordance with law, within a period of six months. The appeals preferred against the decision of the High Court were dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the conviction of an appellant for various offenses. The prosecution's evidence included the recovery of a trolley bag from PW-24, which was allegedly linked to the crimes committed by the accused. Additionally, the prosecution presented evidence regarding the retention of an ID card belonging to the deceased EA by the accused and his sister.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned counsel for the appellant pointed out several infirmities in the prosecution's case, including:
- The recovery of the trolley bag from PW-24 was not sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused.
- The ID card belonging to EA should have been retained by the accused immediately after the incident, and its retention for nearly two months is unnatural.
- None of the items recovered were linked to the accused.
- PW-5 was an unreliable witness who had acted as a Panch witness before and knew PW-38.
The prosecution failed to answer these infirmities, leading to a conclusion that there are gaping holes in their story.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The circumstances adduced by the prosecution do not lead to the sole hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. The chain of evidence is incomplete and leaves reasonable grounds for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused. The test of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (Supra) was not satisfied.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 20.12.2018, and acquitted the appellant with regard to the offenses for which he was charged. The appellant shall be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court has decided to constitute a three-judge bench to oversee an inquiry into the matter. The bench will also set up a Task Force to investigate the causes behind student suicides and suggest measures for preventing such incidents in the future.
The Task Force will be headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court and will comprise experts from various fields, including education, psychology, and law. The Task Force will have to submit its interim report within four months and a final report within eight months from the date of the order.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court has directed the Union Government, state governments, and other concerned authorities to extend full cooperation to the Task Force and provide it with all necessary data, information, and assistance. The Ministry of Education will be responsible for providing logistical support to the Task Force, including making arrangements for travel, accommodation, and secretarial assistance.
The court has also directed that an amount of Rupees Twenty Lacs (Rs 20,00,000/-) be deposited with the Registry within two weeks from the date of the order as an outlay for the initial operations of the Task Force. The amicus curiae can move an application seeking orders for disbursement of any additional funds whenever necessary.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiff filed a suit (Special Civil Suit No.133 of 2009) against the defendants, claiming that the compromise decrees passed in Spl. Civil Suit Nos.l52/1951 and 1622/1988 and Civil Appeal No.787/2001, Pune are void ab initio, null and void. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had played a fraud on them by obtaining these compromise decrees. However, the plaint averments were vague and general, and no specific case of fraud could be made out.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff's main argument was that the compromise decrees are void ab initio due to alleged fraud played by the defendants. However, the court observed that this plea of fraud had been raised only to overcome the period of limitation. The plaintiff also relied on Order XXIII Rule 3A of CPC, which bars a third party from seeking a declaration that a compromise decree is void.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the plaint averments were glaringly deficient in establishing any claim against the defendants. The alleged cause of action was found to be creation of fiction, and the plaintiff's predecessors had not taken any steps to assert their title and rights in time. The court also noted that the trial Court had erroneously dismissed the application filed by the appellants under Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the orders passed by the Courts below, including the order dismissing the application under Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC. The court held that the plaint was liable to be rejected at the threshold due to its glaring deficiency in establishing any claim against the defendants. The court also observed that the trial Court should have exercised its discretion under Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC and rejected the plaint.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent unconditionally withdrew the first Arbitration Petition. The respondent then filed a fresh application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996. The High Court of Bombay allowed the fresh application.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the fresh application was not maintainable since no liberty was granted at the time of withdrawal of the first application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996. 
The respondent relied on paragraph 35 of the judgment to argue that they were entitled to file a fresh application.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the reliance on paragraph 35 was incorrect and that it only gave liberty to avail remedies available in law.
The court also noted that instances abound where observations of the court reserving liberty have been misused by litigants, highlighting the importance of careful wording in such situations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the fresh application filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 was not maintainable. It was also time-barred and not entitled to the benefit of Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act or condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
The appeal filed by the appellant was allowed, and the impugned order passed by the High Court of Bombay was set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the validity of certain rules governing the selection process for District and Civil Judges in the states of Bihar and Gujarat. The rules prescribe minimum qualifying marks for interview, which has been challenged as being violative of earlier judgments.
The High Court of Bihar had implemented the Bihar Rules, 1951, which included Clause 11 prescribing a minimum mark for interview. Similarly, the High Court of Gujarat had framed the Gujarat Rules, 2005 (as amended in 2011), under Rule 8(3) which also prescribes a minimum mark for interview.
The petitioners challenged these rules, arguing that they are violative of earlier judgments such as All India Judges (2002).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the petitioners argued that the minimum qualifying marks for interview prescribed in the Bihar and Gujarat Rules are violative of earlier judgments such as All India Judges (2002).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Court observed that moderation of marks is permissible when there is a bonafide reason, such as non-availability of candidates. The Court also noted that transparency in the selection process can be ensured by setting out processes like moderation in the Rules.
The Hon'ble Court further observed that providing a basic outline of the syllabus for the proposed test would help candidates from diverse backgrounds to plan and prepare for the examination even before the notification is released.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court held that the prescription of minimum qualifying marks for interview is permissible and not violative of All India Judges (2002).
The Court upheld the validity of Clause 11 of the Bihar Rules, 1951, and Rule 8(3) of the Gujarat Rules, 2005 (as amended in 2011), which prescribe minimum marks for interview.
The non-consultation with the Public Service Commission would not render the Gujarat Rules, 2005 (as amended in 2011) void.
The Court dismissed the writ petitions without any order on cost.

The case deals with a Mega Power Project and the applicability of certain benefits to the project. The Ministry of Power granted Mega Power Status to the project on 30.07.2010, making it eligible for various benefits. However, the decision was announced on 01.10.2009, and notifications were issued by the concerned Ministries on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the press release of 01.10.2009 was a change in law and that the benefits should be applicable from that date. Several judgments were cited, including Bachhittar Singh vs. The State of Punjab, to contend that the press release was not an "order".
</ARGUMENTS>

<ARGUMENTS CONTINUED>
The respondent argued that the press release of 01.10.2009 was not a change in law and that the benefits should only be applicable from the date of grant of Mega Power Status on 30.07.2010.
</ARGUMENTS CONTINUED>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The State Commission held that the benefits, if any, accruing to the project would be applicable only from 30.07.2010 and not from any prior date. This decision was based on the grant of Mega Power Status by the Ministry of Power.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court affirmed the concurrent judgments of the courts below, dismissing the Civil Appeal with no order as to costs. The Court held that the press release of 01.10.2009 was not a change in law and that the benefits should only be applicable from 30.07.2010.

The case involves the release of balance FSI/TDR to the appellants in light of the judgments of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I. The Bombay High Court had dismissed the writ petitions on the ground of delay and laches, but this decision was set aside by the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented include:
* The respondent-Mumbai Municipal Corporation did not establish that they were prejudiced by any delay in representation or request for FSI/TDR.
* The doctrine of delay and laches does not apply in cases where relief in the nature of compensation is sought, as determined in the judgments of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I.
* The calculation of period of delay submitted by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation is not acceptable due to uncertainty in law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made include:
* Delay has occurred on the part of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation in complying with Regulations regarding FSI/TDR.
* Neither the doctrine of delay and laches nor the principle of abandonment of claim or waiver would apply in these cases.
* The decisions referred to by the Court indicate that the delay has occurred due to uncertainty in law, not on the part of the appellants.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
* Those portions of the impugned order dated 18.12.2018 by which the writ petitions were dismissed on the ground of delay and laches are set aside.
* The respondent Mumbai Municipal Corporation is directed to consider the case of those writ petitioners/appellants herein in light of the judgments of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I and release the balance FSI/TDR to the appellants.

The petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was filed by a party to challenge an arbitral award. The petition was dismissed by the High Court as barred by limitation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the petitioner argued against the dismissal of their petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by Justice Pankaj Mithal include:
- The deviation from the prescribed period of limitation as per the Schedule of the Limitation Act in new enactments is a common trend.
- Statutes often provide their own period of limitation, which may be different from the one prescribed by the Limitation Act.
- This creates confusion and even lawyers may fail to notice the different period of limitation prescribed for preferring an appeal under a particular statute.
- The condonable period of delay should not be restricted to a fixed period, but rather the court should have the discretion to condone the delay if sufficient cause is shown.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by Justice Pankaj Mithal states that:
- The petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was dismissed as barred by limitation.
- The delay in challenging the arbitral award could not be condoned beyond the period of limitation prescribed.
- The observation made by Justice Pankaj Mithal suggests that the legislature should follow the principle of condoning delay as enshrined under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, which would bring about uniformity in law.

The case revolves around the issue of whether broken period interest on securities held by banks is capital expenditure or revenue expenditure. The facts are as follows:
- There were multiple cases (Civil Appeal Nos. 3291 to 3294 of 2009, and other related appeals) filed by the Revenue against various banks.
- The main issue was whether the broken period interest on securities held by banks should be considered as capital expenditure or revenue expenditure.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:
- The Revenue argued that the increase in capital resulting from the purchase of securities helps to expand the bank's capital base, which in turn aids in profit-making. Therefore, they contended that the broken period interest was capital expenditure.
- The banks and their respective tribunals argued that the broken period interest should be treated as revenue expenditure.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
- The court noted that in cases where securities were held as stock-in-trade, the broken period interest was considered as revenue expenditure.
- The court observed that there was no clear distinction between capital and revenue expenditure in the case of broken period interest on securities.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:
- The court ultimately ruled in favor of the banks, holding that the broken period interest on securities held by them should be treated as revenue expenditure.

The appellant has objections to a settlement agreement worth Rs 158 crore between the respondent company and its creditors. The settlement was approved by the CoC, but the appellant objects to it on several grounds. The case is pending in various forums, including the Delaware Court and investigation by authorities like the Enforcement Directorate.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the appellant's objections to the settlement agreement were raised before the NCLAT, which led to the impugned judgment being set aside by the Supreme Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The NCLT did not follow the correct procedure in approving the settlement agreement.
* Regulation 30A of the CIRP Regulations provides a complete mechanism for dealing with applications filed under it, and the approval of a 90% voting share of the CoC is not required if the application for withdrawal is moved before the constitution of the CoC.
* The court set aside the impugned judgment of the NCLAT, allowing the present appeal.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves land acquisition proceedings initiated by the State and KIADB for a project. The appellants (landowners) filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the delay in determining the compensation and payment of the same. The Division Bench of the High Court passed an order, which was challenged by the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the inordinate delay in paying the compensation and thereby depriving their constitutional right under Article 300-A would lead to quashing of the land acquisition proceedings if they were to be quashed. They requested the Court to direct the SLAO to determine the compensation based on the market value prevailing as on 22nd April 2019.
Respondent Nos.6 and 7 argued that they cannot be imposed with a liability for this huge additional expenditure, as the delay in determination of compensation and payment was not attributable to them but was due to the inaction of the State and KIADB.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that if the land acquisition proceedings were to be quashed, the only recourse available to the State/KIADB would be to issue a fresh acquisition notification by invoking the provisions under the 2013 LA Act, which would entail huge expenditure to the public exchequer.
The Court also noted that Respondent Nos.6 and 7 will be at liberty to take recourse to such remedies as are available to them in law for redressal of their inter se dispute.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court disposed of the appeal in the following terms:
(i) The judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court dated 22nd November 2022 in Writ Appeal No. 678 of 2022 (LA-KIADB) is quashed and set aside.
(ii) The writ petition filed by the appellants before the High Court being W.P. No. 1627 of 2021 is allowed.
(iii) The SLAO shall pass a fresh award taking the market value prevailing as on 22nd April 2019 within a period of two months from today after hearing the parties.
(iv) The appellants herein shall be entitled to all statutory benefits as are available to them in law.
(v) The rights of parties to challenge the award in reference, if they are aggrieved by it, shall remain open.
(vi) As the Court has not expressed its opinion on the claims, if any, of Respondent Nos.6 and 7 against the State/KIADB qua the delay in passing the award by the SLAO, Respondent Nos. 6 and 7 are at liberty to take such steps as are permissible in law.

<FACTS>
Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with a case. He filed an appeal against the arrest in the Supreme Court.
The High Court had passed an order allowing the CBI to question Kejriwal in connection with the FIR registered by them.
Kejriwal's counsel argued that the High Court's order was illegal and prayed for a stay on further proceedings against him.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by Kejriwal's counsel were:
* The CBI had no jurisdiction to investigate the matter, as it was beyond their territorial limits.
* The FIR registered by the CBI was not valid, as it did not comply with the requirements of Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
* The High Court's order allowing the CBI to question Kejriwal was arbitrary and without jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that:
* The CBI had obtained permission from the competent authority to investigate the matter, which was a valid exercise of their powers.
* The FIR registered by the CBI was not defective, as it contained all the necessary details required under Section 154 CrPC.
* The High Court's order allowing the CBI to question Kejriwal was within their jurisdiction and did not suffer from any infirmity.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by Kejriwal, setting aside the High Court's order. The court held that:
* The CBI had valid jurisdiction to investigate the matter, as it was within their territorial limits.
* The FIR registered by the CBI was valid and not defective.
* Kejriwal was entitled to be released on bail, subject to certain conditions.
The court imposed the following conditions for Kejriwal's release:
	+ He is to furnish bail bonds for a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/- with two sureties of such like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.
	+ He shall not make any public comments on the merits of the CBI case, which is sub judice before the Trial Court.
	+ However, this condition does not preclude him from raising all his contentions before the Trial Court.
	+ The terms and conditions imposed by a coordinate bench of the Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No. 2493/2024 are to be mutatis mutandis applied in the present case.
	+ He shall remain present before the Trial Court on each and every date of hearing, unless granted exemption.
	+ He shall fully cooperate with the Trial Court for expeditious conclusion of the trial proceedings.

The petitioner, a member of the BLC (Bihar Legislative Council), was expelled from the House after being found guilty of misconduct. The petitioner challenged the expulsion in court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's arguments included:
* The Constitutional Courts have jurisdiction to review the validity of actions taken by the House and examine the proportionality of punishment imposed on a Member.
* The punishment meted out to the petitioner was excessive and disproportionate to the nature of the misconduct committed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court:
* The period of expulsion already undergone by the petitioner shall be deemed as a period of suspension from the House, and will amount to sufficient punishment for his misdemeanour.
* The Impugned Report of the Ethics Committee and the Notification of the BLC deserve to be modified to that extent.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment:
* The writ petition is allowed.
* The objection raised by the respondents against the maintainability of the instant petition is rejected.
* The punishment meted out to the petitioner was highly excessive and disproportionate to the nature of the misconduct committed.
* The period of expulsion already undergone by the petitioner shall be deemed as a period of his suspension from the House, and will amount to sufficient punishment for his misdemeanour. Accordingly, the Impugned Report of the Ethics Committee as well as the Notification of the BLC is set aside only to the extent of nature of punishment it recommends to be imposed on the petitioner.
* The petitioner is directed to be reinstated as a member of the BLC with immediate effect. However, he shall not be entitled to claim any remuneration or other monetary benefits for the period of his disbandment.
* Any action taken pursuant to the Press Note dated 30.12.2024 issued by Respondent No. 6, Election Commission, declaring the bye-election for the seat earlier held by the petitioner is hereby annulled.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves custodial torture and death of a person named Shama @ Kalya. The police had allegedly staged a performance to support their version that Shama had escaped from their custody. A conviction was earlier confirmed by the High Court under Section 304 Part-II IPC read with Section 34 IPC, but the appellants were let off rather lightly.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that sufficient evidence was adduced to prove custodial torture by the police and therefore, it was for the police themselves to prove their innocence. The defense argued that in the absence of evidence regarding the homicidal death of Shama @ Kalya, the appellants were entitled to be acquitted of the charge under Section 304 Part-II IPC read with Section 34 IPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the police had a history of custodial torture and deaths. The National Police Commission had recommended mandatory judicial inquiry by a District and Sessions Judge, but this recommendation remained on paper. The Law Commission of India had recommended insertion of Section 114-B in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 to reverse the burden of proof in cases of custodial death onto the police themselves.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court maintained the convictions and sentences of the appellants as confirmed by the High Court. The judges ruled that giving in to their duplicitous stories and permitting them to escape punishment would only add insult to injury. They stated that they would respectfully disagree with the conclusion drawn by their learned brother that, in the absence of evidence regarding the homicidal death of Shama @ Kalya, the appellants were entitled to be acquitted.

<FACTS>
The case involves appeals related to the payment of royalty and dead rent by respondents in various mines located within the state. The respondents had paid Re.1 per square foot as royalty, but the State government demanded higher amounts based on new rates.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments made by the parties were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it is clear that the appeals pertain to disputes over the amount of royalty and dead rent owed by respondents in mines within the state.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the respondents had paid Re.1 per square foot as royalty but were subsequently asked to pay higher amounts based on new rates. The court also observed that there was a conceptual difference between royalty and tax, with royalty being a contractual consideration for parting with mineral rights.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court states that both royalty and dead rent do not fulfill the characteristics of tax or impost. It further concludes that royalty is not a tax but rather a contractual consideration paid by mining lessees to lessors for enjoying mineral rights. The payments made to the government cannot be deemed as tax merely because the statute provides for their recovery as arrears.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Khalsa University was established in 2016, and the appellants filed a writ petition challenging its validity. The main contention of the appellants was that the establishment of the university would shadow and damage the character and pristine glory of the Khalsa College, which has become a significant icon of Khalsa heritage over time.
The appellants also gave a specific undertaking stating that the majestic façade and visual appeal of the building of the Khalsa College have not been touched or adversely affected by the establishment of the Khalsa University in any way whatsoever. 
The maps placed on record show that it is only the Khalsa College established in 1892 which is a heritage one, while all other buildings were subsequently constructed having no resemblance with the Khalsa College building.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument of the appellants was based on the concept of manifest arbitrariness under Article 14 of the Constitution. They contended that the purpose for enacting the Impugned Act, i.e., to establish the Khalsa University, is non-existent as it would not affect the Khalsa College in any way.
The appellants also relied on the judgment in <i>Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India</i>, which held that if a legislation is based on a non-existent purpose, it would be violative of Article 14.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include the fact that the Khalsa College and the Khalsa University are two separate institutions, and the establishment of the university would not affect the college in any way.
The court also noted that the appellants had given a specific undertaking stating that the Khalsa College would not be affiliated with the Khalsa University, which was reiterated during the course of hearing.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the Impugned Act, which was enacted on a non-existent basis, falls under the ambit of manifest arbitrariness and is therefore violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
The court allowed the appeal and quashed and set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court. The writ petition was also allowed, and the Khalsa University (Repeal) Act, 2017, was struck down as being unconstitutional.
The consequent direction was issued to the effect that the Khalsa University Act, 2016, would be deemed to be in force, and status quo as it obtained on 29th May 2017 would stand restored.

The case involves an alleged offense under Section 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The High Court had rejected the petitioner's bail plea on March 22, 2024.

</Facts>

<Arguments>

* The court noted that the petitioner has been in custody for a significant period and has cooperated with the investigation.
* The court observed that there is no evidence to suggest that the petitioner would flee or tamper with evidence if released on bail.
* The court also considered the fact that the petitioner's family members have given guarantees for his attendance before the trial court.

</Observations>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case deals with the interpretation of provisions under a specific Act, particularly concerning the application and precedents related to it. The Hon'ble Supreme Court is considering a three-judge Bench to resolve the matter due to the complexity and need for clarity in the subject.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments were presented regarding the binding nature of previous judgments (Silpi Industries vs. Union of India and Mahakali Foods Pvt Ltd. vs. Union of India) and subsequent orders (Vaishno Enterprises vs. Union of India and M/s Nitesh Estates vs. Union of India). It was also noted that not all decisions made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court are intended to be binding precedents.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations were made about the twin functions performed by the Supreme Court: decision-making and precedent-making. The Court acknowledged the difficulty faced by High Courts and subordinate courts in determining whether a judgment is for decision-making or precedent-making. It was also noted that even obiter dicta (statements in a judgment that are not essential to the decision) of the Supreme Court must be treated as binding precedents for lower courts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court decided to refer the appeal to a three-judge Bench due to the compelling need to ensure clarity and certainty about applicable precedents on the subject. This decision was made despite having arrived at an opinion through interpretation of the provisions under the Act.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) against Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on behalf of various credit card holders. The complaint alleged that RBI had failed to regulate the interest rates charged by banks, which resulted in exorbitant charges being levied on credit card holders.
The complainants argued that RBI's policy directives and circulars issued under the Banking Regulation Act were not being followed by banks, leading to unfair practices and high interest rates.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The RBI argued that it had issued guidelines and circulars to regulate the interest rates charged by banks but these were not binding on individual banks. The RBI also stated that credit card holders were aware of the terms and conditions of their credit cards, including the interest rates, when they applied for them.
The National Commission (NCDRC) held that RBI was responsible for ensuring that banking regulations were followed by all banks in India. They argued that RBI's policy directives and circulars issued under the Banking Regulation Act were being disregarded by banks, leading to unfair practices and high interest rates.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The National Commission observed that while RBI had issued guidelines and circulars to regulate interest rates, these were not being enforced effectively. They also noted that credit card holders were not aware of the interest rates when they applied for their cards, as they were not clearly disclosed by banks.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by RBI and set aside the final judgment/order passed by the National Commission (NCDRC) on 07.07.2008 in "Awaz & Ors. Vs Reserve Bank of India". The court held that RBI was not responsible for regulating interest rates charged by individual banks, as this was a matter for each bank to decide. The court also noted that credit card holders were aware of the terms and conditions of their credit cards, including the interest rates, when they applied for them.
The Supreme Court concluded that there was no material on record to establish that RBI had acted contrary to policy directives issued by it. They further stated that there was no evidence to show that charging rates of interest without a standardized rate was usurious and constituted an unfair trade practice.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court granted bail to the respondent on a technical ground that Section 52A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was not complied with. The respondent had challenged the seizure of contraband.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the grant of bail by the High Court was based solely on a procedural technicality, without considering the merits of the case or the provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. They contended that the respondent's application for bail should be considered afresh on its merits and in accordance with law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that while compliance with Section 52A is mandatory, non-compliance does not automatically entitle an accused to be released on bail. The court noted that the purpose of inserting Section 52A was to ensure early disposal of seized contraband, and any lapse or delay in compliance would be merely a procedural irregularity.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order granting bail to the respondent. The court remanded the matter to the High Court for deciding the bail application afresh on merits and in accordance with law, within four weeks.

The case involves the detention of Appisseril Kochu Mohammed Shaji (Shaji A.K.) under COFEPOSA. The detenu had made representations to the authorities, which were not decided within a reasonable period.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the detenu's counsel argued that the delay in deciding his representation was unreasonable and violated his right under Article 22(5) of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court include:
* The Prison Authorities' casual, callous, and negligent approach in ensuring that the representations were communicated to the Competent Authorities within a reasonable period.
* The delay of almost 9 months in deciding the representation, which was unreasonable and violated the detenu's right under Article 22(5) of the Constitution.
* The need for the Prison Authorities to ensure that representations are sent to the Competent Authorities immediately after receipt, and for the Competent Authority to decide such representations with utmost expedition.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the judgment and order of the High Court dated 4th March 2024 in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 1271 of 2023, the order dated 31st August 2023 passed by the Joint Secretary (COFEPOSA) to the Government of India directing the detention of the detenu, and the order dated 28th November 2023 passed by the Under Secretary, Government of India confirming the detention order of the detenu.

<FACTS>
The Appellant, a juvenile, was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment. He has been serving his sentence for almost 25 years. The Appellant's plea of juvenility was raised, but it was not properly dealt with by the Courts. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant's lawyers argued that the plea of juvenility should have been dealt with under the existing laws at the relevant point of time, especially when there exists a tacit and clear admission as to the age of the Appellant.
The lawyers also argued that this Court could have dealt with the Writ Petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, which raised an independent prayer for the enforcement of a right conferred under a social welfare legislation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed by the Court that the Appellant has been suffering due to the error committed by the Courts. He lost an opportunity to reintegrate into society and the time he has lost can never be restored.
The Court also noted that the society has undergone significant transformation during the Appellant's imprisonment, which he might be unaware of and find difficult to adjust with.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the Appeal and set aside the sentence imposed in excess of the upper limit prescribed under the relevant Act. The conviction was maintained, but the Appellant was released forthwith if not required in any other case.
The Uttarakhand State Legal Services Authority was directed to play a proactive role in identifying any welfare scheme of the State/Central Government and facilitating the Appellant's rehabilitation and smooth reintegration into society upon his release.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves arbitration agreements and the constitution of an independent and impartial tribunal. The parties to the agreement have chosen arbitration over ordinary civil proceedings for dispute resolution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Party autonomy in making of an arbitration agreement is an essential feature of arbitration, but it must comply with statutory obligations to establish an independent and impartial tribunal. The court has the power to ensure that the arbitration agreement inspires confidence and enables establishment of an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal. Arbitration agreements enabling one party to unilaterally constitute the arbitral tribunal do not inspire confidence of independence and may violate public policy requirements.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judge recognizes two interdependent principles in dispute resolution through arbitration: contractual freedom as party autonomy and statutory obligation as duty to constitute an independent arbitral tribunal. The judge also notes that party autonomy is sufficiently incorporated in the Arbitration Act, along with a restraint on judicial intervention.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
I. Dispute resolution through arbitration encompasses two independent yet interdependent principles: contractual freedom as party autonomy and statutory obligation as duty to constitute an independent arbitral tribunal.

II. Party autonomy in making of an arbitration agreement is an essential feature of arbitration. It commences with choosing the members of the arbitral tribunal, extends to the procedure that would apply for its conduct, and concludes with the method by which an award could be challenged before a court.

III. The moment parties choose arbitration over ordinary civil proceedings for dispute resolution, their duty to establish an independent and impartial tribunal arises.

IV. If an arbitration agreement is considered by the court as not enabling constitution of an independent and impartial tribunal, any submission that the said agreement is a binding contract or it is in exercise of party autonomy is not tenable as such an agreement will be against public policy and as such not an enforceable contract.

V. The power to ensure that the arbitration agreement is compliant with the public policy requirement of establishing an independent and impartial tribunal is always of the Court.

VI. The court will scrutinise the agreement and hold them to be invalid if it considers it appropriate.

VII. The occasion for the court to examine the constitution of the independent and impartial tribunal under the arbitration clause will arise when one of the parties makes an application under Sections 11, 14 or 34.

IX. All applications pending before the courts challenging the unilateral appointment clauses will be disposed of applying the test as to whether such a clause enables establishment of an independent and impartial tribunal.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The complainant issued a cheque to the accused for an amount of Rs 7,00,000/- which was returned due to insufficiency of funds. The complainant sent a statutory notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1981 to the accused, but he did not respond. The complainant then initiated proceedings against the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1981.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court observed that the provision under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1981 exposes the person who has drawn the cheque and which has been returned for insufficiency of funds to criminal liability. The provision must be construed strictly, but such a strict construction should not result in defeating the very purpose for which the provision has been enacted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the peculiar factual situation of the present case and the plight of the complainant is not lost upon them. They are conscious of the fact that the option of bringing civil action against the accused or the hospital will be of no avail to the complainant as the claims are hopelessly time barred.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that although it is not possible to hold the accused liable for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1981, yet the possibility of him having committed the offence of cheating cannot be ruled out. Prima facie, the mens rea (guilty mind) of the accused speaks for itself. The court left it open to the complainant to approach the jurisdictional police station and lodge an appropriate FIR against the accused.

<FACTS>
The case pertains to the imposition and collection of user fees/tolls by Noida Toll Bridge Company Limited (NTBCL) on vehicles passing through the Noida Toll Bridge. The Respondent Welfare Association, on behalf of its members who use the bridge regularly, filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the validity of certain provisions of the Concession Agreement between NTBCL and the State authorities. The petition also sought to restrain the imposition and collection of user fees/tolls.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the Respondent Welfare Association included:
* The contract awarded to NTBCL through the Concession Agreement was unfair, unjust, and inconsistent with Constitutional norms.
* NOIDA exceeded its authority by delegating the power to levy fees or impose tolls to NTBCL, rendering such delegation invalid.
* Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, read with the formula in Annexure F, contravenes public policy and is liable to be severed from the Agreement.
The High Court entertained the writ petition filed by the Respondent Welfare Association, holding that it was maintainable in public interest.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:
* NTBCL has recovered the project costs and substantial profits through the imposition of user fees/tolls, eliminating any justification for continued imposition or collection.
* The issue pertaining to outdoor licensing fees between NOIDA and NTBCL does not fall within the purview of the present challenge.
The court clarified that the matter concerning the challenge to the arbitration proceedings between NOIDA and NTBCL (SLP(C) No. 8060/2019) shall be heard and decided separately on its own merit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment is upheld, and it is held that there is no infirmity in the impugned judgment. The instant appeal is consequently dismissed. The court also directs that NOIDA shall be at liberty to initiate recovery proceedings as per the dispute resolution mechanism outlined in the Delhi Land Lease and Noida Land Lease Agreements.

<FACTS>
The case involves a Criminal Appeal related to the seizure of a vehicle under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The owner of the vehicle, the appellant, is seeking the release of his vehicle on superdari.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant include:
* Section 36-C read with Section 51 of the NDPS Act allows for the application of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in proceedings before a Special Court under the NDPS Act.
* Section 451 of the CrPC has an inbuilt provision to impose specific conditions on the release of seized vehicles.
* The vehicle owner had no knowledge of the alleged transaction and did not participate in the offense.
* Keeping the seized vehicle at the police station for a long period is unnecessary, and it's open to the Magistrate to pass appropriate orders immediately by taking a bond and guarantee as well as security for return of the said vehicle if required at any point of time.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court include:
* Vehicles in police custody are stored in the open, which may cause damage or depreciation in value over time.
* Keeping the vehicle in police custody until the trial is over would serve no purpose and would be wasteful.
* Releasing the vehicle on superdari would benefit the owner, the bank/financier, and society at large by making an additional vehicle available for transportation of goods.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the decision of the Division Bench of the High Court in a matter related to the interpretation of Section 33(1) of the 1996 Act. The respondent had sought clarification from the learned Arbitrator, and the appellant contested this on the grounds that the Arbitrator had become functus officio and lacked jurisdiction to issue the clarification.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:
- Appellant's argument: The learned Arbitrator had become functus officio and lacked jurisdiction to issue the clarification sought by the respondent beyond the initial period of 30 days.
- Respondent's argument: The court had permitted the respondent to seek clarification from the learned Arbitrator, and the appellant fully participated in the clarificatory proceeding.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made during the case:
- The matter had attained finality up to the Apex Court, and the Division Bench of the High Court cannot interfere with the merits of the case at this stage.
- The interpretation given by the court is that Section 33(1) of the 1996 Act covers cases where another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties, which applies in this case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the Division Bench:
- The contention of the appellant that the learned Arbitrator had become functus officio and lacked jurisdiction to issue the clarification cannot be accepted and is thus rejected.
- The court ruled that the sum awarded would mean the principal amount plus the interest awarded from the date of cause of action up to the date of the award. Thereafter, as per Section 31(7)(b) of the 1996 Act, the sum (principal plus interest) would carry interest @ 18% from the date of the award to the date of payment.
- The appeal lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed without any order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute involving the use of a property allocated under the Bombay Town Planning Scheme, 1925. The plaintiff (Respondent No.1) had leased the property for "poorer classes" accommodation with special terms and conditions. However, the plaintiff sought to redirect the property towards commercial exploitation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the arguments may revolve around:

* The interpretation of the Bombay Town Planning Scheme, 1925
* The validity of the plaintiff's attempt to redirect the property towards commercial exploitation
* The breach of lease conditions and statutory obligations by the plaintiff

However, without explicit information, these are mere inferences.

<ARGUMENTS>
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The plaintiff's conduct amounts to an abuse of beneficial legislation.
* Allowing the plaintiff to disregard the obligations would hollow out the protections and advantages established by the statute.
* The property is leased on special terms, with minimal rent and under carefully prescribed conditions, to ensure that the less-privileged receive tangible benefits.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The appeal is allowed.
* The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside.
* The writ petition is dismissed.

The court's reasoning is based on the fact that the plaintiff's conduct threatens to erode the very foundation upon which the original agreement stood, and that the contractual language and statutory purpose are both premised on ensuring that the "demised premises" remain dedicated to providing adequate housing to those otherwise struggling to find decent living conditions in a rapidly expanding metropolis.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiff filed a suit in Special Civil Suit No.133 of 2009, claiming that the compromise decrees passed in Spl. Civil Suit Nos.152/1951 and 1622/1988 and Civil Appeal No.787/2001, Pune are void ab initio, null and void.
The plaintiff alleged that fraud was played on them by the defendants in relation to the compromise decrees obtained in their favor.
The plaintiff claimed that they were strangers to the suits which ended in compromise.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the defendant's (respondent) argument would focus on the limitation period and the bar under Order XXIII Rule 3A of CPC.
The plaintiff's (appellant) argument might have centered around the alleged fraud played on them by the defendants and their claims regarding the compromise decrees being void ab initio.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the plaintiff's suit is hopelessly barred by limitation.
The court noted that the plaintiff did not take any steps to assert their title and rights in time, and the alleged cause of action was found to be a creation of fiction.
The court also observed that the trial Court erroneously dismissed the application filed by the appellants under Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the plaint is liable to be rejected at the threshold, and set aside the orders passed by the Courts below.
The court allowed the application filed by the appellants under Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC, rejecting the plaint in Special Civil Suit No.133 of 2009.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquisition of land for public purpose under the Municipal Corporation Act, 1951. The Government of Himachal Pradesh initiated acquisition proceedings against the Appellant, JAL, and took possession of the Nangli Kota lands without depositing compensation to the respondents. The High Court passed an order declaring the notification under Section 52(1) as invalid on grounds that the compensation was not deposited within the specified timeline and that the acquisition process was not fair and in accordance with law.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant, JAL, argued that the Government of Himachal Pradesh had initiated acquisition proceedings under the MOU signed between itself and JAL. The respondents claimed that the acquisition process was not fair and that the compensation was not deposited within the specified timeline as per Section 60A(4) of the RUI Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the delay in payment of compensation to the landowners after taking away ownership of the subject land from them is a contravention to the spirit of the constitutional scheme of Article 300A and the idea of a welfare State. The Court also noted that the acquisition of land for public purpose under the power of eminent domain of the government must be coupled with a bounden duty and obligation on the part of the government body to ensure that the owners whose lands get acquired are paid compensation/awarded amount as declared by the statutory award at the earliest.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that no error not to speak of any error of law could be said to have been committed by the High Court in passing the impugned order. The appeals were dismissed, and parties were ordered to bear their own costs. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between the 1st respondent-Doha Bank and the appellants regarding their claims under a Debtor-Creditor Agreement (DoH). The DoH contains a clause that prohibits the debtor from making any payments to the creditors until the debt is settled. The NCLT had ruled in favor of the appellants, but the NCLAT later overturned this decision.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:

* The appellants claimed that they were entitled to be treated as secured creditors under the DoH.
* They argued that even if their claims could not be enforced due to the applicability of the moratorium, a right to payment existed and thus they had a valid claim under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
* The appellants also cited the severability clause in the DoH, which states that each provision is distinct from others and that the invalidity of one does not affect the rest.
* They argued that the NCLAT's decision was incorrect and that the DoH should be upheld.

The arguments presented by the 1st respondent-Doha Bank include:

* They claimed that the appellants' claims were barred by the moratorium provision under Section 14 of the IBC, which prohibits any action against the debtor during the insolvency proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Notable observations from the case include:
The NCLAT had initially overturned the NCLT's decision in favor of the appellants, but this ruling was later set aside by the Supreme Court.
The NCLAT observed that the Resolution Plan had been approved subject to the disposal of pending applications, and that if required, the plan would be reconsidered after hearing all parties.

In paragraph 7 of its order, the NCLAT stated that depending on the outcome of the appeals, if the Resolution Plan needed to be reconsidered, the adjudicating authority would do so.
The appellants' alternative contention regarding their status as secured creditors was not addressed in the judgment since their main contention was accepted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately allowed the appeals and set aside the impugned order of the NCLAT. The court upheld the order dated 2nd March 2021 passed by the NCLT, Mumbai Bench (adjudicating authority).

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a suit filed under O.S. No. 25968 of 2018 in the XIII Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Mayohall Unit, Bengaluru. The plaint claimed that Rs. 2,00,000/- and above was paid by cash towards consideration for conveyance of immovable property.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argued that when a suit is filed with a claim that Rs. 2,00,000/- and above is paid by cash towards any transaction, the courts must intimate the same to the jurisdictional Income Tax Department to verify the transaction and the violation of Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that most times such transactions go unnoticed or not brought to the knowledge of the income tax authorities. It was also noted that ignorance in fact is excusable but not the ignorance in law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 02.06.2022 and the order of the trial Court dated 11.06.2021. The application filed under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) CPC was allowed, and the plaint in O.S. No. 25968 of 2018 was rejected.

<FACTS>
The respondent was a claimant who had applied for appointment under the appellant's organization. The respondent was a widow with three children and claimed to be suitable for the job based on her experience and qualifications. However, the MD & CEO of the organization did not consider the respondent suitable for the position and rejected her application.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that she had been unfairly denied appointment by the MD & CEO, citing Canara Bank v. K. Shivashankarappa as a precedent in support of her claim. The respondent also argued that the criterion of suitability was not applied by the Division Bench when directing her appointment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court felt bound by Canara Bank v. K. Shivashankarappa and did not examine the order of the MD & CEO properly. The coordinate bench had observed that it would consider making a direction for payment of a lumpsum amount to the respondent towards full and final settlement.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the civil appeal, setting aside the impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench as well as that of the Single Bench. The court directed the appellant to make a lumpsum payment of Rs.2.5 lakh to the respondent within 2 months from the date, in addition to the earlier payment of Rs.50,000 made by another coordinate bench.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioner filed an arbitration petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The respondent received the notice invoking arbitration on 29.11.2022, which is within the three-year period from the date when the cause of action for the claim had arisen.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's argument was that the claims sought to be raised by them are not ex-facie time-barred or dead claims on the date of commencement of arbitration. They relied on the principle that while considering the issue of limitation in relation to a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, the courts should satisfy themselves on two aspects: whether the petition is barred by limitation and whether the claims sought to be arbitrated are ex-facie dead claims.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the applicability of Section 137 to applications under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is a result of legislative vacuum. The period of three years is an unduly long period for filing an application under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 and goes against the very spirit of the Act, 1996 which provides for expeditious resolution of commercial disputes within a time-bound manner.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the present arbitration petition, holding that it was not hit by limitation. The claims cannot be said to be ex-facie dead or time-barred on the date of commencement of the arbitration proceedings. The court appointed Shri Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Former Judge of the Supreme Court of India, as the sole arbitrator and fixed his fees in consultation with the parties.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plot in question was reserved for a public purpose, and the respondents failed to take steps to issue notification after receiving notice from the landowner. The High Court had passed an order which was challenged by the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants were based on Sections 126 and 127 of the MRTP Act, which provide for the utilization of reserved land within a specified timeline or allow the owner to use the land as per the town planning scheme. The respondents failed to take necessary steps to acquire the land after receiving notice from the landowner.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that when by operation of law, reservation is deemed to have lapsed under Section 127(1) of the MRTP Act, it lapses for all purposes and times to come. This means that no writ of mandamus can be issued by the High Court to direct acquisition of the land or pay compensation to the landowners.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court, and declared that the reservation of the plot could be said to have lapsed by efflux of time in view of the provisions under Sections 126 and 127 of the MRTP Act respectively.
</JUDGMENT>

<FACTS>
The case involves two appeals (SLP C Nos. 13618-13619 of 2020) against the judgments of the High Court, which were passed in a matter related to immovable property and documents required for its transfer.
One of the parties was granted an order of temporary possession of the property, but it did not result in any transfer or sale of the property.
The documents required for transferring the property were not registered, as per Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.
Registration would have provided public notice and protection against frauds and forgeries.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Several key observations are made by the Supreme Court in its judgment:
The documents required to transfer immovable property must be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.
Registration provides public notice and protection against frauds and forgeries, making it a crucial aspect of transactions related to immovable property.
The non-registration of documents does not affect the title or interest in the property but makes it difficult to ascertain the rights and obligations associated with the property.
Registration also facilitates verification and certification of title, reducing disputes and litigations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Based on the above observations and legal framework, the Supreme Court reaches the following conclusion:
The High Court did not commit any error in passing the impugned judgment.
The appeals are dismissed, and parties are to bear their own costs.
Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the validity of certain regulations framed by the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) in relation to open access to electricity distribution. The regulations were challenged by certain captive power generators who alleged that they were arbitrary and unreasonable.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The RERC argued that the regulations were necessary to ensure fair competition among market participants and to prevent practices detrimental to the larger consumer base. They also contended that the regulations were within their statutory powers as granted under Section 86(1)(c) of the Electricity Act, 2003.
The captive power generators, on the other hand, argued that the regulations unfairly restricted their rights and imposed undue burdens on them. They alleged that the RERC had exceeded its statutory powers in framing these regulations.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case highlights the complexities of regulatory frameworks in the electricity sector and the need for balance between competing interests. The court's decision to uphold the validity of the regulations suggests that they are seen as necessary measures to ensure fair competition and prevent unfair practices.
It is also observed that the court has carefully examined the statutory powers granted to the RERC under the Electricity Act, 2003, and has held that these powers were exercised in a manner consistent with the objects of the Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court upheld the validity of the Regulations of 2016 framed by the RERC. The court observed that any inconvenience caused or hardship faced by the captive power generators would not make the regulations illegal. The court also noted that the appellants had failed to establish that the impugned regulations were in contravention of their rights protected under Part-III or any other provision of the Constitution of India, or that the regulations had been enacted without having the competence to do so.
The court's judgment was in consonance with the objects of the Electricity Act, 2003, and has been framed as per the competence available under Section 181 read with Section 42 of the Act.

The respondent claimed that he was the illegitimate son of the appellant, while the appellant denied this claim. The case spans over two decades and involves multiple court proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:
- Legitimacy determines paternity under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, until the presumption is successfully rebutted by proving 'non-access'.
- The Munsiff Court and the Sub-Judge Court possessed jurisdiction to entertain the Original Suit, which dealt with the question of the legitimacy of the respondent.
- The Family Court, Alappuzha erred in reopening the Maintenance Petition when the self-imposed condition was not satisfied.
- The impugned proceedings, initiated by the respondent, are barred by the principle of res judicata.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations from the case:
- The case highlights the importance of the legitimacy of a relationship in determining paternity under Indian law.
- The court's decision emphasizes the need to follow established legal principles and avoid prolonging litigation unnecessarily.
- The respondent's claim was barred by res judicata, as the issue was already settled inter partes in 2011.

- The appeal is allowed in the above terms.
- The impugned judgments of the High Court dated 21.05.2018 and of the Family Court dated 09.11.2015 are set aside.
- Any claim by the respondent based upon the perceived relationship of paternity qua the appellant stands negated.

The case involves a dispute between Inox and another party regarding the ownership of "Proprietary Engineering Drawings" and alleged infringement of intellectual property rights. The Commercial Court had rejected the suit, but the High Court upheld the decision, directing the Commercial Court to conduct trial.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff, Inox, argued that the "Proprietary Engineering Drawings" were an original artistic work, not a design, and therefore protected under the Copyright Act. The defendant argued that the drawings were a design and thus fell under the Designs Act.
The High Court analyzed the precedents and legal positions, stating that this case warrants a trial due to triable issues involved.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the Commercial Court misread the plaint, misapplied legal principles, and overlooked the distinction between "artistic work" and "design."
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Judges upheld the decision of the High Court, dismissing the instant appeals with the following conclusions and directions:
i. The decision of the High Court rejecting the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC is upheld;
ii. The Commercial Court is directed to deliver its decision on the pending application seeking interim injunction preferred by Inox, within a period of two months;

The court buildings mentioned include Heritage Court buildings such as Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, etc.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court of India observed that the existing toilet facilities in court premises are inadequate and unhygienic. The court noted that many people with disabilities face difficulties in accessing these toilets due to lack of ramps, inaccessible doors, and inadequate plumbing systems. The court also expressed concern about the lack of separate washrooms for women, transgender persons, and nursing mothers.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court of India directed the State Governments / UTs to allocate sufficient funds for the construction, maintenance, and cleanliness of toilet facilities within the court premises. The court also constituted a committee in each High Court to oversee the implementation of the directives. The committee is responsible for ensuring that the toilet facilities are improved, accessible, and hygienic.

The specific directives issued by the court include:

1. Providing clear signage and indications along with functional amenities such as water, electricity, operational flushes, provision of hand soap, napkins, toilet paper, and up-to-date plumbing systems.
2. Installing ramps in PwD washrooms to ensure accessibility.
3. Effectuating a mandatory cleaning schedule and ensuring staffing for maintenance and upkeep.
4. Ensuring regular maintenance of toilets by outsourcing professional agencies on contract basis.
5. Putting in place a mechanism that mandates the periodic inspection of the functionality of these washrooms and specific compliance reports to be filed to a person-in-charge.
6. Framing a complaint / redressal system for speedy reporting of defective washrooms and instant repair of the same.
7. Ensuring that there are working and stocked sanitary pad dispensers in women, PwD, and transgender washrooms.
8. Nominating or appointing a nodal officer to monitor maintenance, address complaints, and communicate with the presiding officer or the appropriate committee.
9. Creating a separate monetary fund for the construction and maintenance of toilets in court complexes.

The case involves a Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) who was expelled from the council for misconduct. The MLC filed a writ petition challenging the expulsion and seeking reinstatement.
The respondent is the Election Commission, which had declared a bye-election for the seat earlier held by the petitioner.
The petitioner's conduct was deemed to be in contravention of the rules and regulations of the Legislative Council.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the expulsion was arbitrary and not based on any valid reason. They claimed that the action taken by the House was excessive and disproportionate to the nature of the misconduct committed.
The respondents argued that the House had the power to expel members for misconduct, and that the decision was taken in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Legislative Council.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that while the Constitutional Courts have restrictions on examining matters related to the proceedings of Parliament, they can still examine the proportionality of the punishment imposed on a Member.
The court noted that the punishment meted out to the petitioner was highly excessive and disproportionate to the nature of the misconduct committed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the writ petition in part. It set aside the Impugned Report of the Ethics Committee as well as the Notification of the Legislative Council, only to the extent of the nature of punishment it recommends to be imposed on the petitioner.
The court directed the petitioner to be reinstated as a member of the Legislative Council with immediate effect. However, the petitioner shall not be entitled to claim any remuneration or other monetary benefits for the period of their disbandment.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals and writ petitions filed by appellants/petitioners seeking to stay prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The appeals are based on the interim moratorium under Section 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The applicants claim that the moratorium should bar or prohibit the continuation of proceedings under Section 138.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants/petitioners include:

*   The moratorium under Section 96 IBC operates as a bar to all actions and proceedings against the corporate debtor, including criminal prosecutions under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
*   The decisions relied on by the High Court dealt with the proceedings under section 14 IBC and not the proceedings under section 96 IBC, which is relevant in this case.
*   The appellants/petitioners sought to stay the prosecution under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881, relying on the interim moratorium under Section 96 IBC.

The court, however, rejected these arguments and held that the object of the moratorium is not to stall criminal prosecutions but only to postpone civil actions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

*   The deterrent effect of Section 138 is critical to maintain trust in the use of negotiable instruments like cheques in business dealings.
*   Allowing the appellants/petitioners to evade prosecution under Section 138 would undermine the very purpose of the N.I. Act, 1881.
*   The personal responsibility persists regardless of insolvency proceedings and their outcome.

The court also noted that the provision enabling the debtor to approach the Tribunal under Section 94 is not meant to stall criminal prosecutions but only to postpone civil actions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

*   The prayer of the appellants/petitioners to stay the prosecution under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881, relying on the interim moratorium under Section 96 IBC, cannot be entertained.
*   Therefore, the judgments/orders passed by the different High Courts affirming the orders of the trial court need not be interfered with.

All criminal appeals and writ petitions are dismissed, and pending applications stand closed.

The Special Court had issued bailable warrants against the respondents, but they kept avoiding its execution. Despite this, the High Court granted anticipatory bail to the respondents.
The Special Court then initiated proclamation proceedings under Section 82 of the Code for requiring the respondents to appear before it.
The High Court's orders granting anticipatory bail were challenged by the appeals filed in the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court argued that the High Court's orders granting anticipatory bail were perverse and untenable at law, as they ignored the well-settled legal position and the proceedings conducted by the Special Court against the respondents.
The court also noted that the respondents had been avoiding the execution of bailable warrants and did not appear before the Special Court despite being aware of the pendency of complaint proceedings against them.
</ARGUMENTS>

- The petition was filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
- The condonable period of 30 days stipulated under the proviso to Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 had also lapsed.
- The delay in challenging the award could not be condoned beyond the prescribed period.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judges observed that:
- Practically all new/recent enactments are deviating from the prescribed period of limitation as per the Schedule of the Limitation Act and prescribing their own period of limitation.
- Statutes further provide that delay beyond a certain period cannot be condoned by the court, which is in deviation to what is prescribed by Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the Cinematograph Act and Rules regarding the portrayal of persons with disabilities in visual media. The Appellants had submitted that the Act was inadequate in regulating the depiction of disabilities and sought directions for implementation of measures to encourage respectful and accurate portrayals.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the current provisions under the Cinematograph Act and Rules were insufficient to prevent stigmatizing or stereotypical representation of persons with disabilities. They contended that such depictions perpetuate myths, reinforce negative attitudes, and limit opportunities for individuals with disabilities.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Appellants' concerns regarding the portrayal of disabilities in visual media were legitimate and aligned with international conventions and principles promoting disability rights. The bench noted that the 'nothing about us, without us' principle should be put into practice in constituting statutory committees and assessing the impact of films on dignity.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an acquisition of land under the Acquisition Act, 2013. The compensation for the acquired land is to be determined based on its market value. The Collector's Guidelines framed under the Stamp Act are used to determine the circle rate for the year 2014-2015.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, argues that the circle rate fixed by the State Government is too high and does not reflect the true market value of the land. They claim that this rate should be reduced to compensate them for acquiring the land at a higher price than its actual worth.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that the Acquisition Act, 2013 requires the determination of market value based on Section 26(1). The clause (a) specifies the market value as per the Stamp Act. In this case, the Commissioner has applied the Collector's Guidelines by using the rate provided for non-converted agricultural land and supplemented it with additional assets attached to the land.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that the compensation has been calculated in accordance with the mandate of the Acquisition Act, 2013. The circle rate fixed by the State Government is considered as the market value for determining the compensation. The appeal filed by the appellant is dismissed, and there will be no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves multiple appeals related to land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The appeals are filed by various claimants against the State of Maharashtra and other respondents.
Each appeal concerns a specific plot or area in Akoli (kd) and Akoli (Bk), with varying sizes and locations.
Section 4 notifications were issued on different dates for each area under the Act, followed by Section 6 notifications and awards made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer.
The Reference Courts allowed the claims of the landowners, awarding compensation at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft., which was later confirmed by the High Court in some appeals.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments were presented by both the claimants (landowners) and the respondents (the State and its officers), regarding the valuation of the land, the applicability of the Act, and the computation of compensation.
The claimants argued that the land values had increased significantly after the Section 4 notifications, making the initial awards made under the Act outdated and inadequate.
They also claimed that the authorities had failed to consider the market rates and the actual worth of their properties at the time of acquisition.
On the other hand, the respondents maintained that the awards were made in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the applicable market rates at the time of notification.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the land values had indeed increased significantly after the Section 4 notifications, making the initial awards inadequate.
The court also noted that the authorities had failed to consider the market rates and the actual worth of the properties at the time of acquisition.
In multiple instances, the High Court confirmed the orders of the Reference Courts, awarding compensation at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft. to the landowners.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately upheld the decisions of the Reference Courts and the High Court in most appeals, affirming the awards made to the landowners for their properties acquired under the Act.
However, some appeals were dismissed or allowed in part, with the court exercising its discretion in computing compensation based on the specific circumstances of each case.

In the judgment, it was stated that "By the impugned order, the High Court confirmed the order of the Reference Court. Arguments are similar, hence, whatever has been held in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 6817 of 2023 and Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 2324 of 2023 would hold good for these Appeals also."
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The CIRP of ACIL was initiated, and the appellant paid a sum of Rs.38.87 crores to the 1st respondent-financial creditor under the resolution plan of the corporate guarantor-ACIL. The assets of the subsidiary company of ACIL cannot form part of the CIRP process of ACIL.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the payment of Rs.38.87 crores to the 1st respondent-financial creditor under the resolution plan would extinguish the liability of the 2nd respondent-principal borrower/corporate debtor to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction after deducting the amount paid on behalf of the corporate guarantor in terms of its resolution plan.
The appellant also argued that a holding company is not the owner of the assets of its subsidiary, and therefore, the assets of the subsidiaries cannot be included in the resolution plan of the holding company.
Furthermore, the appellant argued that by admitting an application under Section 7 of the IBC against the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor, the valuable assets of ACIL have been taken away.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the payment of Rs.38.87 crores to the 1st respondent-financial creditor would not extinguish the liability of the 2nd respondent-principal borrower/corporate debtor to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction after deducting the amount paid on behalf of the corporate guarantor in terms of its resolution plan.
The court also observed that a holding company is not the owner of the assets of its subsidiary, and therefore, the assets of the subsidiaries cannot be included in the resolution plan of the holding company.
Additionally, the court observed that the financial creditor can always file separate applications under Section 7 of the IBC against the corporate debtor and the corporate guarantor. The applications can be filed simultaneously as well.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal with no order as to costs, holding that the view taken by NCLAT cannot be faulted.
The court concluded that the liability of the 2nd respondent-principal borrower/corporate debtor to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction after deducting the amount paid on behalf of the corporate guarantor in terms of its resolution plan is not extinguished by the payment of Rs.38.87 crores to the 1st respondent-financial creditor.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award in India. The award debtor had deposited an amount of Rs. 7.5 crores on October 22, 2010, and another amount of Rs. 50 lakhs on June 3, 2011. However, these amounts could not be withdrawn by the award holder till the completion of the proceedings. The exchange rate was a point of contention between the parties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The applicability of the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961 (the "Act") to the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in India.
- The relevant date for determining the conversion rate of foreign award expressed in foreign currency.
- Whether the deposited amount must be converted as on the date of deposit or when the objections against the award are finally decided.
- The appropriate exchange rate to apply to convert the second deposit and the remaining amount due under the award.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The statutory scheme of the Act makes a foreign arbitral award enforceable when the objections against it are finally decided.
- When the award debtor deposits an amount before the court during the pendency of objections, the deposited amount must be converted as on the date of deposit.
- After conversion, the adjusted amount must be converted on the date when the arbitral award becomes enforceable, i.e., when the objections against it are finally decided.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court partly allowed the appeal and set aside the findings of the High Court to the extent that Forasol (supra) does not apply under the 1996 Act and that the exchange rate on January 7, 2014, must be used for converting the entire arbitral award and interest.
- The first deposit of Rs. 7.5 crores must be converted as on the date of deposit being October 22, 2010.
- The second deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs as well as the remaining amount due under the award must be converted when the objections proceedings attained finality on July 1, 2014.
- The Executing Court must determine the amount payable by taking into account the exchange rate as on July 1, 2014.

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the sale deed was valid despite not containing the signatures of all the parties. They relied on various judgments to support their argument.
The respondents argued that the sale deed was invalid due to the lack of signatures and other formalities.

The case involves an appeal against the grant of bail to an accused under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The accused was arrested in connection with a narcotics-related offense and applied for bail. The trial court denied the bail application, but the High Court granted it based on non-compliance with Section 52A of the Act regarding the disposal of seized contraband drugs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but based on the context, we can infer that:
* The prosecution argued for a strict interpretation of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, and emphasized the importance of following procedures like Section 52A.
* The defense argued that the non-compliance with Section 52A was a procedural irregularity that did not warrant denial of bail to the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
* The court emphasized the importance of following procedures under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, particularly Section 52A regarding disposal of seized contraband drugs.
* The court observed that non-compliance with these procedures would not vitiate the trial or entitle the accused to be released on bail.
* The court noted that the High Court's order granting bail was based on an incorrect interpretation of the law and was therefore erroneous.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Supreme Court is as follows:
* The appeal against the grant of bail by the High Court is allowed.
* The case is remanded to the High Court for fresh consideration on merits, with a request to decide the application afresh within four weeks.

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 is a comprehensive legislation aimed at ensuring accessibility for persons with disabilities
* The absence of non-negotiable rules in Rule 15 of the Draft Accessibility Standards makes it difficult to ensure compliance with the law
* Progressive compliance with standards listed in existing Rule 15 and targets set by the Accessible India Campaign must continue unabated

4.  Recruiting bodies, subject to the extant Rules, may devise appropriate procedure for bringing the recruitment process to its logical end provided the procedure so adopted is transparent, non-discriminatory/non-arbitrary and has a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved;
5.  Extant Rules having statutory force are binding on the recruiting body both in terms of procedure and eligibility;
6.  Placement in the select list gives no indefeasible right to appointment. The State or its instrumentality for bona fide reasons may choose not to fill up the vacancies.

The High Court held that the equitable mortgage was not enforceable against the appellant bank.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the respondent no. 1 bank argued in favor of its equitable mortgage being enforceable against the appellant bank, while the appellant bank contested this claim.
</ARGUMENTS>

</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellants (Central Bank of India) argued against the High Court's decision to allow the respondents (borrowers) to proceed with their civil suits. The respondents likely argued that they were entitled to claim damages from the bank due to its alleged negligence or misconduct.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was no error in the High Court's decision to vacate the interim order granted by the Supreme Court. The observation also highlights the need for standard guidelines for title search reports, fees, and costs associated with them to ensure high-quality reports.

Additionally, it is noted that the bank had sanctioned loans without proper verification of property titles, leading to potential criminal liability for its officers involved in loan approvals.

The case revolves around the interpretation of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and its applicability to professional services, specifically those rendered by lawyers. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) had earlier ruled that complaints under the Act would be maintainable in respect of deficiency in service rendered by lawyers.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the judge include:

*   The legal profession is a regulated profession in India, and its conduct is governed by the Advocates Act, 1961.
*   International practices suggest that consumer protection laws should be confined to 'consumers' only, implying the exclusion of professional services, especially those of lawyers.
*   The UNO's common resolution on which the Consumer Protection Act was framed implies a uniform application across nations.
*   Excluding professional services from consumer protection law would align with global practices and ensure certainty and finality in decision-making within the justice delivery system.

</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the judge include:

*   The era of globalization necessitates a uniform application of laws, particularly those framed on common resolutions.
*   Consumer protection laws should have universal application and be confined to 'consumers' only.
*   The services of professionals, especially lawyers, are sui generis and should be excluded from consumer protection law.

</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the judge includes:

*   The legislature in India had not intended to include professional services within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
*   The NCDRC's view that complaints under the Act would be maintainable in respect of deficiency in service rendered by lawyers is incorrect and stands overruled.

The appellant was convicted of murdering his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. The incident occurred in 1995, and the trial court convicted him in 1998. The High Court affirmed the conviction, and an appeal was filed with the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case revolved around the application of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with murder. The prosecution argued that the appellant had taken undue advantage and acted in a cruel manner during the fight, while the defense claimed that the deceased was equally responsible for the incident.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the incident occurred due to mutual provocation and aggravation between the parties involved. It observed that it is difficult to apportion blame to each fighter in such cases. The court also took into account the mitigating circumstances, including the fact that the appellant had brought his wife back home after divorcing her with triple talaq.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction of the appellant for murder. However, considering the mitigating circumstances and the lengthy period the appellant spent in prison (almost 11 years), the court granted liberty to the appellant to file a representation with the State Government praying for remission of sentence.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the appellant is seeking release on bail, and they consider it appropriate to impose certain conditions. The court sets out specific conditions for the appellant's release on bail, including restrictions on her movement and communication.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeal and directs the appellant to be released on bail under the specified conditions. The operative portion of the judgment is as follows:

"With these observations, we set aside the impugned judgment and direct that the appellant be released on bail on such conditions the Special Court may consider fit and proper but the conditions shall include the following:-

(h) The appellant shall not leave the State of Maharashtra without leave of the Special Court.

(i) The appellant shall surrender her passport, if she possesses one, with the Special Court, during the period she remains enlarged on bail.

(j) The appellant shall inform the Investigating Officer of the NIA the address where she shall reside during the period she remains enlarged on bail.

(k) The appellant shall use only one mobile number, during the time she remains on bail, and shall inform her mobile number to the Investigating Officer of the NIA.

(l) The appellant shall also ensure that her mobile phone remains active and charged round the clock so that she remains constantly accessible throughout the period she remains enlarged on bail.

(m) During this period, i.e. the period during which she remains on bail, the appellant shall keep the location status (GPS) of her mobile phone active, twenty-four hours a day, and her phone shall be paired with that of the Investigating Officer of the NIA to enable him, at any given time, to identify the appellants' exact location.

(n) The appellant, while on bail, shall report to the Station House Officer of the Police Station within whose jurisdiction she shall reside, once every fortnight."

In the event there is a breach of any of these conditions or any other condition that may be imposed by the Special Court independently, it would be open to the prosecution to seek cancellation of bail granted to the appellant before the Special Court only, without any further reference to this Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the admissibility of confessional statements made to officers empowered under Section 41 and 42 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) 1985. The appellants were charged with offenses under the NDPS Act, and their confessional statements were recorded by the empowered officers.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:
* The NDPS Act empowers certain officers to conduct searches and seizures without warrant, but these officers do not have the power to investigate or file police reports. 
* Therefore, their confessional statements cannot be considered as made to a "police officer" within the meaning of Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) 1872.
* The officers empowered under Section 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act are not authorized to investigate or file police reports, and thus their confessional statements do not fall within the purview of Section 25 of the IEA 1872.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made in the case include:
* The empowered officers under Section 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act have limited powers, which only extend to conducting searches and seizures without warrant.
* The confessional statements recorded by these officers are not admissible as evidence against the accused in a trial under the NDPS Act.
* A distinction is drawn between the officers empowered under Section 53 of the NDPS Act, who are considered "police officers" within the meaning of Section 25 of the IEA 1872, and those empowered under Section 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is as follows:
* The appeals of the appellants are allowed, and their convictions are set aside.
* The impugned judgments of the High Court and the Trial Court are also set aside.
* The appellants are acquitted of the charges framed against them due to the inadmissibility of their confessional statements under Section 67 of the NDPS Act 1985.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the mutation of revenue records for a subject land. The appellant had obtained a consent decree in their favor, but the authorities refused to update the revenue records. The Collector of Stamps determined stamp duty on the consent decree as per Article 22 of Schedule IA of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that:
- The appellant's argument may focus on the fact that the consent decree only asserts pre-existing rights and does not transfer any new right, making it exempt from stamp duty.
- The respondent's (authorities) argument may rely on the Collector of Stamps' determination of stamp duty as per Article 22 of Schedule IA of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The consent decree does not fall under the instruments mentioned in the Schedule and only asserts pre-existing rights.
- Therefore, it does not require any payment of stamp duty.
- The authorities' decision to uphold the Collector of Stamps' determination is incorrect.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The impugned order passed by the High Court upholding the orders of the authorities below has no legs to stand and is hence, set aside.
- This appeal stands allowed, and the authority concerned shall make mutation of the revenue records in respect of the subject land in favor of the appellant.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent raised an objection on the deficit stamp duty before the stage of admission of the instrument in evidence. The trial court is yet to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act, and it has called for a report from the District Registrar.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the imposition of penalty of ten times at this juncture in the facts and circumstances of this case is illegal and contrary to the steps summed up in paragraph 21. The instrument is sent to the District Registrar, thereafter the District Registrar in exercise of his jurisdiction under Section 39 of the Act, decides the quantum of stamp duty and penalty payable on the instrument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the finality is subject to the just exceptions envisaged by the Act addressing different contingencies. The scheme does not prohibit a party to a document to first invoke directly the jurisdiction of the District Registrar and present the instrument before Court/Every Person after complying with the requirement of duty and penalty.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the direction to pay ten times the penalty of the deficit stamp duty merits interference and accordingly is set aside. The trial court is directed to send the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999 to the District Registrar to determine the deficit stamp duty and penalty payable. Upon receipt of the compliance certificate from the District Registrar, without reference to an objection under the Act, the suit document be received in evidence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent no.1 was granted bail by the High Court in connection with Crime 217/2019, registered with Police Station Kotwali, Nagpur. The respondent was accused of offences punishable under sections 409, 420, 467, 478, 471, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, as well as Section 3 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act.
The respondent had already suffered incarceration for a period of about six months at the time when bail was granted.
Investigations revealed that the respondent had an active role in the alleged economic offence affecting a large number of people.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court erred in law by granting bail to the respondent without imposing strict and additional conditions, considering the nature of the alleged offence.
The discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge of the High Court was not in tune with the principles that conventionally govern the exercise of such power.
The release on bail could seriously lead to dissipation of the properties where investments had allegedly been made out of Society funds.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case involved economic offences affecting a large number of people, and the respondent's active role in the alleged scam was revealed through investigations.
The High Court imposed usual conditions simpliciter without considering the severity of the offence.
Although the respondent had already suffered incarceration for six months at the time when bail was granted, their release on bail could lead to dissipation of properties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal succeeds. The impugned order stands set aside. Respondent No.1 is directed to surrender within a period of three weeks from today, failing which the trial Court shall proceed in accordance with law.
The observations made hereinabove are limited to the aspect of testing the legality of the impugned order and shall not be treated as definitive/conclusive regarding respondent no.1 or any other accused.
The authorities concerned are directed to render appropriate care and assistance as regards the medical condition of the respondent no.1.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the criminal proceedings pending against the appellant before the CJM, Varanasi. The appellant is accused of offenses under Sections 353 and 186 of the IPC. The CJM, Varanasi, took cognizance of the offenses and issued a summons to the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's defense team argued that the CJM, Varanasi, did not follow the due process contemplated under the provisions of law while taking cognizance of the offenses. They contended that the orders passed by the CJM, Varanasi, were contrary to law and warrant interference from the higher court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's decision in Application Under Section 482 No. 35311 of 2023 was examined. However, it was noted that the High Court did not consider any of the issues discussed in this appeal. The order was dismissed in limine by this Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This Court has reiterated that an order rejecting a special leave petition at the threshold without detailed reasons does not constitute any declaration of law or a binding precedent. The Court concluded that taking cognizance by the CJM, Varanasi, of the offenses under Section 353 and 186 of the IPC was not done in accordance with due process. As such, all orders passed pursuant to this were contrary to law and warranted interference from the higher court.

The appeal is allowed by quashing Case No. 9790 of 2015 arising out of Case Crime No. 290 of 2015 under Sections 353 and 186 of the IPC, pending before the Court of the CJM, Varanasi, and the consequent orders passed by the CJM, Varanasi in taking cognizance and issuing a summons to the appellant.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellants were summoned by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED alleged that the Appellants had received Rs. 168 Crores, which was transferred through vouchers to Delhi and Overseas. The Appellants challenged the summons, stating that it was issued without jurisdiction and that they were not required to attend in person.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments made by the Appellants include:
- The ED did not have jurisdiction to issue the summons as a part of the offence had been allegedly committed outside Delhi.
- The Appellants were not required to attend in person and could produce authorized agents instead.
- The summons was issued without proper authority and was therefore void.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that:
- The ED has the territorial jurisdiction to issue the summons as a part of the offence had been allegedly committed within Delhi.
- The Appellants were bound to attend in person or through authorized agents as per Section 50(3) of the PMLA.
- The proceedings under Section 50 are deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of Section 193 and 228 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that:
- Both Appeals were devoid of merits.
- The ED had jurisdiction to issue the summons, and the Appellants were bound to attend in person or through authorized agents.
- The Appellant No.2, Rujira Banerjee, failed to produce the documents as required by the summons and was liable for prosecution under Section 63 PMLA r/w Section 174 IPC.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the eviction of the first appellant's premises by the respondents. The Inquiry Officer was appointed to conduct the inquiry proceedings under section 105B of the Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* Whether the Inquiry Officer had a personal interest in the lis and thus, bias cannot be imputed?
* Whether the State Government should be impleaded in the proceedings under section 105B of the Act?
* Whether the Inquiry Officer's competence to proceed with the inquiry was affected by the absence of regulations being framed under section 105H of the Act?
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had already rendered a finding on the issue of the Inquiry Officer's independence as a quasi-judicial officer under the Act. The Court also observed that mere non-framing of regulations would not entitle the respondents to keep the proceedings in abeyance.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that:

* If the officers have no personal interest in the lis, bias cannot be imputed; especially since, the officer is acting as a quasi-judicial authority.
* The State Government's impleadment was superfluous given that the subject premises belonged to the first appellant and the legality of the proceedings had already been held against the respondents.
* Even in the absence of regulations being framed under section 105H of the Act, the proceedings for eviction can be continued by the Inquiry Officer by adhering to principles of natural justice.
* The civil appeals stand allowed, and the Inquiry Officer is directed to allow both parties to lead evidence and raise whatever points are available in defense.

The impugned order entertaining writ petitions which were not maintainable did not warrant the High Court to exercise jurisdiction by framing points for determination by the Inquiry Officer. The same is indefensible and is set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, specifically sub-sections (1) and (2). The court is considering whether a female heir can claim a higher right under Section 14(1) despite being conferred a limited estate under Section 14(2).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court discusses various previous judgments on the matter, including Karmi, Bhura, Gumpha, and Sadhu Singh. It notes that while some decisions follow the principle laid down in Karmi, others have made discordant observations but not clearly overruled it.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that there is a need for clarity and certainty in interpreting Section 14 of the Act due to inconsistent principles among previous judgments. It also notes that some decisions have tried to distinguish between facts or ignore binding decisions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the Registry to place its order along with the appeal paper book before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constituting an appropriate larger bench. The purpose is to reconcile the principles laid down in various judgments and restate the law on the interplay between sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 14.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between the plaintiff and defendants regarding a contract for the sale of immovable property. The alleged contract was executed through exchange of communications dated 16.01.2004 and 20.01.2004, respectively. The contract stipulated that 10% of the total sale consideration had to be paid immediately by the plaintiff upon booking, 85% of the sale consideration had to be paid by 28.02.2004, and the balance 5% of the sale consideration had to be paid at the time of notice for possession of the premises.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case revolved around the interpretation of Section 16(d) of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) and its applicability to the suit. The plaintiff's counsel argued that the absence of a specific prayer seeking transfer of possession would not affect the character of the suit, which is one covered by Section 16(d) of the CPC.
The defendants' counsel argued that the inclusion or absence of a prayer for transfer of possession was decisive of the true nature of the suit and that the plaintiff's failure to specifically pray for transfer of possession rendered the court without jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Several key observations were made in the case:
- The alleged contract between the parties contained stipulations regarding payment and transfer of possession, which is a critical aspect of immovable property transactions governed by the Transfer of Property Act.
- The interplay between Sections 22 and 28 of the Specific Relief Act and Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act was discussed, highlighting that handing over possession of the immovable property in respect of which a decree of specific performance has been granted is incidental to the main relief sought.
- If the court were to hold that a plaintiff can file a suit for specific performance without praying for transfer of possession and subsequently amend the plaint to include such a prayer after obtaining a decree, it would create an opportunity for misuse of the law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) were dismissed by the court. The interim relief granted earlier was vacated, and it was now left to the plaintiff to present the plaint before a competent court and have their suit adjudicated on merits in accordance with the law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of provisions under a specific Act, with the Supreme Court being asked to clarify its stance on whether certain judgments are binding precedents. The court is also considering referring the matter to a three-judge bench for further deliberation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
No explicit arguments are presented in the given text, as it appears to be a judicial decision rather than an adversarial proceeding. However, the discussion suggests that the Supreme Court is examining its own precedential value and seeking clarity on the binding nature of certain judgments within the framework of Article 141.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes the difficulty faced by lower courts in determining whether a particular judgment is intended to provide finality or establish precedent. It also mentions that even obiter dicta of the Supreme Court are considered binding for the High Courts and subordinate courts, which adds complexity to the interpretation process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court expresses its opinion on the interpretation of provisions under the Act but decides not to conclusively decide the matter. Instead, it deems it appropriate to refer the appeal to a three-judge bench for further consideration and clarity. The Registry is directed to place the appeal paperbooks along with the detailed judgment before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the impugned judgement of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad passed in Application u/s 482 No. 18712 of 2020. The appellant (Naresh Aneja) is one of the accused persons, along with R.K Aneja. The FIR No. 1074 of 2019 was lodged against them by the complainant. The documents and submissions on record do not point to the appellant having committed any offence against the complainant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in this case are:
* The High Court's inherent powers can be exercised to quash a proceeding if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed.
* The court should not permit a proceeding to degenerate into a weapon of harassment or persecution.
* The test is whether the allegations in the complaint disclose a criminal offence or not.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The High Court's inherent powers are designed to achieve a salutary public purpose, which is that a court proceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment or persecution.
* In a criminal case, the veiled object behind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on which the structure of the prosecution rests, and the like would justify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in the interest of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The sum total of the circumstances, submissions, and documents on record do not point to the appellant (Naresh Aneja) having committed any offence against the complainant.
* The impugned judgement of the High Court is set aside, and the criminal proceedings arising out of FIR No. 1074 of 2019 are quashed qua the present appellant.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between Reena, the appellant, and Dinesh, the respondent, regarding maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. Reena had filed a maintenance application (Original Maintenance Case No. 454 of 2019) in the Family Court, Dhanbad, on 03.08.2019. The Family Court granted maintenance to Reena at ₹10,000 per month from the date of filing the application. However, Dinesh challenged this order in a criminal revision petition (Criminal Revision No. 440 of 2022) before the High Court of Jharkhand.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Reena argued that she had sufficient reason to stay away from her husband's society due to his ill-treatment and lack of bonafides. She contended that the restitution decree was disobeyed by Dinesh, who did not seek its execution or divorce under Section 13(1A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Reena claimed that she was entitled to maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C.
Dinesh argued that the disqualification under Section 125(4) Cr.P.C. applied to Reena since she refused to live with him despite the passing of a decree for restitution of conjugal rights.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that Dinesh's attempt to project the disobeyed restitution decree as a defence and protect himself from a claim by Reena for maintenance was a demonstration of his lack of bonafides. The Court noted that the events after 2017, particularly the lack of any attempt at reconciliation or execution of the restitution decree, were relevant in determining the entitlement of Reena to maintenance.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment dated 04.08.2023 passed by the High Court of Jharkhand. The order dated 15.02.2022 passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Dhanbad, was restored. The respondent (Dinesh) was directed to pay maintenance @ ₹10,000 per month to Reena from the date of filing the maintenance application (03.08.2019). Arrears of maintenance were ordered to be paid in three equal installments.

<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of the High Court in Criminal Application No. 4015 of 2014 dated 05.05.2017, and a FIR dated 25.03.2013 bearing Crime No. 81/2013 filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC at P.S. Jalna.
The FIR was filed by the wife of one of the accused against her husband and others for alleged harassment and physical abuse.
An investigation was conducted, and a chargesheet dated 30.07.2013 bearing Chargesheet No. 123/2013 was filed in the above FIR.
The appellants argued that none of the ingredients of Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC are made out, and if the criminal proceedings are allowed to continue against them, it would be nothing short of abuse of process of law and travesty of justice.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' main argument is that none of the ingredients of Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC are made out. They also argued that Jalna Police Station and the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jalna did not have jurisdiction.
Their counsel relied on various judgments to support their contention that the FIR and chargesheet cannot be sustained.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had rejected the petition for quashing of the FIR filed by the appellants.
The FIR was based on a complaint made by the wife of one of the accused, alleging harassment and physical abuse.
The investigation conducted by the police did not find any evidence to support the allegations made in the FIR.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the present appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court, and quashed the FIR dated 25.03.2013 bearing Crime No. 81/2013 filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC at P.S. Jalna and the chargesheet dated 30.07.2013 bearing Chargesheet No. 123/2013 in the above FIR.
The Court observed that if the criminal proceedings are allowed to continue against the appellants, it would be nothing short of abuse of process of law and travesty of justice.
The judgment was delivered on September 25, 2024, by a bench consisting of Justices Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Pankaj Mithal.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a composite suit filed for cancellation of the Sale Deed and recovery of possession. The plaintiff's original prayer was also for recovery of possession, but the substantive prayer was for cancellation of the sale deed dated 19-4-1996.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court treated the relief for possession as a consequential prayer and the relief for cancellation of Sale Deed as the substantive prayer. The limitation period was considered with respect to the substantive relief of cancellation of Sale Deed, which would be three years from the date of knowledge of Sale Deed sought to be cancelled.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the suit was barred by limitation and therefore dismissed it. The judgment stated that when a composite suit is filed for cancellation of Sale Deed as well as for recovery of possession, the limitation period should be considered with respect to the substantive relief of cancellation of Sale Deed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant has been incarcerated for 15 months or more for the offence punishable under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The trial of the scheduled offences and, consequently, the PMLA offence is not likely to be completed in three to four years or even more.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the learned Solicitor General (SG) relied upon indicate that the appellant's influential position in the State may have resulted in a so-called compromise between the bribe givers and the bribe takers. Considering the apprehension of the appellant tampering with the evidence, stringent conditions must be imposed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There are cases where clean acquittal is granted by the criminal courts to the accused after very long incarceration as an undertrial. When we say clean acquittal, we are excluding the cases where the witnesses have turned hostile or there is a bona fide defective investigation. In such cases of clean acquittal, crucial years in the life of the accused are lost.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the appellant shall be enlarged on bail till the final disposal of CC No. 9 of 2023 pending before the Principal Session Judge, Chennai, on the following conditions:
- The appellant shall furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs.25,00,000/­ (Rupees twenty-five lakhs only) with two sureties in the like amount.
- The appellant shall not directly or indirectly attempt to contact or communicate with the prosecution witnesses and victims of the three scheduled offences in any manner.
- The appellant shall mark his attendance every Monday and Friday between 11 am and 12 noon in the office of the Deputy Director, the Directorate of Enforcement at Chennai. He shall also appear on the first Saturday of every calendar month before the investigating officers of the three scheduled offences.
- Before the appellant is enlarged on bail, he shall surrender his passport to the Special Court under the PMLA at Chennai.
- The appellant shall regularly and punctually remain present before the Courts dealing with scheduled offences as well as the Special Court and shall cooperate with the Courts for early disposal of cases.
- If the appellant seeks adjournments on non-existing or frivolous grounds or creates hurdles in the early disposal of the cases mentioned above, the bail granted to him shall be liable to be cancelled.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Section 29A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A & C Act). The section deals with the extension of time period for making an arbitral award. The court is considering whether an application for extension of the time period can be made after the expiry of the twelve-month or six-month period.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court references a previous decision that held an application for extension of the time period under Section 29A(5) is maintainable even after the expiry of the specified periods. The court also notes that the mandate of the arbitral tribunal continues where an application under sub-section (5) is pending.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the power to extend time period for making of the award vests with the court, and not with the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal may not pronounce the award till an application under Section 29A(5) of the A & C Act is sub-judice before the court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that an application for extension of the time period for passing an arbitral award under Section 29A(4) read with Section 29A(5) is maintainable even after the expiry of the twelve-month or the extended six-month period, as the case may be. The court also states that while adjudicating such extension applications, it will be guided by the principle of sufficient cause.

The appellant was previously convicted and sentenced to death by the Trial Court. The High Court later acquitted him, but a subsequent order for reinvestigation was given, which would classify as meeting the third condition for double jeopardy.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented were based on the three conditions laid down in T.P. Gopalakrishnan (supra) for double jeopardy to apply:
• There must have been previous proceedings before a court of law or judicial tribunal with competent jurisdiction where the person was prosecuted.
• The conviction or acquittal in the previous proceeding must be in force at the time of the second proceeding related to the same offense and set of facts.
• The subsequent proceeding must be a fresh proceeding where the person is sought to be prosecuted and punished for the same offense and set of facts.

The court considered that these conditions were met in this case, leading to a violation of Article 20(2) of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court noted the distinction between retrial and reinvestigation. The court concluded that an order for reinvestigation begins from zero, effectively meeting the third condition.

Additionally, it was mentioned that the principle of double jeopardy is recognized in Indian law through various provisions, including Section 300 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and acquitted the appellant of all charges. The High Court's direction for reinvestigation was set aside as it violated Article 20(2) of the Constitution.

Pending applications were also disposed of, with the appeal being allowed in accordance with the judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute related to court fees in the context of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods, specifically Lok Adalat and mediation. The original dispute was settled amicably, and the amount of court fees involved was approximately Rs. 5 lakhs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellant's argument: 
The appellant sought a refund of the court fees paid in respect of the plaint, which had been settled by way of ADR (Lok Adalat).

Respondent's argument:
The respondent did not provide any arguments in the given text.

Judge's observation:
The High Court suggested to the State legislature that the differences in court fees for Lok Adalat and other forms of ADR should be done away with to promote the adaptation of such methods of dispute resolution among the public.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations:

* Lok Adalat and mediation are distinct methods of dispute resolution and cannot be equated.
* The State legislature has introduced Section 16A in the Maharashtra Court-fees Act, providing for a refund of court fees in its entirety when matters are settled under the processes mentioned in Section 89 CPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that this appeal lacks merit and is liable to be dismissed. However, considering the peculiar facts of the case, including the original dispute being settled amicably and the amount of court fees involved not being excessive, the Court ordered a refund of the said amount.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a matter that went to the High Court in revision. The High Court refused to interfere with an order dated 30th May 2008 passed by the learned Special Judge, which was later stayed by the Supreme Court vide order dated 26th October 2010.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in the case is that the learned Special Judge acted in a predetermined manner while passing the order dated 30th May 2008. It is stated that the judge failed to apply his mind properly and instead relied on a judgment that had already been challenged by both parties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the learned Special Judge's order dated 30th May 2008 was liable to be set aside due to the judge's non-application of mind. The court also noted that the order reflected a predetermined decision-making process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the judgment and order dated 14th October 2010 passed by the High Court in Criminal Revision No. 2194 of 2008, and quashed the observations made by the learned Special Judge in paragraphs 49 and 50 of the judgment and order of conviction/acquittal dated 22nd/24th February 2007. The court also directed that all subsequent proceedings including the notice issued by the learned Special Judge dated 26th February 2007 and the order dictated and typed on 30th May 2008 be quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the second respondent against the first respondent. The FIR was registered based on the complaint dated 11.11.2010, and an investigation was conducted. After considering the narazi petition and hearing the complainant, the final report was accepted. Subsequently, a protest petition (narazi petition) was filed, which was heard by the learned CJM. Despite this, the second respondent filed another complaint on 20.07.2011, reproducing the original complaint dated 11.11.2010 and stating that the investigation in the FIR was not proper.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant (first respondent) argued against the maintainability of the second complaint, while the respondents (second respondent and others) may have argued for its maintainability.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that repeated complaints by frustrated litigants cannot be maintained. The core of the original complaint dated 11.11.2010 and the second complaint dated 20.07.2011 is the same. No new facts or evidence were presented in the second complaint.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the decision of the High Court dated 08.01.2021, as well as the decision of the learned Sessions Judge that got confirmation by the judgment of the High Court. The order of the learned CJM dated 12.07.2012 was restored, and it was held that the complaint dated 20.07.2011 stands rejected for not being maintainable.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellant, a juvenile, was wrongly convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for almost 25 years. The case involved the failure of the Court to apply the mandatory provisions of the 2015 Act regarding the plea of juvenility. The Appellant's age was tacitly admitted by the Executive, and he had been suffering due to the error committed by the Courts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant's counsel argued that the Court should have dealt with the plea of juvenility under the existing laws at the relevant point of time. The Appellant's age was clearly admitted, and there was no need for an inquiry. The Writ Petition filed by the Appellant raised an independent prayer for the enforcement of a right conferred under a social welfare legislation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Appellant had lost an opportunity to reintegrate into society due to the error committed by the Courts. The time he had lost could never be restored. The Appellant's conduct in prison was normal, with no adverse reports.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the Appeal and set aside the sentence imposed in excess of the upper limit prescribed under the relevant Act while maintaining the conviction rendered. The Appellant was directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. The Uttarakhand State Legal Services Authority (State Authority) was directed to play a proactive role in identifying welfare schemes for the Appellant's rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a property dispute between the parties. The first partition suit was filed in 1996, and the matter has been ongoing for more than two decades. The pre-emption Act of 1973 is mentioned as an aspect that requires consideration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court observed that the first partition suit could not have been decreed under the Punjab Pre-Emption (Repeal) Act, 1973. However, this observation was made in error, as the discussion of pre-emption corresponds to an earlier transaction between Lal Singh and his son.
The appellant's objections were rejected by the First Appellate Court, which is being challenged in this appeal. The High Court noted that the entitlement of share is admitted by the parties.
The Court also observed that the discussion on pre-emption appears to correspond to an earlier transaction having taken place somewhere in the 1930s and 1940s by one Lal Singh, father of the plaintiffs in the first partition suit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The matter has been ongoing for more than two decades. The Court observed that despite the passage of time, the litigant still faces problems similar to those faced in the past.
The pre-emption Act of 1973 is mentioned as an aspect that requires consideration, but its relevance to the present case is unclear.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals are allowed to the extent that the matter is remanded to the First Appellate Court to take a decision on the objections of the appellant afresh, on merits. The concerned Court is requested to take all steps necessary for expeditious disposal of the case.
The High Court's observation regarding the pre-emption Act of 1973 was noted as being in error.
A copy of this judgment is to be forwarded to the learned Registrar General of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana who shall then ensure its passage to the concerned Court, expeditiously.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant had lodged a complaint regarding the custodial death of his employee, Ram Kishore. The police had taken Ram Kishore into custody, and the appellant was concerned about his safety. He caused the presence of Ram Kishore before the Police Station, which led to the registration of a custodial death case under FIR No. 371/1993.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's case was that Ram Kishore was under the control of the police in the Police Station. The appellant's actions were seen as an attempt to cause the presence of Ram Kishore before the Police Station, which led to the registration of a custodial death case.
However, the defense argued that there was no ground for proceeding against the appellant based on the final report dated 21.02.2000 in Crime No.371/1993 of CBCID, U.P. Lucknow. They claimed that the mere fact of rejection of the application of the appellant for discharge is concurrent and cannot be a reason for confirming the impugned order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court did not consider the matter in the manner required under law, given the facts and circumstances of the case. The court noted that there was no consideration of the grounds for proceeding against the appellant based on the materials produced by the prosecution.
The observations made in this judgment are limited to the disposal of this appeal and do not touch upon the merits of the case against the other accused in Crime No.371/1993 of CBCID, U.P. Lucknow.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal is allowed. The order and judgment dated 21.04.2023 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in application No.21739 of 2007 filed under Section 482, Cr.PC, and the order dated 19.04.2007 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge (CBI) are set aside.
The application filed by the appellant under Section 227, Cr.PC, dated 04.04.2007 for discharge in Crime No.351/1993 filed in Sessions Trial No.1532/2005 before Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge (CBI), Prevention of Corruption Act U.P., East Ghaziabad is allowed, and the appellant stands discharged.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the retrospective application of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021 (MADA). The court is considering whether MADA should be given prospective effect or not. The assesses have been paying taxes and other dues under the relevant statutes for more than three decades.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Solicitor General submitted that the States may wish to forego the dues accrued before the decision in MADA (supra). However, it is the prerogative of the State legislatures to determine whether to forego the dues for the period before 25 July 2024. The court also considered the equities of the assesses and decided that they should not be burdened with retrospective demands.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the delay in the court proceedings should not be to the detriment of the assesses. It also observed that the total amount, including principal and interest, due by the assesses may be substantial in comparison to their total net worth.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment rejects the submission that MADA (supra) should be given prospective effect. However, bearing in mind the consequences that would emanate from the past period, the following conditionalities are directed to prevail:
a. While the States may levy or renew demands of tax, if any, pertaining to Entries 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule in terms of the law laid down in the decision in MADA (supra), the demand of tax shall not operate on transactions made prior to 1 April 2005.
b. The time for payment of the demand of tax shall be staggered in instalments over a period of twelve years commencing from 1 April 2026.
c. The levy of interest and penalty on demands made for the period before 25 July 2024 shall stand waived for all the assesses.

<FUNCTS>
The appeal is related to the bail of an accused individual, and the case involves various legal arguments and considerations regarding the right to life and personal liberty as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
</FUNCTs>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented:

* The accused's continued incarceration cannot be justified, and bail should be granted.
* The impugned order dated 03.04.2023 of the High Court is set aside and quashed.
* Various conditions are imposed for granting bail, including:
	+ Trial court shall impound the passport and/or citizenship document(s) of the accused.
	+ Accused shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court.
	+ Accused shall appear before the trial court on each and every date of the trial.
	+ Accused shall mark his attendance before the police station indicated by the trial court once in every fortnight till conclusion of the trial.
	+ Accused shall not tamper with evidence and shall not threaten witnesses.
* If there is any violation of bail conditions, it would be open to the prosecution to move the trial court for cancellation of bail.

The arguments are based on various precedents, including K.A. Najeeb (supra) and Frank Vitus (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made:

* The right to life and personal liberty enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution is overarching and sacrosanct.
* A constitutional court cannot be restrained from granting bail to an accused on account of restrictive statutory provisions in a penal statute if it finds that the right of the accused-undertrial under Article 21 has been infringed.
* In the given facts of a particular case, a constitutional court may decline to grant bail. However, it would be very wrong to say that under a particular statute, bail cannot be granted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Judgment:
The appeal is disposed of by granting bail to the accused subject to certain conditions.

* The impugned order dated 03.04.2023 of the High Court is set aside and quashed.
* Accused is directed to be released on bail, subject to fulfilment of the following conditions:
	+ Trial court shall impound the passport and/or citizenship document(s) of the accused.
	+ Accused shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; he shall furnish his address to the trial court.
	+ He shall appear before the trial court on each and every date of the trial.
	+ In addition to the above, the accused shall mark his attendance before the police station indicated by the trial court once in every fortnight till conclusion of the trial.
	+ He shall not tamper with evidence and shall not threaten witnesses.
* If there is any violation of bail conditions as above, it would be open to the prosecution to move the trial court for cancellation of bail.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a land acquisition dispute in which the respondents claimed that their rights under Section 5A of the 1894 Act were not properly complied with. The matter had been pending for several years, and the respondents had filed objections under Section 5A.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had held that there was non-compliance with the procedure mandated by Section 5A of the 1894 Act, but the Supreme Court disagreed. The respondents argued that the Collector's decision to issue a corrigendum was improper and raised suspicions about the fairness of the proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the corrigendum issued by the Collector was largely insignificant as it merely contained the record of proceedings held before the hearing. The court noted that there was nothing in the contents of the corrigendum to draw adverse inference or doubt the fairness of the procedure followed for deciding the objections.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned main judgment dated 05.01.2017 of the High Court, and dismissed the writ petitions filed by the respondents on the ground that there was non-compliance with the procedure mandated by Section 5A of the 1894 Act. The court ordered that the compensation amount, if already not paid, fully or partly, as per the award of the Collector, shall be paid to the respondents and other land-owners along with interest at the statutory rate within 4 weeks.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FILTER> 

<FILTER>

<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal by the Appellant, where the prosecution case against him is based on a dying declaration recorded under Section 161 CrPC. The declarant, Tularam, made the statement a day after the incident, and it was recorded by the Investigating Officer. The medical report did not mention that Tularam's condition was serious in nature, and he was able to convey his statement properly.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant argued that the dying declaration should be disregarded solely for want of a doctor's fitness certification. However, the prosecution contended that the requirement for a dying declaration to be recorded in the presence of a doctor is merely a matter of prudence and not mandatory.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the mere non-obtainment of a medical fitness certificate will not deter it from considering a properly recorded statement under Section 161 CrPC to be a dying declaration. The Court also noted that where eyewitnesses state that the deceased was in a fit and conscious state to make the declaration, medical opinion cannot prevail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that there are no contradictions or discrepancies in the prosecution case of such a nature that would compel it to take a view different than that of the Trial Court and the High Court. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed, and if the Appellant is on bail, his bail bonds were cancelled, and he was directed to surrender and undergo the remainder of the sentence.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The ED case (HIU-II/14/2022) and CBI FIR (RC0032022A0053 of 2022) were registered against the appellant. The case involves thousands of pages of documents and over a lakh pages of digitized documents, making it impossible to conclude the trial in the near future.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the learned ASG regarding the possibility of tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses were addressed by imposing stringent conditions upon the appellant. The court also recognized that bail is a rule and refusal is an exception, and prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty should not be permitted to become punishment without trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the case has 493 named witnesses, making it impossible to conclude the trial in the near future. The objective of keeping someone in judicial custody pending trial or disposal of an appeal is to secure the attendance of the prisoner at trial. In this case, the appellant's deep roots in society and lack of possibility of fleeing made him a suitable candidate for bail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were allowed, and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Delhi was quashed and set aside. The appellant was directed to be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- with two sureties of the like amount. Additional conditions included surrendering the passport to the Special Court, reporting to the Investigating Officer on every Monday and Thursday between 10-11 AM, and not attempting to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence.

<FACTS>
The writ petition was filed to enforce the guidelines issued by Respondent No.5, which provides benefits for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in writing examinations. The guidelines were issued pursuant to the directions of the Court and were applicable to all authorities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the guidelines should be enforced uniformly across all authorities, and that the benefits conferred by the statute should be provided for all PwD candidates without any hindrance. It was also contended that rights under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution can be claimed against private entities and override the principle laid down in Rajbir (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the guidelines issued by Respondent No.5 had to be enforced, and that the benefits for PwD candidates should be extended to all PwDs without any restrictions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court directed Respondent No.5 to revisit the Office Memorandum dated 10.08.2022, remove the restrictions, and grant relaxations in a reasonable manner. The following directions were given:

(i) All authorities/recruitment agencies/examining bodies should uniformly follow the guidelines issued by Respondent No.5.
(ii) Periodic sensitization drives should be conducted at educational institutions to raise awareness among examination conducting bodies.
(iii) A grievance redressal portal should be set up to register complaints, which would permit candidates to approach it first before approaching the Court of law.
(iv) The guidelines framed by different authorities should be inspected and re-notified with an aim to ensure compliance.
(v) The validity of the scribe certificate should be extended to prevent long wait times after applying, especially in rural areas.
(vi) Incentive programs for scribes should be set up to ensure their availability and provide necessary training.
(vii) PwD candidates should be offered a choice of examination modes, such as scribe, braille, large print, audio recording of answers, etc.
(viii) Penal action should be taken against authorities/officers in charge who fail to follow the guidelines set out by Respondent No.5 and formulate guidelines which exclude PwDs.
(ix) The persons working for respondent authorities should be sensitized and trained on a regular basis to address the reasonable accommodation needs of PwDs.
(x) Strict compliance with the letter and spirit of the judgments in Vikash Kumar and Avni Prakash as well as the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016, should be ensured with a special focus on 'reasonable accommodation'.

The court argues that:
- There is no allegation of forcible entry or intimidation or insult or annoyance made by any official of ATC.
- No case can be made out against the respondents-accused persons under sections 336, 447, and 448 IPC.
- The Aircraft Act, 1934, and its rules constitute a complete code for safety and security in civil aviation and aerodromes.

The case involves the Bombay High Court's dismissal of writ petitions on the ground of delay and laches. The appellants/writ petitioners are land losers who were entitled to compensation in the form of FSI/TDR. The Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) had not complied with the regulations regarding the payment of compensation, leading to uncertainty in law. The High Court's decision was challenged by the writ petitioners/appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:

* The MMC argued that the delay and laches on the part of the appellants/writ petitioners rendered them ineligible for compensation.
* The writ petitioners/appellants argued that the delay was due to uncertainty in law and that they were entitled to compensation as per the regulations. They also contended that the MMC had not established any prejudice or third-party rights being created due to the delay.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court include:

* The doctrine of delay and laches, as well as the principle of abandonment of claim or waiver, do not apply in these cases.
* The delay has occurred on the part of the MMC in complying with the regulations regarding compensation to land losers.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the Court states:

* Those portions of the impugned order dated 18.12.2018, which dismissed the writ petitions on the ground of delay and laches, are set aside.
* The respondent MMC is directed to consider the case of those writ petitioners/appellants in light of the judgments of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I and release the balance FSI/TDR to the appellants.
* In the case of appellant-Kukreja Construction company and others, the MMC is directed to consider the nature of the amenities constructed and thereafter consider their case for additional FSI/TDR.

The case involves a convict who has undergone more than 14 years and 10 months of actual incarceration. The convict is seeking pre-mature release under the provision/policy in vogue at the time of his conviction, or a more beneficial policy if applicable.
</Funct Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The convict's contention that his case be considered by the provision/policy in vogue at the time of his conviction, if not, a more beneficial policy could be applied. The State Government shall pass a reasoned order expeditiously and latest within 3 months from the date of filing such representation.

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court held that a convict cannot seek remission as a matter of right. However, he has a right to claim that his case for the grant of remission ought to be considered in accordance with the law and/or applicable policy adopted by the appropriate Government.
The effect of remitting the sentence, in part or full, results in the restoration of liberty of a convict. If the order granting remission is to be cancelled or revoked, it will naturally affect the liberty of the convict.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal to the Supreme Court of India regarding an arbitration matter. The appellant had filed a claim under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (ACA), seeking the appointment of an arbitrator. However, the High Court of Delhi did not refer certain parties to arbitration in its order. The appellant argued that the arbitral tribunal has the power to implead these parties as respondents during the proceedings.
The underlying contract between the parties contains an arbitration clause (Clause 40) that requires disputes to be resolved through arbitration. Respondent nos. 2 and 3 are non-signatories to this agreement but have, through their conduct, consented to perform contractual obligations under the LLP Agreement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that a notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the ACA is mandatory as it fixes the date of commencement of arbitration, which is essential for determining limitation periods and the applicable law. However, merely because such a notice was not issued to certain persons who are parties to the arbitration agreement does not denude the arbitral tribunal of its jurisdiction to implead them as parties during the arbitral proceedings.
The purpose of an application under Section 11 is for the court to appoint an arbitrator, so as to enable dispute resolution through arbitration when the appointment procedure in the agreement fails. The court only undertakes a limited and prima facie examination into the existence of the arbitration agreement and its parties at this stage. Hence, merely because a court does not refer a certain party to arbitration in its order does not denude the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal from impleading them during the arbitral proceedings.
The relevant consideration to determine whether a person can be made a party before the arbitral tribunal is if such a person is a party to the arbitration agreement. The arbitral tribunal must determine this jurisdictional issue in an application under Section 16 by examining whether a non-signatory is a party to the arbitration agreement as per Section 7 of the ACA.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Respondent nos. 2 and 3 are parties to the arbitration agreement in Clause 40 of the LLP Agreement despite being non-signatories. Their conduct is in accordance with and in pursuance of the terms of the LLP Agreement, and hence, they can be made parties to the arbitral proceedings.
The arbitral tribunal has the power to implead these parties as respondents during the proceedings while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 16 of the ACA and as per the kompetenz-kompetenz principle.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the present appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi dated 08.07.2024 in Arb. A. (Comm.) 24/2024, and directed that respondent nos. 2 and 3 be impleaded as parties before the arbitral tribunal.
The proceedings must be continued from the stage of the arbitral tribunal's order dated 15.02.2024. Considering that the claim was filed in 2022, the Court requested the arbitral tribunal to complete the hearings and pass its award as expeditiously as possible.
No order as to costs was made.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an arbitration petition filed by the appellant against respondent no. 1 and 2, seeking a sum of Rs. 1,18,48,069/- along with interest. The dispute arises from transactions undertaken in respondent no. 2's account, for which respondent no. 1 was jointly and severally liable.
The adjustment of accounts on 05.03.2001 is at the center of the case, which was done without written authorization as per the arbitral tribunal's findings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argues that the arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction to decide on respondent no. 1's liability based on an oral contract that he would be jointly and severally liable for transactions undertaken in respondent no. 2's account.
The High Court is also criticized for incorrectly exercising its jurisdiction under Section 37, reappreciating evidence and examining the merits of the award, which it should not have done.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There are two key observations made by the court:
- The adjustment of accounts on 05.03.2001 was in accordance with BSE Bye-laws and SEBI Guidelines, making it a valid transaction.
- The arbitral tribunal's findings were not liable to be set aside on grounds of perversity or patent illegality.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court sets aside the impugned order of the High Court in Appeal No. 126/2006 and allows the present appeal. As a consequence, the arbitral award dated 26.02.2004 is upheld in its entirety, making respondent no. 1 jointly and severally liable along with respondent no. 2 to pay the appellant the arbitral sum of Rs. 1,18,48,069/- along with interest.

The case involves a criminal proceeding against the appellant under Section 420 of the IPC. The appeal is filed to quash the impugned proceedings.
Multiple FIRs have been registered over a period of time, and it is alleged that the registration of these cases is motivated by personal vengeance or private grudge.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in this case are based on the principles of law regarding frivolous or vexatious proceedings. The court has to look into the FIR closely and with care when challenged on grounds that the prosecution is manifestly frivolous or vexatious.
The court also relies on the principle that vicarious liability of office bearers would arise only if there is a provision in the statute, and the complainant must make requisite allegations to attract such provisions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It is observed by the court that whenever an accused comes before the court invoking inherent powers or extraordinary jurisdiction to get the FIR or criminal proceedings quashed on grounds of being manifestly frivolous or vexatious, the court owes a duty to look into the FIR with care and closely.
In frivolous or vexatious proceedings, the court must consider multiple attending circumstances emerging from the record of the case, in addition to averments made in the FIR/complaint.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court unhesitatingly concludes that this is a fit case for allowing the appeal and quashing the impugned criminal proceedings instituted against the appellant for offences under Section 420 of the IPC. Accordingly, Criminal Case No. 7489 of 2002 arising out of Crime No. 13 of 1998 pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad is quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the acquittal of respondents in a criminal appeal related to kidnapping and murder. The incident involved the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Shri H.L. Khera, the then General Manager, HMT Watch Factory, Srinagar. The prosecution's case centered around the confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2) recorded by Shri A.K. Suri.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* Rejection of the confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2) as it was not accepted by the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate and was sent directly to the Special Court, which is an infraction of the statute.
* The procedural safeguards for recording confessional statements were not followed in this case.
* The atmosphere in which the confessional statement was recorded was not a "free atmosphere" as it was done in a BSF camp or JIC where the accused would generally be under duress.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The Legislature had reposed great faith in the fairness and uprightness of higher police officials in granting them the power to record confessional statements, but this case shows that such powers were abused.
* The investigation and trial unfolded in a manner where truth and justice remained elusive for both the victims and accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
* The Special Court had acquitted the respondents correctly as there was no error or infirmity in their view.
* There was no plausible alternative view possible, and consequently, there was no merit in the criminal appeal which was dismissed accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the summoning order of accused Nos. 2 and 5 in a criminal case. The alleged incident occurred between 1999-2000, and accused Nos. 1, 3, and 4 have since passed away. Accused No. 2 superannuated in 2015 and is now 71 years old, while accused No. 5 retired in 2020 and is now 64 years old.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the learned VII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate erred in taking cognizance of the alleged offences against the accused persons without the requisite sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and Section 170 of the Police Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that a mere excess or overreach in the performance of official duty does not disentitle a public servant from statutory protection mandated by law. The safeguard of obtaining prior sanction from the competent authority cannot be rendered nugatory merely because the acts alleged may have exceeded the strict bounds of official duty.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the appeal deserves to succeed, and accordingly allowed it. The impugned order dated 17.03.2021 passed by the High Court in Criminal Petition No. 4512 of 2020 is hereby set aside. Consequently, Criminal Petition No. 4512 of 2020 stands allowed. As a result, the summoning order dated 07.05.2016 passed by the learned VII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru against accused Nos. 2 and 5, as well as the order dated 11.06.2020 passed by the learned LXI City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru City in affirming the same are hereby quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006. The MSEFC (Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council) is responsible for settling disputes between micro and small enterprises and their suppliers or buyers. The question of maintainability of writ petitions against orders/awards passed by MSEFC acting as an arbitral tribunal or conciliator arises.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are centered around the interpretation of Section 18 of the MSMED Act read with Section 80 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (A&C) Act, which deals with the appointment of arbitrators. The petitioner's contention is that MSEFC members who undertake conciliation proceedings cannot act as arbitrators themselves.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case highlight the divergence of opinion among judges regarding the maintainability of writ petitions against orders/awards passed by MSEFC. Several cases, including Shyam Kishore (supra) and Govind Parameswar Nair (supra), have attempted to find a solution to provide support in cases involving extreme hardship.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the case directs the Registry to place the papers before the Chief Justice for the constitution of a larger Bench of five Judges to consider the following questions:
(i) Whether the ratio in M/s India Glycols Limited (supra) completely bars or prohibits maintainability of the writ petition against any order/award of MSEFC.
(ii) If the bar/prohibition is not absolute, when and under what circumstances will the principle/restriction of adequate alternative remedy not apply?
(iii) Whether MSEFC members who undertake conciliation proceedings can themselves act as arbitrators of the arbitral tribunal in terms of Section 18 of the MSMED Act read with Section 80 of the A&C Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a peaceful protest by the appellants, who were accused of using abusive language and violating Section 499 of the IPC. The appellants' case falls within the exception to Section 499, and their peaceful protest is protected under Article 19(1)(a), (b), and (c) of the Constitution.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the appellants include:

*   Their peaceful protest was orderly and did not use any abusive language.
*   The criminal proceedings against them would be an abuse of process if allowed to continue.
*   Peaceful pamphleteering is a form of communication protected under the first amendment in the United States, and similar principles should apply in India.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court made several observations, including:

*   The distinction between peaceful protest and abusive language is crucial in determining whether the appellants' actions were lawful or not.
*   Section 499 of the IPC must be interpreted in light of Article 19(1)(a), (b), and (c) of the Constitution to ensure that fundamental rights are protected.
*   The State has a duty to balance the rights of citizens with the need to maintain public order, but this must be done without infringing on constitutional guarantees.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order. The complaint in CC No. 2042/SS/2016 was quashed and set aside, along with the order issuing summons to the appellants under Section 500 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case deals with the interpretation of Sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court is required to answer two questions:

    (i) Whether a spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act can seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the 1955 Act?

    (ii) Whether, even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, it can grant maintenance pendente lite under Section 24 pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act.

The case involves examples of a wife whose first marriage is subsisting inducing another man to marry her and a daughter getting married to her father.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The court considers various arguments, including:

    The interpretation of Sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
    The discretion of the court in granting maintenance pendente lite under Section 24
    The consideration of the conduct of the parties when deciding on the grant of relief under Section 25
    Examples given by the respondents to illustrate potential absurd results if Section 25 is applied in certain situations
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court makes several observations, including:

    The power of a matrimonial Court to grant interim maintenance in pending proceedings seeking a decree contemplated under the 1955 Act
    The conditions for applicability of Section 24, which require there to be a proceeding under the 1955 Act pending and the court must come to a conclusion that either the wife or the husband has no independent income sufficient for her or his support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding
    The discretionary nature of the grant of relief under both Sections 24 and 25, which requires consideration of the conduct of the parties
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court answers the questions as follows:

    (i) A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the 1955 Act. However, whether such a relief can be granted always depends on the facts of each case and the conduct of the parties.

    (ii) Even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act, the court is not precluded from granting maintenance pendente lite provided the conditions mentioned in Section 24 are satisfied.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a marital dispute between the appellant-husband and the respondent-wife. The husband had filed an application under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India to dissolve their marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Court observed that the impounding of the husband's passport under Section 10 of the Passport Act, 1967 was carried out without granting him an opportunity to be heard. The Court relied on the principles of natural justice and held that the act of impounding the passport was illegal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court include:
* Impounding a person's passport without giving them an opportunity to be heard is a clear violation of the principles of natural justice.
* The impounding of passports or issuance of 'Red Corner Notice' should not be a routine, especially in cases involving persons who are ordinarily residing out of India (Reference: Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P.)
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court's judgment includes:
* Quashing and setting aside the judgments/orders dated 15th September, 2022 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Howrah and 25th January, 2023 passed by the High Court.
* Dissolving the marriage between the appellant-husband and the respondent-wife on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
* Closing all criminal cases/DV Act complaints and civil cases pending between the respondent and the appellant's family members.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the approval of a resolution plan for a company (CD) by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appellant, which is a statutory body and a secured creditor, had not been served notice of the meeting of the Committee of Creditors (COC) and its proceedings were ex parte. The resolution plan did not meet all the parameters laid down in sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) read with Regulations 37 and 38 of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) Regulations, 2016.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>

- The non-service of notice to the appellant for the meeting of the COC and its proceedings being ex parte.
- The resolution plan projecting the appellant as one who did not submit its claim despite having submitted it.
- The resolution plan not meeting all the parameters laid down in sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the IBC read with Regulations 37 and 38 of the CIRP Regulations, 2016.
</ARGUMENTS>

- The NCLT did not take note of the fact that the appellant had not been served notice for the meeting of the COC and its proceedings were ex parte.
- The resolution plan did not meet all the parameters laid down in sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the IBC read with Regulations 37 and 38 of the CIRP Regulations, 2016.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a conviction of the respondent-accused for an offense against 'V', a minor female. The case was initially registered in 1986 and went through various appeals and judgments before reaching the Supreme Court.
The prosecution case relied on the testimony of several witnesses, including PW-14, who deposed that the injury caused to 'V' could not have been caused by a nail or an all-pin. The medical evidence also supported the prosecution's case.
The defense attempted to discredit the evidence of the Doctor by suggesting that he had given his findings influenced by a bribe, but this was unsubstantiated by the record.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the contradictions in the statement made in the FIR and the deposition in Court were not material enough to discredit the witness's statement.
The defense argued that the discrepancy between the statements made in the FIR and the deposition in Court was significant and should lead to a reversal of the conviction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the purpose of cross-examination is to discredit the witness or elicit facts favorable to the other party. However, in this case, none of these criteria were met.
The court also noted that evidence from other witnesses and medical records supported the prosecution's case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment of acquittal entered by the High Court and restoring the judgment of conviction returned by the Sessions Judge. The respondent-accused was directed to surrender before the competent authority within four weeks from the date of the judgment to serve out the sentence as awarded by the learned Trial Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a challenge to the orders passed by the Tribunal, which assumed jurisdiction and gave directions regarding environmental concerns.
No substantial question relating to environment had arisen, nor was there any violation of enactments specified in Schedule-I alleged.
The Tribunal's assumption of jurisdiction and giving of directions were deemed untenable in law.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the Tribunal had committed a gross error by assuming jurisdiction and giving directions without substantial questions relating to environment arising.
They contended that there was no violation of any enactments specified in Schedule-I, making the Tribunal's assumption of jurisdiction and directions legally untenable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The importance of sustainable development in maintaining a symbiotic balance between rights to environment and development was highlighted.
The concept of "sustainable development" was treated as an integral part of "life" under Article 21.
Inter generational equity, public trust doctrine, and precautionary principle were mentioned as inseparable ingredients of environmental jurisprudence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Tribunal's orders were set aside due to lack of jurisdiction and being legally untenable.
The Appellants' appeals stood allowed accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) and VCL (a company) regarding the validity of a disgorgement order dated 28.09.2018. The Tribunal had set aside this order, and the matter reached the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
SEBI argued that the disgorgement order was valid and should not have been set aside by the Tribunal. It also contended that the Tribunal's direction to award costs of ₹2,00,000/- each to VCL and other entities was unjustified.
The appellants (VCL and others) argued that the disgorgement order was unsustainable in law as it was barred by the principle of res judicata/constructive res judicata.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that SEBI's approach to dealing with the matter was laidback and indolent, which did not augur well for a statutory body responsible for protecting investors and regulating the securities market.
The court noted that only 4 entities out of 22 had filed appeals against the disgorgement order, but this did not affect the validity of the order as it was barred by the principle of res judicata/constructive res judicata.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed Civil Appeal No. 7941 of 2019 and set aside the judgment dated 02.08.2019 passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai, in Appeal No. 44 of 2019.
The court held that the disgorgement order dated 28.09.2018 was unsustainable in law as it was barred by the principle of res judicata/constructive res judicata.
However, the direction to award costs of ₹2,00,000/- each to VCL and other entities was unjustified on facts.
The court also set aside the direction of the Tribunal to mulct SEBI with exorbitant costs payable to the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioner, MOHD. TAHIR HUSSAIN, sought special leave to appeal against the grant of bail by the Trial Court in a criminal case.
The petitioner's application for interim bail was allowed by the Supreme Court on January 22, 2025.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner had been wrongly denied bail and that there were no reasonable grounds to deny him bail.
The respondent (State of NCT of Delhi) opposed the petition, citing concerns about the potential misuse of interim bail for electoral purposes.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court noted that the grant of interim bail was not a conclusive opinion on the merits of the underlying bail application or the main case before the Trial Court.
The Court observed that the judgment was specific to this case and should not be taken as a precedent for similar cases in the future.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the petitioner's special leave petition (Criminal) and modified the Impugned Judgment pro tanto, granting interim bail to the petitioner.
However, the Court emphasized that its decision was specific to this case and should not be cited as a precedent for similar cases in the future.
The Court also cautioned against the potential misuse of interim bail for electoral purposes, noting that a Pandora's Box could be opened if such releases were made too freely.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation and evolution of Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. in India. The facts are not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a case related to the misuse of invocation of powers by Magistrates.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments made include:
- A stage has come where applications under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C. are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the complainant who seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate.
- In an appropriate case, the learned Magistrate would be well advised to verify the truth and also verify the veracity of the allegations.
- Prior to the filing of a petition under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C., there have to be applications under Sections 154(1) and 154(3)Cr.P.C..
- The requirement of an affidavit would deter persons from casually invoking the authority of the Magistrate, under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C.. If the affidavit is found to be false, the person would be liable for prosecution in accordance with law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court include:
- The misuse of invocation of powers by unscrupulous litigants for achieving ulterior motives has been a recurring issue.
- Applications under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C. are often filed in a routine manner without taking any responsibility, only to harass certain persons.
- A number of cases related to fiscal sphere, matrimonial disputes/family disputes, commercial offences, medical negligence cases, corruption cases, and abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution have been filed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed is:
- The appeal succeeds, and the impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. The order passed by the Magistrate directing police investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. is also set aside.
- Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a complaint filed against the appellant, who is accused of carrying out a demolition as part of her official duties as District Town Planner. The first respondent, who is the complainant, had put up construction that was allegedly irregular and the appellant carried out the demolition under orders from superior authorities. An application for regularization of the construction was pending before another department.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's counsel argued that the act of demolition was within the scope and ambit of the appellant's authority as District Town Planner, and that there was a correlation between the act of demolition and the discharge of official duties. The counsel also argued that the mere pendency of an application for regularization before another department would not have been an impediment for carrying out the demolition.
The first respondent's counsel contended that the appellant had no authority to demolish the construction when an application for regularisation was pending, but this argument was rejected by the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the first respondent should have sought sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of the CrPC in this case. Since the same was not done, it vitiated the initiation of the criminal proceeding against the appellant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court allowed the petition filed by the appellant seeking quashing of the summoning order dated 20.11.2014, and consequently all steps taken by the Trial Court pursuant to the said summoning order were also quashed. The court observed that the initiation of the complaint itself was non est since there was no prior order of sanction passed under Section 197 of the CrPC.
The appeals were allowed and disposed of in the aforesaid terms, with liberty reserved for the first respondent to take steps in accordance with law and seek an order of sanction.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioner, a former Judge of the High Court, had held judicial office for at least ten years and was also a member of the Bar for over fourteen years and eight months prior to his appointment as a Judge of the High Court. He retired from service on 26 August 2002.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's pensionary payments were not computed with the benefit of an addition of ten years of service, which is applicable to Judges appointed from the Bar. The Union of India argued that this addition should not be made to Judges who were former District Judges.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Not available
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the principle enunciated in Union of India vs Justice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg applies equally to Judges appointed from the district judiciary. The petitioner was entitled to an addition of ten years of service, which would result in his pensionary payments being recomputed accordingly. However, the maximum basic pension payable to a Judge of the High Court (Rs 13,50,000 per annum) shall continue to apply to the petitioner. The difference in pensionary payments due to the petitioner shall be computed with effect from the date of his retirement and paid over by 31 March 2025.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involved a complaint under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The complainant was a student in higher secondary school who alleged that he was pressured by the accused teacher not to lodge any report. The accused and the complainant later compromised the case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case were based on the power of the High Court under Section 482, Cr. P.C. to quash proceedings based on compromise. The High Court relied on Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab (2012) and Laxmi Narayan Bajrang vs. State of U.P. (2018). However, the Supreme Court disagreed with the High Court's decision and held that the power under Section 482, Cr. P.C. cannot be used to quash proceedings based on compromise if it is in respect of heinous offences which are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court were critical of the High Court's decision to quash the proceedings based solely on the compromise between the accused and the complainant. The court noted that the accused was a teacher and the incident allegedly occurred in a higher secondary school, which cannot be described as an offence purely private in nature and having no serious impact on society. The Supreme Court also relied on the object and purpose of enacting the POCSO Act to reject the High Court's decision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed the impugned order dated 04.02.2022 of the High Court in S.B.C.R.M.P. No.1348/2022, and set aside the order quashing the FIR No.6/2022 and all further proceedings pursuant thereto. The court directed that the FIR No.6/2022, investigation, and criminal proceedings be proceeded with against the accused in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Rule 19, which deals with the imposition of penalty for certain offenses. The appellants were charged under Rule 19 as it existed before its amendment on March 29, 2011. The issue at hand is whether the amended Rule 19 can be applied retrospectively to pending proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The single Judge and Division Bench had adopted different approaches to resolve this issue. However, both approaches were found to be incorrect by the Supreme Court. 
- The single Judge's approach was limited in that it considered the amendment as a repeal of the existing law.
- The Division Bench held that the levy of penalty is substantive law and cannot operate retrospectively.
The Supreme Court rejects these approaches and instead seeks to understand the purpose and object of the laws, keeping in mind their governing and regulatory role.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the amended Rule 19 only mollifies the rigor of the law by reducing the penalty from four times the duty to the value of the duty. Therefore, Article 20(1) does not apply, as it only prohibits imposing a penalty greater than the one in force at the time of the commission of the offense.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allows the appeals and sets aside the judgment of the Division Bench. It holds that the penalty to be imposed on the appellants will be based on Rule 19 as substituted on March 29, 2011. There shall be no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the recovery of loans by State Financial Corporations under various Acts, including the Haryana Revenue Recovery Act and the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. The question arises whether these corporations have an additional right to recover amounts due beyond the civil remedies available.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented in support of the additional right:

* The object of the respective Acts is to enable speedy recovery of money, which justifies the classification and conferment of such rights on State Financial Corporations.
* The existence of other rights, including the right to file a suit, does not negate the additional right granted under these Acts.

Arguments presented against the additional right:

* The statutory bar on recovery of electricity dues after the limitation period provided under Section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003 may have an implication on civil remedies.
* However, it was held that the statute of limitation only bars a remedy, while the right to recover the loan through any other suitable manner remains untouched.

Arguments from previous cases:

* In V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra), it was noted that the existence of the right to refund under Section 70(3) of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act does not determine the issue.
* The decision in Deep Chand (supra) upheld the Constitutionality of a similar Act, considering its object to enable speedy recovery of money.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations from previous cases:

* The applicability of V.R. Kalliyanikutty (supra) to Section 56(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003 was considered in K.C. Ninan v. Kerala State Electricity Board (2023 INSC 560).
* It was noted that the power to initiate proceedings to recover electricity dues is independent of the power to disconnect electrical supply.

The case involves an appeal by a statutory body against the approval of a resolution plan by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appellant claimed that it had not been served notice of the meeting of the Creditors' Committee (COC), and the entire proceedings up to the stage of approval of the resolution plan were ex parte. Additionally, the appellant argued that it was a secured creditor, but the resolution plan projected it as one who did not submit its claim.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the analysis of the case, the following can be inferred:

* The appellant argued that the NCLT erred in approving the resolution plan without considering the rights and interests of the appellant as a secured creditor.
* The respondent (the resolution applicant) may have argued that the resolution plan was feasible and viable, and that it had provisions for approvals required and the timeline for the same.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations can be made based on the analysis of the case:

* The NCLT did not consider the rights and interests of the appellant as a secured creditor in approving the resolution plan.
* The entire proceedings up to the stage of approval of the resolution plan were ex parte, which is not in accordance with the principles of natural justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the order dated 24.11.2022 passed by the NCLT approving the resolution plan. The order dated 04.08.2020 passed by the NCLT was also set aside. The resolution plan was sent back to the COC for re-submission after satisfying the parameters set out by the Code.

The case involves the imposition of stamp duty on insurance policies by the state government of Rajasthan. The appellants, who are insurers, had purchased India Insurance Stamps from outside the state due to the unavailability of these stamps within the state. They challenged the orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004, which directed them to pay stamp duty as per the rates prescribed by the Parliament under Entry 91 of List I.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:

* The Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 applies to the present case.
* The state legislature has legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III, as per the rate prescribed by the Parliament under Entry 91 of List I.
* For the execution of insurance policies within the state of Rajasthan, the appellants are bound to purchase India Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state of Rajasthan.

The respondents, who are the state government and other authorities, argued that:

* The orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004 are valid and should be enforced.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:

* The High Court had failed to consider sub-section (4) of Section 3A of the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952, which excludes instruments under Entry 91, List I from the application of Section 3A.
* The appellants had made every endeavour to purchase the stamp from within the state but were unable to do so due to the letter by the department and the lack of mechanism for payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability of insurance stamps.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

* The Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 applies to the present case.
* The state legislature has legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III, as per the rate prescribed by the Parliament under Entry 91 of List I.
* For the execution of insurance policies within the state of Rajasthan, the appellants are bound to purchase India Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state of Rajasthan.

The court also directed that the state government shall not demand and collect the stamp duty as per the orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and six accused individuals. The NIA had submitted a chargesheet against them under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The High Court had granted bail to the accused, but the NIA challenged this decision in the Supreme Court.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The NIA argued that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the accusations against the accused were prima facie true. They pointed out that the accused had a previous history of criminal offenses and that the alleged offenses under UAPA carried severe punishment. The NIA also argued that the High Court's decision to grant bail was illegal and perverse.
The accused, on the other hand, relied on various Supreme Court decisions that had granted bail in similar cases under UAPA.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that national security is of paramount importance and that any act in aid to terrorist activities is liable to be restricted. The court also noted that the UAPA was enacted to provide effective prevention of certain unlawful activities and to impose reasonable restrictions on civil liberties.
The court further observed that it should strike a balance between the civil liberties of the accused, human rights of the victims, and the compelling interest of the state in counter-terrorism enactments.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's decision to grant bail to the accused. The court held that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the accusations against the accused were prima facie true, and therefore, the mandate contained in the proviso to Section 43(D)(5) of UAPA would be applicable for not releasing them on bail.
The court directed the Special Court to proceed with the trial as expeditiously as possible without being influenced by any of the observations made in the order.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the issue of reporting conditions in Indian legal proceedings. The court is considering whether the reporting conditions imposed by a trial judge are directory or mandatory.
The specific case being referred to involves an individual who was directed to report to the police at a particular time, and there is some controversy over whether this direction was legally valid.
Other cases referenced in the judgment provide additional context on how courts have interpreted the requirements of reporting conditions in various jurisdictions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court's analysis begins with an examination of the relevant legal provisions that govern reporting conditions. The court notes that the relevant section does not explicitly state whether reporting conditions are directory or mandatory.
In analyzing previous cases, the court observes that there is a divide between courts that consider reporting conditions to be directory (requiring the judge's discretion) and those that consider them to be mandatory (requiring strict adherence).
The court ultimately concludes that reporting conditions should be treated as directory, subject to the trial judge's discretion.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judgment references several previous cases in which courts have interpreted the requirements of reporting conditions differently.
While some courts have held that reporting conditions are mandatory, others have considered them to be directory, leaving room for judicial discretion.
In one case cited by the court (M/S SJS Gold Pvt. Ltd.), a writ petition was filed against an order directing a person to report to the police at a particular time. The court ruled in favor of the petitioner, holding that reporting conditions are directory and subject to the trial judge's discretion.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment concludes by affirming that reporting conditions should be treated as directory, requiring the trial judge's discretion in each case.
The judges emphasize the importance of considering the specific circumstances and context in which reporting conditions are imposed.
In the case at hand, the court notes that the direction to report was not accompanied by any explanation or justification, potentially indicating an abuse of judicial power.
However, given the ambiguity surrounding the relevant section, the court ultimately concludes that it is within the trial judge's discretion to impose reporting conditions as they see fit.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) developer, the appellant, who was granted the status of a deemed distribution licensee by the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC). However, the APTEL directed the APERC to consider the appellant's compliance with Rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules and Regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations. The TSERC upheld this direction and also imposed a condition that the promoters infuse an additional capital of Rs. 26.90 crore.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but it can be inferred from the judgment that:

* The appellant argued that being a SEZ developer does not ipso facto confer upon them the status of a deemed licensee without any scrutiny and without being under any requirement to apply.
* The TSERC relied on Regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations to enforce the applicability of Rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules, which the appellant argued is flawed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The language of Regulation 12 merits careful scrutiny and it imposes the burden of complying with regulation 12 only on those applicants who come within the purview of regulations 4 to 11.
* The TSERC's reliance on Regulation 49 of the 2013 Regulations to enforce the applicability of Regulation 12 appears to be flawed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:

* Being a SEZ developer does not ipso facto confer upon the appellant the status of a deemed licensee without any scrutiny and without being under any requirement to apply; it is required to make an application in accordance with the 2013 Regulations.
* The condition stipulated in Rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules, as imposed by the TSERC, is not justified and contrary to the statutory scheme.
* The judgments and orders of the TSERC and the APTEL are set aside to this extent.
* The order of the TSERC, which grants the status of a deemed licensee to the appellant, is modified to exclude the condition that its promoters infuse an additional capital of Rs. 26.90 crore.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a complaint conveyed by the District Magistrate, Ramban to the Special Judge, NIA on 20.09.2019. The investigation was completed with the filing of the chargesheet on 25.09.2019. However, there was an omission caused by the appellant in seeking appropriate authorization or empowerment as mandated under Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the defense (appellant) argued that there is no need for getting the appropriate sanction or empowerment as mandated under Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989, citing the transition to CrPC, 1973.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court of Calcutta's decision in Nibaran Chandra (supra) was considered by the court. The court observed that while an investigation could continue after its initiation under CrPC, 1989, by way of the application of CrPC, 1973, it cannot be stated that even for a case where there was a clear non-compliance of the former, it can be ignored by the application of the latter. 
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal in part, setting aside the impugned judgment insofar as it confirms the judgment of the Special Judge, NIA, in not taking cognizance for the offence punishable under Section 120-B of the RPC, 1989. The court gave liberty to the appellant to comply with the mandate of Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989, by seeking appropriate authorization or empowerment as the case may be. If such a compliance is duly made, then the Trial Court shall undertake the exercise of taking cognizance and proceed further with the trial in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an application for leave to file a replication in an election petition. The returned candidate had filed a written statement, and the election petitioner sought to respond with additional facts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the election petitioner argued that the returned candidate's written statement contained new facts that required a reply.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court found that the replication sought to explain the averments made in the written statement and did not introduce any new material facts or a new cause of action. The court therefore granted leave to file the replication, upholding the discretionary jurisdiction of the High Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court on May 8, 2024. There was no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals against the denial of anticipatory bail by Special Courts. The accused were not arrested under Section 19 of the PMLA till a complaint was filed under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the applicants sought anticipatory bail and the Special Courts denied their applications. The appellants argued that they should be granted anticipatory bail as they had not been arrested under Section 19 of the PMLA.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
- After cognizance is taken of the offence punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA based on a complaint under Section 44(1)(b), the ED and its officers are powerless to exercise power under Section 19 to arrest a person shown as an accused in the complaint.
- If the ED wants custody of the accused who appears after service of summons for conducting further investigation in the same offence, the ED will have to seek custody of the accused by applying to the Special Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is as follows:
- The appeals succeed, and the court sets aside the impugned orders declining to grant anticipatory bail.
- Warrants issued against the appellants shall stand cancelled subject to certain conditions: 
  *   The appellants shall appear before the concerned Special Court within one month from today and file an undertaking that they shall regularly and punctually appear before the Special Court on the dates fixed unless their appearance is specifically exempted by the exercise of powers under Section 205 of the CrPC.
  *   The appellants shall furnish bonds in accordance with Section 88 of the CrPC to the satisfaction of the Special Court within one month from today.
- If the appellants make compliance as aforesaid within one month from today, the warrants issued against them shall be cancelled. However, if they fail to do so, it will be open for the Special Courts to issue warrants against them.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves four accused persons, Waseem, Nazim, Aslam, and Abubakar, who are charged with a double murder. They have been in custody for less than three years. The prosecution has filed cross-FIRs against the complainant, Smt. Saeeda Begum (w/o Niyaz Ahmad mother of Waseem). A protest petition has been filed by the complainant, and an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C has been registered.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the accused persons do not deserve bail as they have remained in custody for less than three years. The prosecution also pointed out infirmities in the impugned orders, including the fact that the accused persons have filed cross-FIRs against the complainant and an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C has been registered.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that all the four accused persons have remained in custody for less than three years. The court also noted that the prosecution has pointed out infirmities in the impugned orders, including the fact that the accused persons have filed cross-FIRs against the complainant and an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C has been registered.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court quashed and set aside all the four impugned orders. The court directed the respondents to surrender within two weeks from the date of passing of this order. The court clarified that the observations made above are limited to examining the infirmities in the impugned orders and shall not be treated as an opinion on the merits of the matter which is still pending trial.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a FIR (First Information Report) under the Uttar Pradesh Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. The FIR was registered against several individuals, including the appellants, for allegedly committing gangsterism and anti-social activities.
The complainant(s)/informant(s) in the three CCs have resorted to their remedies under criminal law, and a fourth CC has also been lodged against the appellants.
There is no mention of any instance, post-registration of the said CCs, of the appellants implementing/acting on the alleged threats.
The complainant(s)/informant(s) have also resorted to civil proceedings where required.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the State argued that the FIR was justified and that the provisions of the Act were applicable in this case.
The court, however, observed that the resort to the Act by the State seemed premature and uncalled for.
The appellants' counsel argued that there was no sufficient evidence to support the allegations made against them.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the complainant(s)/informant(s) had resorted to their remedies under criminal law, which suggested that they were seeking redressal through the legal system.
The court also observed that there was no mention of any instance where the appellants implemented/acted on the alleged threats post-registration of the CCs.
The court noted that the complainant(s)/informant(s) had resorted to civil proceedings where required, which suggested that they were seeking additional remedies through the civil system.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The FIR namely CC No.0092/2023 stands quashed by the court.
The Impugned Judgment is set aside.
Proceedings consequential to CC No.0092/2023 stand effaced.

The respondent was granted bail in a case registered under sections 364, 302, 201 & 34 of IPC. 
The respondent has been acquitted in one case and enlarged on bail in two other cases.
The respondent has also been granted anticipatory bail in another case.
The respondent's bail conditions have not been violated.

The state sought to set aside the order granting bail, citing concerns that the respondent may pose a threat to witnesses.
The respondent's counsel argued that the respondent had been acquitted or granted bail in all cases mentioned by the state.
The respondent's counsel also pointed out that the state had not sought to cancel the respondent's bail despite being aware of these cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There was no overwhelming material on record to set aside the order granting bail.
The prosecution would be at liberty to seek cancellation of the bail if any conditions are violated.
The jurisdictional court should consider any application for cancellation of bail on its own merits, without being influenced by earlier observations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal stands dismissed. The court observed that interference was not warranted in this case.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the title to a piece of land, with multiple parties involved. The original judgment and order were passed by the Division Bench (original), but the High Court later set aside this decision in an impugned order. The Supreme Court is now reviewing this matter.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented include:
- The High Court exceeded its review and contempt jurisdiction when it set aside the original judgment and order.
- The impugned order was based on a misunderstanding of the law and facts, leading to an unjust decision.
- The parties involved should be allowed to approach a competent forum to determine the title to the subject land and other contentious issues.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:
- Suppression of material facts can amount to a fraud on the court.
- A writ court is a court of equity, requiring parties to approach with clean hands.
- The High Court's decision was based on a statutory bar that does not apply in this case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
- The appeals succeed and are allowed.
- The impugned order is set aside, and the original judgment and order of the Division Bench (original) is restored.
- The parties shall bear their own costs.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The State Bar Councils (SBCs) and the Bar Council of India (BCI) were charging excess enrolment fees from advocates, in violation of Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act, 1961. The SBCs were also demanding payment of fees other than the stipulated enrolment fee and stamp duty as a pre-condition to enrolment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the SBCs' actions were in contravention of Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 19(1)(g) (right to practice any profession or occupation) of the Constitution. They contended that Section 24(1)(f) specifically lays down the fiscal pre-conditions subject to which an advocate can be enrolled on State rolls, and no additional fees can be demanded by the SBCs.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that the SBCs' actions were violative of Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. The court also noted that the Advocates Welfare Fund Act, 2001 mandates the SBCs to pay annually to the welfare fund an amount equal to twenty per cent of the enrolment fee received by it under Section 24(1)(f).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:

a. The SBCs cannot charge "enrolment fees" beyond the express legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f) as it currently stands;
b. Section 24(1)(f) specifically lays down the fiscal pre-conditions subject to which an advocate can be enrolled on State rolls, and no additional fees can be demanded by the SBCs;
c. The decision of the SBCs to charge fees and charges at the time of enrolment in excess of the legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f) violates Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution; and
d. This decision will have prospective effect, and the SBCs are not required to refund the excess enrolment fees collected before the date of this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the termination of two female judicial officers, Sarita Chaudhary and Aditi Kumar Sharma. The petitioners challenged their termination orders issued by the High Court and the State Government. The petitioners claimed that they were terminated based on frivolous allegations and without considering their medical conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court considered several key arguments, including:
* The insidious patriarchal system that perpetuates indirect discrimination against women in public employment.
* The need for sensitive work environments and guidance for female judicial officers.
* The importance of considering gender as a critical factor in holistic decision-making at certain times and stages of a woman judicial officer's career.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court had erred in acting agnostically to the petitioners' claims, particularly with regards to their insubordination and medical conditions. The court noted that despite reeling from the effects of COVID-19 and a miscarriage, Aditi Kumar Sharma's annual confidential report (ACR) was downgraded based solely on "pendency and disposal."
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the termination orders and reinstated the petitioners in their service with all consequential benefits. The court directed the respondents to declare the probation of the petitioners as on the date their juniors were confirmed, and not to entitle them to any salary from the date of termination till their reinstatement but to calculate monetary benefits notionally for pensionary benefits etc.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals related to the non-execution of decrees in various courts across India. The appellants, decree-holders, sought vacant and peaceful possession of suit properties but faced delays in execution proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court's judgment was set aside by the Supreme Court, which directed all High Courts to ensure that execution petitions are disposed of within six months from the date of filing. The Court also emphasized the need for district judiciary to adhere to this timeline and imposed administrative responsibility on presiding officers.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The mandatory direction in Para 42.12 of Rahul S. Shah (supra) was reiterated, requiring execution proceedings to be completed within six months from the date of filing. The Court also directed all High Courts to collect necessary information from their district judiciary regarding pendency and disposal of execution petitions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment passed by the High Court. The Court ordered that vacant and peaceful possession of suit properties be handed over to the appellants within a period of two months from the date of the order, with the aid of police if necessary.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the prosecution of individuals accused of possessing illicit materials. The court is required to examine whether the police followed the procedure laid down in Section 52A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case revolve around the interpretation and application of Section 52A of the NDPS Act. The court is required to consider whether the police followed the prescribed procedure for handling evidence, including the seizure, storage, and production of the illicit materials.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that substantial compliance with the procedure laid down in Section 52A is sufficient, rather than strict adherence to every detail. However, non-compliance or delayed compliance may lead to an adverse inference against the prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismisses the appeal and holds that even if there are procedural lapses under Section 52A of the NDPS Act, the trial can proceed without hesitation if other material on record inspires confidence regarding the recovery and conscious possession of the contraband. The court also emphasizes that non-compliance or delayed compliance may lead to an adverse inference against the prosecution.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around two Advocates-on-Record, Mr. P.Soma Sundaram and Mr. S.Muthukrishnan, who filed a second Special Leave Petition (Criminal) against an order of the Honorable High Court without disclosing the fact that they had previously filed a first Special Leave Petition (Criminal) against the same order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Advocates tendered unconditional apologies for their actions, stating that the omission was neither wilful nor wanton. They also mentioned that they have an unblemished track record and come from remote villages in Tamil Nadu, where imposing costs or suspending them could be detrimental to their future.
Senior Advocates, Office Bearers of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), and Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) appealed to the court for mercy, requesting that the unconditional apology be accepted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The conduct of the Advocates was considered reprehensible, but due to their unblemished track record and apologies, the court decided to take a lenient view. The court warned them to be careful in not repeating such misconduct in future and directed them to ensure that they appear before all cases where they have entered appearances.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Honorable Judge accepted the unconditional apology tendered by the Advocates, stating that it was honest and genuine. The court also took into account the appeals made by Senior Advocates and Associations for mercy. As a result, the case stands closed, and the Advocates are warned to be careful in future.

The case involves land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The High Court had granted compensation to the landowners at Rs. 1,27,50,976 per acre. However, the State argued that the land in another case (Besco) had change of land use (CLU) permission and the owners there had paid CLU rates.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:
* The appellants (landowners) claimed that they were entitled to higher compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
* The State argued that the land in Besco had change of land use (CLU) permission and the owners there had paid CLU rates. They contended that this should be taken into account while determining the compensation for the appellants.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed:
* That the High Court's judgment was set aside, and the appeals were partly allowed.
* The observation of Justice B.R. Gavai in his judgment: "the landowners shall be paid a sum of Rs. 1,18,37,668/- per acre and statutory benefits under Section 23(1-A), 23(2) & 28 of the LA Act in accordance with law after deducting the amounts already paid."

The judgment reads:
"The landowners shall be paid a sum of Rs. 1,18,37,668/- per acre and statutory benefits under Section 23(1-A), 23(2) & 28 of the LA Act in accordance with law after deducting the amounts already paid."
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the cancellation of an entire selection process conducted by the West Bengal government due to egregious violations and illegalities in the examination process. The selection process was declared null and void, and all appointments made under it were cancelled. However, candidates who were already employed at the time of termination would not be required to refund any payments made to them. Candidates with disabilities would be allowed to continue their employment until a fresh selection process is completed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court's decision was based on the following arguments:
- The examination process had numerous errors and irregularities, including discrepancies in marks allocation and anomalies in the question paper.
- The government failed to investigate these issues despite several complaints being filed.
- The appointments made under this selection process were declared null and void as they were based on an invalid and tainted examination process.
- Candidates with disabilities would not be entitled to the same benefits as those granted to Ms. Soma Das, but would instead receive wages until a fresh selection process is completed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The disabled candidates mentioned in the previous paragraph would be allowed to participate in the fresh selection process, if required, with age relaxation and other concessions.
- Other candidates who are not specifically tainted will also be eligible to participate in the fresh selection process, with appropriate age relaxation.
- A fresh selection process should now be initiated to fill the vacancies.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the impugned judgment cancelling en bloc / entire selection process but made certain modifications in the directions issued by the High Court. The appeals were disposed of in accordance with the terms mentioned above.

The case will also be independently taken up for hearing on 08.04.2025 regarding the direction of investigation by the CBI on the decision to create supernumerary posts.

The case involves the designation of Shri Rishi Malhotra as an advocate-on-record in the Supreme Court. The facts are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that there is a dispute or issue related to his designation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that they are related to the designation of Shri Rishi Malhotra and possibly the rules and regulations governing advocates-on-record in the Supreme Court. The court observes that if any advocate-on-record commits misconduct or is guilty of conduct unbecoming of an advocate-on-record, an action against him as per Rule 10 of Order IV is warranted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court makes several observations regarding the rules and regulations governing advocates-on-record in the Supreme Court. They note that if any advocate-on-record merely lends their name while filing petitions/appeals/counter-affidavits, it may directly impact the quality of justice rendered by the court. The court also observes that there are bottlenecks in filing registration and verification of cases which result in early listing of cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the Registrar (Judicial) to place a copy of the judgment before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India. It is for the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India to consider whether the issues flagged by the court deserve to be considered by a Bench of appropriate strength. The court also directs the Registrar (Judicial) to forward a copy of the judgment to the Secretary-General of the Court with a direction to forward the written submissions made so that necessary remedial steps/action can be taken.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants' shares were transferred to the State Government in 1973. The appellants instituted a suit in 1978 claiming a valuation of Rs.70.50 per share, which was later amended to Rs.874/- per share based on a private valuer's report. However, the High Court and this Court ultimately ordered a valuation of Rs.640/- per share. The respondent agreed to pay a fair valuation for the shares but has yet to make payment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants claimed interest at 18% with quarterly rest or 15% with monthly rest, which was deemed unreasonable by the Court. The appellants' claim of interest was guided by the principle that they should be reasonably compensated for the delay of five decades in receiving payment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The discretion to award interest is well recognized, but its exercise must be guided by equitable considerations. The rate and period of interest cannot be applied mechanically or at an unreasonably high rate without rationale.

<FACTS>
The CMJ University was established under the Chandra Mohan Jha University Act, 2009. The university appointed a Chancellor without following the procedure prescribed under Section 14(1) of the Act. The State Government issued a notification dated 31st March, 2014, dissolving the CMJ University. The appellants challenged the dissolution order in the High Court, and the matter was remanded to the Single Bench by the Division Bench.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the appointment of the Chancellor was valid and that the university had followed the proper procedure. They also contended that the dissolution order was arbitrary and violated the principles of natural justice.

The respondents (State Government) argued that the appointment of the Chancellor was not in accordance with the law and that the university's action was ultra vires. They further contended that the dissolution order was a reasonable exercise of power under the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Division Bench observed that the procedure prescribed under Section 14(1) of the Act for the appointment of the Chancellor was not followed by the CMJ University and, therefore, the appointment was void ab initio. The court also noted that the dissolution order dated 31st March, 2014, had been passed with strict adherence to the procedural requirements outlined under Section 48 of the Act.

The Division Bench further observed that remanding the matter to the Single Bench for reconsideration on merits would be an empty formality, as the decision-making process had already been approved by the higher court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

i. The procedure prescribed under Section 14(1) of the Act for the appointment of the Chancellor was not duly followed by the CMJ University and, therefore, the appointment was void ab initio.

ii. The dissolution order dated 31st March, 2014 had been passed with strict adherence to the procedural requirements outlined under Section 48 of the Act and in compliance with the directions issued by this Court.

iii. The Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in remanding the matter to the learned Single Judge for reconsideration on merits.

iv. The decision of the State Government dated 31st March, 2014, in dissolving the CMJ University is affirmed.

The Civil Appeal No. 9694 of 2024 filed by the appellants is hereby dismissed, and the Civil Appeal No. 9695 of 2024 filed by the State is allowed.

<FACTS>
The case involves an acquisition of land under the Acquisition Act, 2013. The market value of the land is to be computed under Section 26 of the Acquisition Act, 2013. The Commissioner has applied the Collector's Guidelines by using the rate provided for non-converted agricultural land and supplemented this amount by accounting for the assets attached to the land and adding the solatium payable.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, argues that the circle rate is not the baseline or floor rate and is too high. The Commissioner has computed the compensation in accordance with the mandate of the Acquisition Act, 2013, using the market value specified under the Stamp Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The importance of scientifically fixing circle rates and ensuring they reflect the true market value was emphasized. It was noted that public authorities, including state development corporations acquiring land from private individuals, must adhere to the notified circle rate when citizens are required to pay stamp duty on it.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the compensation has been calculated in accordance with the mandate of the Acquisition Act, 2013. The appeals filed by the appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, were dismissed. No reduction in the amount can be granted by applying the theory of deduction. It was left to the Collector's discretion to make adjustments to the market value determined through Section 26(1) if deemed necessary.

The case involves the cancellation of a select list for recruitment to 104 Constables in the Armed Forces Police Force (AFPF). The respondents were selected for appointment but their legitimacy was not granted due to the absence of approval from the Government.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the cancellation of the select list was arbitrary and unjustified. They claimed that there were sufficient materials justifying the cancellation, including a note dated 4th July, 2016 from the PCCF proposing the cancellation of the select list.

The respondents argued that they had no indefeasible or vested right to appointment and therefore could not question any decision adverse to their interest affecting their goal of securing public employment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It is observed that the note dated 4th July, 2016 from the PCCF contained sufficient justification for the cancellation of the select list. The court endorsed the approval of this decision.

The court also noted that the respondents had not been granted legitimacy to the select list by way of an approval from the Government, and therefore their writ petition should not have been allowed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The impugned judgment(s) and order(s) of the High Court stand(s) quashed. The civil appeal stands allowed, without order for costs.

Consequently, the appellants are granted liberty to take forward the process of filling up 104 Constables in the AFPF, in accordance with law, by publishing fresh advertisement. Rules should be framed for the purpose of recruitment and such rules should be uniformly applied to all and sundry.

The respondents, if they choose to apply in pursuance of such advertisement, shall be considered for appointment waiving their age bar as well as waiving insignificant minor deficiencies in physical measurement as well as insignificant requirements of the PET.

<FACTS>
The case involves the validity of an order dated 4th December, 2023, issued by the Superintendent of Police under Section 17 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act). The High Court had quashed this order and restored a FIR in Crime No. 56 of 2003. The appeal was filed against this judgment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented include:
* The High Court erred in coming to the conclusion that the order dated 4th December, 2023, passed by the Superintendent of Police was directly passed under Section 17 of the PC Act, thereby violating the mandatory provisions of the PC Act.
* A preliminary inquiry is not mandatory in every case under the PC Act. If a superior officer is in seisin of a source information report which is both detailed and well-reasoned and such that any reasonable person would be of the view that it prima facie discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, the preliminary inquiry may be avoided.
* Section 17 of the PC Act relates specifically to the investigation process, and not the initial act of registering the FIR, for which it relies on the provisions of the CrPC. Hence, it places limitations on only the investigation; it does not impede the fundamental duty of the law enforcement agency to record and register an FIR for cognizable offences.
* On a harmonious reading of the provisions of the PC Act and the CrPC, it is manifest that the Superintendent of Police is competent to direct the registration of an FIR if he has information about the commission of a cognizable offence, punishable under the PC Act. The former is also competent to simultaneously direct the Deputy Superintendent of Police to register an FIR for the offences under the PC Act, with the understanding that the subsequent investigation will be subject to the restrictions outlined in Section 17 of the PC Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made include:
* The High Court erred in imposing unwarranted administrative frameworks that could potentially incapacitate the law enforcement agencies.
* The Superintendent of Police’s authority to issue a composite order directing registration of the FIR and authorizing the officer to conduct an investigation is valid in the eyes of law. 
* The reasons assigned in the order dated 4th December, 2023 for entrusting the investigation to the Deputy Superintendent of Police are manifest and obvious.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
* The appeal is allowed accordingly.
* The judgment and order dated 4th March, 2024 passed by the High Court of Karnataka in Criminal Writ Petition No. 13460 of 2023 is quashed and set aside.
* The FIR in Crime No. 56 of 2003 pending before the 23rd Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bangalore City is restored.

The case involves a dispute between the AMP Group and the SRG Group regarding an arbitration agreement. The parties were involved in a family arrangement agreement, which included a provision for arbitration in case of disputes. However, the SRG Group claimed that they did not agree to be bound by the arbitration agreement. The AMP Group sought to implead the SRG Group in the arbitration proceedings, but the SRG Group resisted.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The AMP Group argued that the SRG Group had participated in the negotiation and performance of the underlying contract, which included the arbitration agreement. They contended that the SRG Group's participation in the contract was sufficient to bind them to the arbitration agreement. The AMP Group also relied on the decision in Cox and Kings (supra) to argue that the nomenclature of the agreement is not determinative of its character.
The SRG Group argued that they had not agreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement, and therefore, could not be compelled to participate in the arbitration proceedings. They claimed that a dual test needed to be satisfied before they could be compelled to be a party to the arbitration proceedings, i.e., (a) they should have agreed to the underlying contract and (b) they should also have agreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the determination of whether the SRG Group is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement requires a detailed examination of the evidence, which can only be gone into by the Arbitral Tribunal. The Court noted that it should not conduct a mini-trial and delve into contested or disputed questions of fact.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the present petition and appointed Mr. Akil Kureshi (Former Chief Justice, High Court of Rajasthan) to act as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator including other modalities shall be fixed in consultation with the parties. It was made clear that all the rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.

The case involves a writ petition filed by Respondent 1, challenging the shortlisting criteria for Assistant Professor positions. The petitioner had applied for the position but was not shortlisted. The shortlisting criteria included teaching experience and post-doctoral experience.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:
- Respondent 1 argued that the shortlisting criteria were discriminatory and biased towards candidates with more teaching experience, thereby unfairly excluding those with less or no teaching experience.
- The respondents (UGC and appellants) argued that the shortlisting criteria were fair and reasonable, and that teaching experience was a necessary qualification for Assistant Professor positions.
- The Division Bench of the High Court agreed with Respondent 1's arguments and held that the shortlisting criteria were discriminatory and biased.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
- The court noted that while teaching experience was not a mandatory eligibility criterion, it was given undue importance in the shortlisting process.
- The court observed that the Division Bench had erred in appreciating the contentious issues in the proper perspective vis-à-vis the law applicable thereto.
- The court also observed that the Division Bench had failed to seek clarification from the UGC or the appellants regarding the definition of 'post-doctoral experience' and its implications for shortlisting.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:
- The impugned order was set aside, and Respondent 1's writ petition was dismissed.
- The special appeal filed by Respondent 1 challenging the dismissal of her writ petition was also dismissed.
- The review petition filed by Respondent 1 stood dismissed.

The buyer had entered into an agreement with the sellers to purchase a property. The buyer made an advance payment of Rs. 25 lakh but failed to complete the purchase due to some issues. The buyer then filed a suit against the sellers for return of the advance amount.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court examined whether the buyer was 'ready and willing' to perform their part of the agreement, as per Section 57 of the Indian Contract Act. The court held that the buyer's failure to complete the purchase due to some issues made them not 'ready and willing'. Therefore, the sellers were justified in withholding the return of the advance amount.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the trial court had framed an issue as to whether the agreement was true, valid, and enforceable. However, no issue as to maintainability of the suit had been framed. The court clarified that the failure or omission on the part of the trial court to frame an issue on maintainability did not trim the powers of the higher court to examine whether the jurisdictional fact did exist for grant of relief.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were allowed, and the first appellate judgment and decree of the High Court were set aside. The suit instituted by the buyer was dismissed, but the buyer was entitled to return of the advance sum of Rs. 25 lakh by the sellers. If not already returned, the sellers were required to take steps for this within a month from the date. Additionally, any deposit made pursuant to any order of court was also to be returned to the buyer with accrued interest.

<FACTS>
The plaintiff had filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell dated 26.04.1991 in the year 1993 itself. The plaint in the said suit was rejected on 12.01.1998. The plaintiff could have filed a second suit on or before 12.01.2001.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case were based on Order VII Rule 13 of the Code, which deals with the right to file a subsequent suit after the rejection of an earlier suit. It was argued that the plaintiff had obtained the right to file the second suit on 12.01.1998 and had to do so within three years from that date.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the limitation period expired in January, 2001 itself, and the second suit was filed belatedly in the year 2007. The cause of action by then faded and paled into oblivion, and the right to sue stood extinguished.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the second suit was barred under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code, which deals with suits filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation as per Article 113 to the Schedule to the Limitation Act. The court allowed the application filed under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code and set aside the impugned orders of the High Court and the trial court.

<FACTS>
The case involves the jurisdiction of civil courts to try suits based on title to property under the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation. The court is considering a challenge to an order passed by a Civil Judge, Nagaon.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiffs in the suit claimed that the provision in Section 154(1) of the Regulation does not preclude civil courts from adjudicating upon the right to an asset when entitlement is claimed. The High Court had earlier held that the jurisdiction conferred upon Revenue authorities does not prevent civil courts from deciding rights, title, and interest to immovable property.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Gauhati High Court has clarified in previous decisions that the bar created by Section 154(1) does not preclude suits based on title to property from being within the jurisdiction of civil courts. The court also observed that declaration of title to immovable property is outside the purview of Revenue courts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court is accordingly set aside for not being sustainable in law. The order dated 16.05.2014 passed by the Civil Judge, Nagaon is hereby restored.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence and the testimony of eyewitnesses. However, the defense argued that the charge of conspiracy was not substantiated and that there was no direct evidence linking the accused to the crime. The High Court had acquitted several individuals, including Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), and Rajan Tiwari (A-9).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the charge of conspiracy was not established, and thus, the accused who were acquitted under this charge should be given the benefit of doubt. The conviction and sentence awarded to Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) were affirmed by the court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) received a complaint case (No. 51 of 2007) against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The complainants alleged that the banks were charging high interest rates on credit card dues, which was unfair and usurious. The RBI had issued guidelines to regulate the credit card industry, but the banks were not following these guidelines.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents (banks) argued that they were charging interest rates as per the Reserve Bank of India's guidelines. They also stated that the customers were aware of the interest rates and terms and conditions when they applied for a credit card. The RBI supported the banks, stating that there was no material on record to show that any bank had acted contrary to its policy directives.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The National Commission observed that the rate of interest charged by the banks was determined by their financial wisdom and the directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The customers were educated and made aware of their privileges and obligations, including timely payment and levying a penalty on delay. There was no evidence to show that the charging of rates of interest without a standardized rate was usurious or constituted an unfair trade practice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by the Reserve Bank of India, setting aside the final Judgment/Order dated 07.07.2008 passed by the National Commission. The court held that there was no material on record to establish that any bank had acted contrary to the policy directives issued by the RBI.

- The Sessions Court must immediately issue a note, list the disposed-of case on the cause list, and inform the State Public Prosecutor or investigating agency about any pending appeals or special leave petitions after receiving an order from the High Court.
- A warrant for the execution of the death sentence should only be issued after notice has been served to the convict and the directions issued by the Allahabad High Court in the case of People's Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) have been implemented.
- The Sessions Court must consider the court's previous judgment that held that a gap of 15 clear days must be maintained between the date of receipt of the order as well as warrant by the convict and the actual date of execution.

The impugned judgment dated 7th July 2023 in Commercial Appeal no.31 of 2023 is set aside, and Commercial Appeal no.30 of 2023 is restored to the file of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. The parties are under an obligation to appear before the concerned Bench on a specified date.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* The UNCITRAL model will be frustrated if stakeholders do not show restraint and incorporate only legally permissible grounds in petitions under Section 34 and appeals under Section 37.
* Arbitration must become a tool for expeditious, effective, and cost-effective dispute resolution.
* Members of the bar should limit themselves to incorporating only relevant and permissible grounds in petitions under Section 34 and appeals under Section 37.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
* The proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 are being treated as if they are appeals under Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).
* There is a tendency to urge all grounds, which are not available in law, and waste the Court's time.
* This inefficiency makes the arbitral procedure unfair and inefficient.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court passes the following order:
a. The impugned judgment dated 7th July 2023 is set aside.
b. Commercial Appeal no.30 of 2023 is restored to the file of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.

<FACTS>
The case involves an insurance claim filed by the appellant against the respondent insurance company. The appellant's father had taken two insurance policies with the respondent, which were to pay out Rs. 7,50,000 and Rs. 9,60,000 in the event of his death. The respondent rejected the claim on the grounds that the deceased had fraudulently suppressed information about existing insurance policies with other companies.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the respondent had failed to adequately prove the fact that the deceased had fraudulently suppressed information about existing insurance policies. The appellant also pointed out that the respondent's reliance on an incomplete and contradictory table of policies was unjustified.
The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the deceased had indeed suppressed material facts about existing insurance policies, which rendered the two policies null and void.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the burden to prove a fact rests upon the person asserting such a fact. The respondent failed to provide adequate evidence to support their claim of fraudulently suppressed information.
The court also observed that the contra proferentem rule was applicable in this case, which means that any ambiguity in the insurance policy should be interpreted against the insurer.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court set aside the impugned order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) and directed the respondent to make payment of the insurance claim under both policies to the appellant, amounting to Rs. 7,50,000 and Rs. 9,60,000 with interest at the rate of 7% per annum from the date of filing the complaint.
The court also allowed the appeal in terms that the respondent should make payment of the insurance claim as directed above.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between DAMEPL (the petitioner) and the High Court of the state. The arbitral award was made in favor of DAMEPL, but the Division Bench of the High Court set aside the award on grounds of perversity and patent illegality under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. This decision was later overturned by a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court, which resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Division Bench of the High Court held that the arbitral award suffered from perversity and patent illegality, citing the following reasons:
- The arbitral tribunal failed to consider relevant evidence and made an error in calculating the damages.
- The award was contrary to public policy and was not in accordance with the law.
The Supreme Court, while entertaining the Special Leave Petition under Article 136, failed to justify its interference with the well-considered decision of the Division Bench.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It appears that there are differing opinions on the validity of the arbitral award. The Division Bench held the award to be perverse and illegal, while the Supreme Court later overturned this decision. This has caused a miscarriage of justice, as the execution proceedings were allowed to continue despite the High Court's decision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The curative petitions were allowed by the Supreme Court. The parties are restored to their original position as per the Division Bench's judgment. The execution proceedings for enforcing the arbitral award must be discontinued, and the amounts deposited by the petitioner pursuant to the Supreme Court's earlier judgment shall be refunded. Any part of the awarded amount paid by the petitioner due to coercive action is liable to be restored in favor of the petitioner.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCTI0NAL LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE CASE>

<FACTS>
The case involves a legislation (Act) intended to benefit marginalized and impoverished individuals. The court notes that an overwhelming majority of legislations are introduced by the government, with few private member bills being introduced and debated.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The judiciary can and ought to perform two roles: reviewing executive and legislative actions, and facilitating access to justice and effective functioning of constitutional bodies. 
The facilitative role includes directing the executive branch to review the working of statutes and audit statutory impact when a statute has failed to ameliorate conditions for beneficiaries.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that no comprehensive statutory audit has been undertaken, and the legislation's implementation is with the State of Maharashtra. The court also highlights the challenges in carrying the voice of intended beneficiaries to the legislative branch for effective reform.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court requests the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court to constitute a bench to initiate suo motu proceedings for reviewing the working of the statute and identifying the cause of problems indicated. The concerned bench will hear stakeholders, including intended beneficiaries, and consider directing the government to constitute a committee for performance audit of the Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants imported a product called "HSD" (High-Speed Diesel) which was detained by the Customs Authority. The appellants claimed that the product was HSD, while the Customs Authority alleged that it was not. The case went to court, and the High Court ruled in favor of the Customs Authority, quashing the appellants' appeal. The appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the product was HSD based on its appearance, smell, and other characteristics. They also pointed out that the testing facilities for all parameters were not available, which led to uncertainty and doubt in the classification of goods. The respondents (Customs Authority) argued that the product did not meet all the parameters under IS 1460:2005, a Bureau of Indian Standard Specifications.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the testing facilities for all parameters were not available, which led to inconclusive evidence and prolonged litigation. The court also noted that laying down specific parameters without ensuring adequate testing facilities would be meaningless.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, setting aside the impugned common judgment and order dated 20.01.2022 passed in Revenue Tax Appeal No. 297 of 2021, Revenue Tax Appeal No. 298 of 2021, and Revenue Tax Appeal No. 299 of 2021. The court directed the respondents to ensure that proper facilities are made available in the appropriate laboratories for undertaking tests for all parameters or at least for those parameters which the Authorities consider are of essential character to satisfy the "most akin" test.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the efficacy of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in India's electoral system. The court is considering whether to allow the use of EVMs or revert to paper ballots.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it can be inferred that:
* Some parties may have argued that the current EVM system has flaws and should be replaced with a more reliable method.
* Others may have countered that the EVMs have been used successfully for many years and there is no need to change the system.
* The court also seems to consider the issue from a public interest perspective, weighing the potential risks of reverting to paper ballots against the benefits of maintaining the current system.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judge observes that:
* The issue has been previously raised before the court and should be concluded definitively now.
* Any regressive measures to revert to paper ballots or alternative methods should be eschewed unless substantial evidence is presented against the EVMs.
* A critical yet constructive approach, guided by evidence and reason, should be followed to make room for meaningful improvements and ensure the system's credibility and effectiveness.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes that:
* The current system will have to persist with enhancements unless substantial evidence is presented against the EVMs.
* Blindly distrusting any aspect of the system can breed unwarranted skepticism and impede progress.
* A culture of trust and collaboration between citizens, the judiciary, elected representatives, and the electoral machinery should be nurtured to strengthen the foundations of democracy.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellant had claimed 'Mochi' caste, which was validated by the Scrutiny Committee. The Appellant's claim was based on genealogical caste history of their forefathers. The Scrutiny Committee verified that the Appellant belongs to 'Mochi' caste in accordance with Entry 11 of Presidential Order as applicable to Maharashtra.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Respondents argued that interference by this Court would amount to fiddling with the Presidential Order. However, the Appellant's case did not call for any inquiry into a sub-caste nor did it amend the Presidential Order. The Appellant had claimed 'Mochi' caste based on their genealogical caste history, which was validated by the Scrutiny Committee.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court undertook an erroneous exercise of appreciating evidence in exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The High Court swayed itself into a roving inquiry, which was not expected as per settled legal position. The Scrutiny Committee is an expert forum armed with fact-finding authority and should not be interfered with.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals stand allowed, and the impugned judgment passed by the High Court stands set-aside. The validation order dated 03.11.2017 passed by the Scrutiny Committee is restored. There shall be no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the registration of a sale deed. The appellants (plaintiffs) claim that the respondent's (defendants') sale deed is not registered, and they seek to have it decreed. The sale deed in question was presented for registration in 1985.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' arguments include:

* The sale deed does not contain the signatures of all parties, specifically the mother's signature, which is a requirement under Section 32A of the Act, 1908.
* The respondent's (defendants') argument that the sale deed was registered in 1985, before the amendment to Section 32A, and therefore exempt from the new requirements.

The respondents' arguments include:

* Relying on various judgments to argue that the registration of a sale deed is not mandatory, and that the absence of certain signatures or documents does not render it invalid.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:

* The cases relied upon by the respondent do not extend any benefit in this case due to distinguishable facts.
* There was no requirement under law for the vendee to mandatorily sign the document of sale, affix passport size photograph and thumb impression along with proof of identification prior to the insertion of Section 32A in the Act, 1908 in the year 2001.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, setting aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and restoring that of the first Appellate Court. The suit was decreed with exemplary costs, quantified at Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakhs only) to be paid to the appellants within eight weeks from the date of the judgment. The liability to pay costs shall be borne equally by each of the two respondents.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of two police officials, Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (A1) and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel (A2), for custodial torture resulting in the death of a prisoner, Jiva. The incident occurred at Amraiwadi Police Station, and the deceased was later found dead at Sabarmati Central Jail.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's theory is that A1 and A2 assaulted the victim while he was detained at the Amraiwadi Police Station, resulting in fatal injuries. The key prosecution witnesses (PW-1 and PW-2) attributed a motive to the accused police officials, stating that they singled out Jiva for custodial torture due to his prior criminal antecedents.
The defense argued that the victim's death occurred at Sabarmati Central Jail, and there was no evidence of injuries or assault while he was in custody at Amraiwadi Police Station. The defense also pointed out that the prison authorities did not make any notes of injuries during Jiva's admission to the jail premises.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution failed to bring home the guilt of both accused persons, A1 and A2, by leading cogent, convincing, and reliable evidence. The court also noted that there was no investigation from the prison authorities to rule out the possibility of injuries having been caused while Jiva was lodged in the jail.
The court further observed that the theory of motive attributed by the prosecution witnesses (PW-1 and PW-2) to the accused A1 and A2 is not palpable, as merely having prior criminal antecedents does not provide a motive for the accused police officials to have singled out Jiva for custodial torture.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court acquitted both accused persons, Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (A1) and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel (A2), of the charges. The judgment dated 4th March, 1997 passed by the trial Court and the judgment dated 13th February, 2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court were quashed and set aside.
The appeal was allowed in these terms, with both accused persons being acquitted of the charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction and sentencing of three accused-appellants, Allarakha Habib Memon, Amin @ Lalo Aarifbhai Memon, and Mohmedfaruk @ Palak Safibhai Memon. They were arrested and examined for injuries found on their bodies after making disclosure statements leading to recoveries.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's case relied heavily on the disclosure statements made by the accused-appellants, which led to recoveries of incriminating articles. However, the prosecution failed to prove that the recovered articles remained in safe custody from the time of seizure till they reached the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL).
The court observed that the FSL report was not corroborated with link evidence, and the prosecution did not examine any witness who could attest to the safe custody of the mudammal articles.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the prosecution's case suffered from several infirmities, including:
* Failure to prove the disclosure statements made by the accused-appellants as per law
* Lack of link evidence to establish the incriminating nature of the recovered articles
* Inadequate examination of witnesses regarding the safe custody of the mudammal articles
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals and acquitted the accused-appellants, giving them the benefit of doubt. The impugned judgments of the trial Court and the High Court were quashed and set aside. The accused-appellants were released from bail, and their bail bonds were discharged.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a legal dispute related to the execution of an order by a lower court. The appellants had filed a petition, but the executing court did not afford them one opportunity of hearing to place their written objections on record. As a result, they were subjected to severe consequences such as arrest, detention in a civil prison, and attachment of property.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants focused on the fact that the executing court should have been more considerate in declining to take their objections on record and give them an opportunity for hearing. They contended that this oversight was despite the severe consequences imposed upon them, and that the High Court could have remanded the matter to the executing court to provide a hearing.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court highlight that the impugned order passed by the High Court is unsustainable in law. The court also noted that the supervisory jurisdiction vested in the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution should have been exercised to take care of such situations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states that it sets aside the order passed by the High Court and also that of the executing court. The court clarifies that it shall be open for the respondents (decree-holders) to file a fresh application if there is any interference at the instance of the appellants (judgment-debtors) in so far as their possession of the property in question is concerned.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a review petition filed by the petitioner, who was a third-party purchaser of a property. The property in question was previously sold to the defendants 6 and 8, but the sale deed was executed after the institution of a review petition in the registry of this Court. The petitioner claimed that Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act applied, rendering any transfer made during the pendency of the review proceedings subject to the final result of the litigation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that the doctrine of lis pendens does not apply because the petition for review was lying in the registry in a defective state. They contended that Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act would only come into effect once notice is issued by this Court, which had not happened in this case.
On the other hand, the petitioner relied on Section 12 of the Specific Relief Act to claim specific performance, but their application was dismissed due to delay and laches.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court held that it was necessary to exercise discretion under Section 12 to grant relief to the purchaser. However, this Court found that the High Court's decision was not based on sound reasoning, particularly with regards to limitation and specific performance.
It was observed that the petitioner breached an essential condition of the agreements to sell and the suit was filed beyond limitation, disentitling them from claiming specific performance.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This Court allowed the review petitions, setting aside the judgment of the High Court dated 23 April 2021. The High Court's decision was found to be based on errors apparent on the face of the record, specifically with regards to limitation and specific performance.
The judgment of this Court dated 25 August 2022 was recalled, and the original judgment of the High Court was restored.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent, a constable in the State of Rajasthan Police Force, was accused of assaulting his colleague, M. Devnath, during an incident. An inquiry was conducted, and after considering the evidence, including medical reports and statements from witnesses, the charges were found proved.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent's counsel argued that the enquiry officer and disciplinary authority did not meticulously consider the respondent's defense and the weaknesses in the evidence led against him. However, upon reviewing the materials on record, the court found no such perversity in the enquiry report.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the respondent was part of a disciplined force and had been found guilty of assaulting his colleague. The punishment awarded, compulsory retirement, was not shockingly disproportionate to the proven misconduct. A sympathetic view had already been taken in the matter considering the respondent's past service.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned order of the High Court, and dismissed the writ petition filed by the respondent (original petitioner). The punishment of compulsory retirement awarded to the respondent was affirmed. There was no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a complaint filed under Section 498A of the IPC by a woman against her husband and his relatives. The FIR was lodged on April 9, 2021. A criminal complaint was also filed in the court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the defense team may have argued against the application of Section 498A and its Explanation, citing its potential misuse and the need for a more nuanced approach to dealing with dowry harassment cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was no concrete evidence presented in the case to support the allegations made by the woman. The court also noted that the woman's complaint did not specify any specific incidents of harassment or cruelty.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. The proceedings in CHI/1856/2021 arising from FIR No. 95 of 2021, pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Hisar, were quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves seven accused persons (appellants) who were convicted of murder under Section 302 IPC. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence, including the testimonies of eyewitnesses and a post-mortem report indicating unnatural death.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' defense team argued that the prosecution had failed to prove their involvement in the crime beyond reasonable doubt. They pointed out various inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, including doubts about the motive for the alleged crime. The defense also highlighted the lack of direct evidence linking the accused persons to the offense.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution's case was full of glaring doubts regarding the offense of abduction and noted that the offense of murder is entirely dependent on circumstantial evidence. The court further observed that there was no direct evidence on record to prove the commission of murder by the accused persons.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concluded that the prosecution had failed to discharge its burden to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the findings of conviction arrived at by the Trial Court and the High Court were not sustainable. The High Court erred in reversing the acquittal of A-6 and A-7. Accordingly, the impugned judgment as well as the judgment rendered by the Trial Court (to the extent of conviction of A-1 to A-5) were set aside, and all seven accused persons (appellants) were hereby acquitted of all the charges levelled upon them.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute related to scheduled properties under item No.2.
The parties involved are multiple, with the Trial Court and High Court having passed preliminary decrees in favor of one party.
The question of law at issue is whether the majority or minority view in Mary Cheriyan (supra) should be followed.
The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The focus is on analyzing and applying existing legal principles rather than presenting new arguments.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Concurrent findings of fact are generally not interfered with by the Supreme Court, but there are specific scenarios where interference may be warranted (Para 50).
The burden of proof lies on the appellant to show that concurrent findings are unjust and warranting interference (Para 56.2).
The pronouncement of law in this judgment will apply prospectively (Para 58).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal, affirming the preliminary decree passed by the Trial Court and upheld by the High Court.
The Trial Court is directed to proceed further as per law.
The pronouncement of law in this judgment will apply prospectively, and any transaction concluded or ongoing prior to this judgment will not be disturbed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a brutal murder, and the appellants were convicted by the Sessions Judge, Ambala. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh upheld the convictions in its judgments dated 14th February 2017 and 17th February 2017, respectively.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' counsel argued that the confessional statements made by the accused to the police officer while in custody were inadmissible as evidence under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The counsel contended that these statements were made without proper caution and recording.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was no legal evidence to prove the involvement of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence, which did not satisfy the required standard of proof. The court also cautioned against convicting an accused based solely on strong suspicions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the judgments dated 14th February 2017 and 17th February 2017 passed by the Sessions Judge, Ambala, as well as the impugned judgment dated 10th February 2020 passed in Criminal Appeal Nos.D-335-DB and D-398-DB of 2017 (O&M) by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. The court acquitted the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the ownership and classification of land. The petitioner got possession of the subject land based on a lease from the respondent Panchayat. The petitioner claimed that they were in self-cultivating possession of the land for 12 years preceding the commencement of the 1961 Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioner included their claim of self-cultivating possession of the land, which would render them eligible for certain benefits under the relevant laws. The petitioner also argued that they had been in continuous possession of the land for over a decade, entitling them to protection under the law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court considered various aspects of the case, including the nature of the land, the duration of the petitioner's possession, and the relevant provisions of the applicable laws. The court observed that the petitioner's claim of self-cultivating possession was negated by the entries in the Jamabandi for the year 1950-51, which showed the land as "banjar qadim" or old fallow.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concluded that taking note of the nature of the land and the duration of the petitioner's possession, their claim for cultivation over the land could not be presumed for a period of 12 years immediately preceding the commencement of the 1961 Act. The court also noted that the petitioner who got in possession of the subject land based on a lease cannot be heard to contend that they cease to be a lessee.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a civil appeal involving the appointment of the respondent to a certain position. The respondent had applied for the position, but their application was rejected by the appellant. The respondent then filed a writ petition in the High Court, which was allowed, and they were appointed to the position.
However, the appellant appealed against this decision to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are as follows:

* The appellant argued that the respondent did not meet the criteria for suitability for the position, as per the guidelines laid down by the government. They contended that despite being selected by the High Court, the respondent was not suitable for the position.
* The respondent argued that they had been unfairly rejected by the appellant and that their appointment by the High Court was justified. They claimed that they possessed all the necessary qualifications and skills required for the position.
* The Supreme Court also considered a coordinate bench's decision in Canara Bank vs. A.N. Rai, which held that an appointing authority has to consider not only suitability but also seniority while making appointments.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The court observed that it had previously disagreed with a coordinate bench's decision in Canara Bank vs. A.N. Rai, which held that an appointing authority has to consider not only suitability but also seniority while making appointments.
* The court noted that the respondent had been granted time to obtain instructions regarding whether they were covered under the scheme of 2005 for lumpsum ex-gratia payment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Supreme Court is as follows:

* The court set aside the impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench as well as that of the Single Bench.
* The civil appeal was allowed on the terms that the appellant would make a lumpsum payment of Rs. 2.5 lakh to the respondent within a period of 2 months from the date of the order, in addition to the Rs. 50,000/- already paid to the respondent.

Note: The court invoked its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and directed the appellant to make the lumpsum payment to the respondent.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The first respondent, a consumer of electricity, challenged the demand for minimum guarantee charges made by the appellants, a power distribution company. The issue arose due to the first respondent's failure to consume the monthly minimum units as per their contract.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The key arguments presented in this case are:

*   The first respondent argued that they were not liable to pay the minimum guarantee charges since they had not consumed the required amount of electricity.
*   The appellants, on the other hand, contended that the decision made by the court on 4th May, 2000 and reiterated by another judge on 14th February, 2001, was final and binding on the first respondent.
*   The appellants also pointed out that the second writ petition filed by the first respondent was not maintainable as it re-agitated an issue that had already been decided against them.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case are:

*   The court noted that a point, even if wrongly decided, binds the party against whom it is decided and cannot be urged in a subsequent suit or proceeding at the same level.
*   It was observed that the first respondent had re-agitated an issue that had already been decided against them, making their second writ petition not maintainable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately held that:

*   The orders dated 4th May, 2000 and 14th February, 2001, had judicially crystallised the liability of the first respondent to pay the minimum guarantee charges.
*   Since these orders had attained finality, they bound the first respondent, making it impossible for them to re-agitate the same issue in a subsequent suit or proceeding.

The court's judgment effectively validated the appellants' claims and dismissed the second writ petition filed by the first respondent.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the Indore Development Authority (IDA) and respondent No. 1 regarding the cancellation of an auction for a plot of land. The IDA had issued a Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) with a minimum rate of Rs. 15,000/- per square meter. However, after the tender process was completed, it was found that the minimum rate specified in the NIT was erroneous and needed to be revised.
The IDA decided to cancel the auction and issue a fresh NIT to rectify the situation. Respondent No. 1 had submitted the highest bid of Rs. 26,000/- per square meter but had not participated in the subsequent tender process.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The IDA argued that it had the right to cancel the auction and issue a fresh NIT due to the erroneous minimum rate specified in the original NIT. The IDA also contended that respondent No. 1 did not have any right to insist on further negotiation or participation in the subsequent tender process.
Respondent No. 1 argued that the cancellation of the auction was arbitrary and that the IDA had no grounds for cancelling the tender process. Respondent No. 1 relied heavily on the case of Eva Agro (supra) which held that an auctioning authority cannot cancel an auction without providing valid reasons.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the facts of the present case were distinguishable from those in Eva Agro (supra). The IDA had provided valid reasons for cancelling the auction and issuing a fresh NIT to rectify the error in the minimum rate specified in the original NIT.
The court also noted that respondent No. 1 did not participate in the subsequent tender process despite being given the opportunity to do so.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the IDA had acted within its powers in cancelling the auction and issuing a fresh NIT. The court set aside the order of the Division Bench of the High Court at Indore Bench which had interfered with the decision of the Tender Evaluation Committee to generate more revenues.
The court directed the IDA to issue a fresh NIT for disposing of the land in question enabling it to generate more revenues. The IDA was also directed not to dispose of the land except by way of public auction or issuing an NIT in future.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was accused of committing a gruesome crime and was awarded the death penalty by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
The appellant hails from a poor nomadic community in Maharashtra and had an alcoholic father, suffering parental neglect and poverty.
He dropped out of school when he was 10 years old and was forced to start working to support his family, doing odd jobs.
The appellant has no criminal antecedents and there are various other mitigating circumstances existing in his favour as per the reports discussed above.
The medical reports of the appellant disclose that he has speech issues, and he has undergone an angioplasty in 2014, apart from suffering other serious ailments.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued for the death penalty, citing the grave nature of the crime committed by the appellant.
The defence, on the other hand, argued that the appellant was not a hardened criminal and could be reformed.
The defence also pointed out various mitigating circumstances, including the appellant's poor background, lack of education, and serious health issues.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that while the crime committed by the appellant is unquestionably grave and unpardonable, it is not appropriate to affirm the death sentence awarded to him.
The court observed that the doctrine of "rarest of rare" requires that death sentence should not be imposed only by taking into consideration the grave nature of crime but only if there is no possibility of reformation by a criminal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was partly allowed, and the order of conviction as recorded by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay was affirmed.
The sentence of death penalty imposed by the courts below under Section 302 was converted to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment without remission.
It was made clear that the appellant-accused shall not be entitled to make any representation for remission till he completes 20 years of actual rigorous imprisonment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The accused appellant was convicted and sentenced for a crime. The prosecution relied on three links of circumstantial evidence to prove the guilt of the accused: (1) the disclosure made by the accused under Section 27 IEA, (2) the recovery of incriminating articles from the accused's house, and (3) DNA profiling.
The Investigating Officer (PW-22) testified that the accused led him and panch witnesses to recover Rs. 3,50,000/-. However, he did not mention the accused leading them to the crime scene where skeletal remains were found.
Dr. Syed Irshad, Medical Officer (PW-15), and panch witnesses (PW-9 and PW-19) also testified that they had been shown the skeletal remains by police and other persons, but did not make any statement about the accused leading them to the crime scene.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the disclosure made by the accused under Section 27 IEA was proved as per law, and the recovery of incriminating articles from the accused's house was linked to the accused.
However, the defense argued that the prosecution failed to establish the disclosure made by the accused as per law, and the recovery of incriminating articles could not be linked to the accused without proper evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution failed to prove the disclosure made by the accused under Section 27 IEA as per law. 
The court also noted that the Investigating Officer (PW-22) did not mention the accused leading them to the crime scene where skeletal remains were found, but instead only mentioned the accused leading them to recover Rs. 3,50,000/-.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that none of the incriminating circumstances portrayed by the prosecution in its endeavour to bring home the charges against the accused appellant were established by cogent and clinching evidence.
As a consequence of the above discussion, the court quashed and set aside the impugned judgments dated 13th October, 2016, and 20th March, 2019. The accused appellant was acquitted of the charges, and he was released forthwith if not wanted in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the Bank and the accused persons regarding a loan transaction. The accused persons had taken a loan from the Bank, which was later settled through an Out of the System (OTS) scheme. After receiving the OTS amount, the Bank decided to close the loan account. The dispute involved civil overtones.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court refused to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC to quash the proceedings, citing that a serious offense under Section 307 IPC was involved. However, the Supreme Court took into consideration various factors, including the intervention of village elders and the parties' decision to live peacefully in the future, and ultimately quashed and set aside the criminal proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court reiterates that criminal cases having predominantly civil character should be quashed when parties have resolved their disputes among themselves. The Court notes that the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak due to the settlement between the parties, and continuing the criminal proceedings would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allows the appeal, quashing and setting aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. The criminal proceedings against the appellants are also quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between the appellant and respondents regarding the delay in commissioning of a solar power project under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The respondents claimed that they were entitled to an extension of time under Article 2.5 of the PPA due to unforeseen circumstances, specifically delays in land use conversion process.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:

* Respondents' claim that the delay was not attributable to them but rather due to the lengthy and arduous land use conversion process, which was acknowledged by the government.
* Appellant's contention that force majeure clause (Article 8.3) does not apply in this case as the respondents failed to comply with the notice requirement under Article 8.3(b)(i).
* Appellant's further argument that the extension of time under Article 2.5 is not warranted, and consequently, liquidated damages or reduction of tariff under Articles 2.2 and 5.1 of the PPA should be imposed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:

* The government's acknowledgment that the land use conversion process for solar power projects is a long and arduous one, which led to deemed conversion under the present scheme.
* The large number of cases that raised similar grounds and the government's response showed that the delay was not faced by the respondents alone.
* The court's consideration of the letter dated 02.03.2017 from the appellant granting a 6-month extension to the respondents after considering their individual facts and circumstances.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment rendered by the court is as follows:

* The APTEL's findings that the delay was not attributable to the respondents and that the force majeure clause (Article 8.3) applies in this case are upheld.
* The extension of time under Article 2.5 is warranted, and consequently, there is no occasion for the imposition of liquidated damages or reduction of tariff under Articles 2.2 and 5.1 of the PPA.
* The court rejects the appellant's contention that the APTEL's direction to pay late payment surcharge to the respondents is unjustified since it was not pleaded.

The appeals are dismissed, and no order as to costs is made.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellant-MCD had established a WTE project in Delhi, which was on Design, Build, Finance and Operate basis. The ownership of the Project was always to be with the Appellant-MCD, and the operation of the facility is required to be transferred back to the Appellant-MCD after 25 years. The DERC granted its approval to the tariff with certain conditions. However, the APTEL upset this decision on a hyper-technical ground.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant-MCD argued that the APTEL erred in treating them as a total stranger and failed to consider all relevant factors while making their decision. The DERC had taken into consideration the mandate of Rule 15 of the SWM Rules 2016, financial evaluation report, certificate on conformity of bidding process, and the mandate under the NTP to procure entire power generated by the WTE project from Discoms.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The APTEL failed to consider that the WTE project was in the larger public interest and provided for disposal of huge quantity of waste generated in Delhi. The Tribunal also failed to take into consideration that the Appellant-MCD was establishing the said Project to perform its statutory obligations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals of the Appellant-MCD, quashed and set aside the Impugned common final judgment and order of the APTEL, and affirmed the orders of the DERC. The Court observed that the APTEL had grossly erred in treating the present Appellant-MCD as a total stranger.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. filed by the respondent no. 1 in S.C. No. 61/2014 before the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge. The petitioner had earlier filed an application under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. which was rejected, but they rehashed the same grounds in a subsequent application. The State initially opposed all the applications up to the High Court but later turned turtle and supported the respondent no. 1 in the Supreme Court without providing any tenable justification for the earlier investigation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the trial had not concluded even after eleven years of the incident, and speedy justice was necessary. The State's initial opposition to the application and subsequent support were also highlighted as contributing factors to the delay in the proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the parties involved in the case had contributed to the delay, with no valid justification for attempting to delay the proceedings. The administration of justice relies on the faith of citizenry, and any attempt to shake that faith should be nipped in the bud instantly.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 30.04.2021 in Criminal RC (MD) No. 533 of 2020. The court dismissed Cr. M.P. No 40/2020 filed by the respondent no. 1 before the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. Additionally, the additional charge sheet dated 02.12.2021 would not be taken on record. The appeal was allowed, and the trial was directed to be concluded with judgment pronounced within eight weeks from the date of the order.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves A-1, A-2, and A-3 who were found guilty of offences under sections 148, 302, and 307, IPC read with section 34 thereof. The prosecution's case was that the accused persons had committed the crimes at a specific place surrounded by shops and residential houses.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that there is no testimony of any independent witness, despite the place of crime being surrounded by shops and residential houses. They also contended that the oral evidence of P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5 was not trustworthy and reliable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that examination of independent witnesses is not an indispensable requirement, and non-examination of any independent witness by the prosecution will not go to the root of the matter affecting the decision of the court. The court also noted that the testimonies of P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5 were deemed trustworthy and reliable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's decision finding A-1, A-2, and A-3 guilty of offences under sections 148, 302, and 307, IPC read with section 34 thereof was affirmed as correct and upheld. The appeal was dismissed as it was bereft of any merit.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute related to the ownership of property. The original defendants/appellants claimed that Sultan Saheb made a gift of his property to his sons through an oral declaration and subsequently executed a mutation entry in their favor.
The mutation entry was allegedly created with the intention of making a gift, but there is no clear and unequivocal declaration of intent mentioned in it.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The original defendants/appellants relied on the testimonies of two witnesses (DW2 Rasoolsab and DW3 Gulabsingh) examined by them to prove that Sultan Saheb possessed the requisite intent and made a declaration in favor of his sons.
However, the court did not find their testimonies to be relevant or credible, stating that they were vague and seemed to be grasping at fading memory.
The original defendants/appellants also claimed that the mutation entry was created with the intention of making a gift, but the court disagreed, stating that neither the words of the mutation entry nor the entry itself supported this claim.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There is no clear and unequivocal declaration of intent mentioned in the mutation entry.
The testimonies of the two witnesses (DW2 Rasoolsab and DW3 Gulabsingh) examined by the original defendants/appellants were not found to be relevant or credible by the court.
The concept of partition is foreign to this branch of personal law, and therefore, registration is not applicable in this case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately ruled in favor of the respondents, holding that the oral gift made by Sultan Saheb in favor of his sons was not valid due to the lack of a clear and unequivocal declaration of intent.
The court also confirmed the order passed by the Trial Court in O.S. No.140/88 and ascertained by the High Court in RFA No.469 of 1998, which was clubbed with RFA No.493 of 1998.
Both the appeals stand dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the Appellant, who has been serving a sentence for over 25 years. The Appellant raised a plea of juvenility and filed a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, seeking enforcement of a right conferred under a social welfare legislation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant's counsel argued that the Court should have dealt with the plea of juvenility under the existing laws at the relevant point in time. It was also submitted that the Executive cannot be construed to have undertaken an adjudication on the determination of the age of the accused, and therefore, the High Court's reasoning was incorrect.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Appellant has undergone imprisonment for almost 25 years, during which time society has undergone significant transformation. The Appellant might be unaware of and find difficult to adjust with this change upon release.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed in excess of the upper limit prescribed under the relevant Act. While maintaining the conviction, the Appellant was released forthwith if not required in any other case. The Uttarakhand State Legal Services Authority was directed to assist the Appellant's rehabilitation and reintegration into society by facilitating his access to welfare schemes for livelihood, shelter, and sustenance.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between parties regarding the ownership and division of land. The lease deed dated 07.05.1922 is the basis of acquisition of the property, with Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad being the lessees. The revenue records in the basic year show the names of Sami Ullah, Badlu, and Zahoor Ahmad as recorded. However, the dispute arises regarding the extent of their respective shares in the land.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the respondents (petitioners of writ petition No. 6635 of 1974) argued against the consolidation authorities' decision to allot a 1/2 share to Zahoor Ahmad on the basis that the property was jointly acquired by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the lease deed in question was not taken as joint family property by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad, as the concept of joint family property is prevalent amongst Hindus but not amongst Muslims. The authorities below misdirected themselves by considering the acquisition of the property by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad as joint acquisition for the family.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court held that the petitioners of writ petition No. 6635 of 1974 have a 1/12 share jointly in the plots comprised in khata Nos. 98 and 99, excluding plot Nos. 35, 37, 111, and 112 which exclusively belong to Sami Ullah and his brother Badlu.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The complainant wife lodged a complaint under Section 498A of the IPC against her husband and his family members. The FIR was registered, and an investigation was conducted. The High Court allowed the criminal application filed by the accused-husband's petition for quashing the criminal proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the continuation of the criminal proceedings would result in an abuse of process of law. They also contended that the allegations made by the complainant cannot be presumed to be false and should be examined by the Trial Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there has been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife. The court also noted that making vague and generalized allegations during matrimonial conflicts can lead to the misuse of legal processes.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the continuance of the criminal proceedings against the appellants would result in an abuse of process of law. The court allowed the appeal, quashed the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, and set aside the criminal proceedings against the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
Mathew was carrying on a business of procurement and supply of railway tickets without the authorization of the railways. 
Ramesh was an authorized agent of the railways carrying on the same business. 
The case involved Section 143 of the Act, which deals with unauthorized persons carrying out such businesses.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
It was argued that Mathew committed an offense under Section 143 of the Act by carrying out the business without authorization. 
However, Ramesh's actions were not punishable under this section as he was an authorized agent. 
The court also considered the principles for quashing criminal proceedings and applied them to the facts of the case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the allegations against Mathew fulfilled the elements required under Section 143(1)(a) of the Act, but this was not the case with Ramesh. 
The nature of allegations against Ramesh did not attract Section 143, as he was an authorized agent. 
Section 143 does not criminalize creating multiple user IDs and only penalizes unauthorized agents.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the lead appeal and ordered that the criminal proceedings against Mathew be restored to their logical conclusion. 
It also quashed the criminal proceedings against Ramesh, as he was an authorized agent under Section 143 of the Act.
The observations made by the court were not intended to express an opinion on the merits of the prosecution's case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the classification of pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as "edible oil". The respondents, who are manufacturers and sellers of coconut oil, claim that their product falls under Heading 1513 (Section III-Chapter 15) of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, which pertains to edible oils. On the other hand, the Revenue argues that the same product can also be used as a hair oil, thereby making it eligible for classification under Heading 3305 (Section VI-Chapter 33) of the First Schedule.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of the respondents:
* The respondents' product has a reasonable claim to be classified under Heading 1513, which would deny it the residuary clause.
* The revenue should not put people in doubt about their liability to pay duty.

Arguments against the respondents:
* The expression "for use" can only mean "intended for use", not "actual use".
* The burden of proof lies with the Revenue if they intend to classify goods under a particular heading or sub-heading.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court:
* It is good fiscal policy to not put people in doubt and quandary about their liability to pay duty.
* When an article has, by all standards, a reasonable claim to be classified under an enumerated item in the Tariff Schedule, it would be against the principle of classification to deny it that parentage and consign it to an orphanage of the residuary clause.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as "edible oil" would be classifiable under Heading 1513 in Section III-Chapter 15 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The judgment stated that this classification would apply unless the packaging satisfies all the requirements set out in Chapter Note 3 in Section VI-Chapter 33 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, read with the General/Explanatory Notes under the corresponding Chapter Note 3 in Chapter 33 of the Harmonized System of Nomenclature.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was convicted under Section 302 r/w 34 IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life. The conviction was based on the shooting of a deceased due to sudden provocation. The appellant was also acquitted of charges under Section 25/27 of the Arms Act. The certificate from the Jailor, District Jail, Haridwar revealed that the appellant had undergone a sentence for over 14 years without remission and had good conduct during this period.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are not explicitly stated. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the defense team argued that the appellant was provoked into committing the crime, which would mitigate his sentence. The prosecution likely argued for a harsher sentence given the severity of the crime.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the object of punishment is not only to deter the accused from committing further crimes but also to reform and retribute. The extent of reformation can be derived only by the conduct of the accused exhibited during his days of retribution. The court noted that the appellant had good conduct during his period of incarceration, which suggested a possibility of reformation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the appellant is modified to the period already undergone by him. The court clarified that the appellant shall pay the fine amount imposed by the Sessions Court if not paid already. He shall be set at liberty if not required in any other case. The bail bond executed by the appellant stands discharged.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves four accused-appellants who were convicted under Sections 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for the murder of a person. The prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence, including the fact that the victim was last seen with the accused-appellants, recovery of a meat bag from near the spot, the accused-appellants walking on a pathway near Mohan Singh's shop in the night, and their inquiry about the deceased in the evening of 2.2.1997.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The trial court and the High Court failed to test the evidence on record to find out whether the incriminating circumstances were proved beyond reasonable doubt and whether they were of definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused-appellants.

The prosecution's case was not based on direct evidence but on circumstantial evidence, which needed to be closely scrutinized. However, the courts below failed to do so and relied heavily on the disclosure statement/discovery/recovery without carefully weighing the evidence on record.

The circumstance of last seen, recovery of a meat bag, accused-appellants walking near Mohan Singh's shop in the night, and inquiry about the deceased were not of definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused-appellants. Circumstance (iii) was not even proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The disclosure statement was not admissible as it did not lead to discovery. The stone, etc., were allegedly recovered even before the disclosure statement was recorded. Neither Doctor's (PW-1's) statement nor forensic report could connect them with the crime.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There are several observations made in the case:

The High Court erred in converting the conviction from one punishable under Section 302 to Section 304 Part I of IPC only because, according to it, the fatal injury could be a result of a solitary blow.

Multiple injuries were found on the body of the deceased apart from two incised wounds on the head with underlying fracture of occipital bone of the skull. In such a scenario, whoever committed the crime had clear intention to kill the deceased.

The accused-appellants are entitled to be acquitted of the charges for which they have been tried and convicted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed. The impugned order is set aside. The appellants are acquitted of the charges for which they have been tried and convicted. They are on bail, and their bail bonds stand discharged.

The judgment is based on the fact that the prosecution had failed to establish the chain of incriminating circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the ownership and possession of a suit land. The first respondent (plaintiff) claims to be the rightful owner of the property, while the appellants (defendants) have created third-party rights in the property.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the first respondent's claim for recovery of possession was contested by the appellants, who claimed to have valid third-party rights in the property.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had previously passed a judgment and decree in favor of the first respondent, declaring their entitlement to recover possession of the suit land. The appellate court dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants, upholding the decision of the High Court.
The Supreme Court observed that the reckoning of the period of limitation from the date of commencement of the right of ownership of the plaintiff over the suit land was correctly interfered with by the High Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants, upholding the decision of the High Court. The court also ordered that the contempt petition be closed as there is no further need to proceed with it, given that the judgment and decree in favor of the first respondent has become final.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The original plaintiff (appellant) sought specific performance of a contract for the sale of property from the original defendants (respondents). The respondents were Prabha Ranjan Das's wife and son, who were attempting to take over the suit property after Prabha Ranjan Das passed away. The appellant claimed that he was always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in this case revolve around the issue of hardship under Section 20(2)(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The respondents argued that they faced financial difficulties due to Prabha Ranjan Das's passing away and that the sale of the property would cause them significant hardship. They also claimed that the suit property was their only shelter.
However, the appellant presented evidence showing that the respondents were not in dire need of the property as they had been residing separately from Prabha Ranjan Das before his death. The appellant also argued that he was always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the respondents failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate their inability to pay for alternative accommodations or to prove that the sale of the property would cause them significant hardship. The court also noted that the respondents' attempt to take over the suit property after Prabha Ranjan Das's passing away was a tactical move rather than a genuine need.
Furthermore, the court pointed out that the Trial Court had already found in favor of the appellant on the issue of readiness and willingness, which was not disturbed by the High Court. 
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, setting aside the impugned order passed by the High Court. The original decree passed by the Trial Court was modified to increase the amount paid towards the balance consideration from Rs. 13,50,000/- to Rs. 20,00,000/-.

The High Court's impugned judgment and order dated 7th November 2017 is quashed and set aside. The appeal stands allowed, and the Insurance Company (Respondent No. 2) is directed to disburse the compensation awarded to the appellant as above. An amount of Rs.10,00,000/- should be disbursed to the father of the appellant as her guardian. The rest of the amount be invested in one or more Fixed Deposits Receipts so as to attract the maximum rate of interest.

The case revolves around a dispute regarding the Mega Power Status granted to a project under the Mega Power Policy by the Ministry of Power on 30.07.2010. The respondent had applied for the status on 11.05.2010, and it became eligible on 16.04.2010.
A press release was issued on 01.10.2009 announcing the decision to grant the Mega Power Status, but the notifications were issued by the concerned ministries of the Government of India on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009.
The appellant claimed that the benefits under the Mega Power Policy should be applicable from a prior date, while the respondent argued that the benefits would only apply from 30.07.2010, the date when the status was granted.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:
- The appellant argued that the press release of 01.10.2009 was a change in law event and that the benefits under the Mega Power Policy should be applicable from that date.
- The respondent argued that the decision to grant the Mega Power Status was taken on 11.05.2010, and the status became effective on 30.07.2010, making it the relevant date for claiming benefits.
- Various judgments were cited by both parties, including Bachhittar Singh vs. The State of Punjab, [1962] Supp. 3 SCR 713, to contend that the press release was not an "order" and did not constitute a change in law event.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The court noted that the Mega Power Status was granted to the project under the Mega Power Policy on 30.07.2010, based on the application filed by the respondent on 11.05.2010.
- The court observed that the press release of 01.10.2009 announcing the decision to grant the status did not constitute a change in law event and could not be considered as the relevant date for claiming benefits.
- The court relied on various judgments, including Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited vs. Adani Power Maharashtra Limited and Others, (2023) 7 SCC 401, to support its conclusion that the press release of 01.10.2009 was not a change in law event.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states:
- The court dismissed the Civil Appeal filed by the appellant and upheld the concurrent judgments of the courts below.
- The court held that the benefits under the Mega Power Policy would only apply from 30.07.2010, the date when the status was granted to the project.
- No order as to costs was passed in the judgment.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal related to the admission of a candidate with benchmark disability in an educational institution. The appellant was denied admission due to quantified disability, but the Disability Assessment Board (DAB) opined that the candidate could pursue the course despite their disability. The NMC regulations were challenged for being discriminatory towards individuals with benchmark disabilities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant and their representatives argued against the denial of admission based on the DAB's opinion. The respondents likely argued in favor of the NMC regulations and the decision to deny admission.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that quantified disability per se does not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission to educational institutions. The Disability Assessment Board should positively record whether the disability will or will not hinder the candidate's pursuit of the course, and state reasons if they conclude that the candidate is not eligible.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission to educational institutions. The Disability Assessment Board should opine on whether the candidate can pursue the course despite their disability, and the NMC regulations should be read in light of this judgment.

Directions were issued:

(i) Quantified disability will not disentitle candidates with benchmark disabilities.
(ii) The Disability Assessment Boards must positively record their opinion on the candidate's ability to pursue the course.
(iii) The Disability Assessment Boards must state reasons for denying admission.
(iv) Decisions of the Disability Assessment Boards that give a negative opinion can be challenged in judicial review proceedings.

The appeal was allowed, and the impugned order was set aside. Writ Petition (Stamp) No. 24821 of 2024 pending in the High Court of judicature at Bombay will stand disposed of in terms of the holding in the present judgment.

The case involves a dispute over property ownership, specifically the 2/3rd share of a property held by Govindammal (now her heirs). The facts surrounding the property's original division and the subsequent disputes are not explicitly stated.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's decision to overturn the concurrent findings of the lower courts was incorrect, as it did not meet the requirements for a second appeal under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appellants pointed out that there were no substantial questions of law involved in the case and that the High Court had overstepped its jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the principles regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure have been well-established, dating back to a decision by the Privy Council in 1890 (Mussummai Durga Choudhrain v. Jawahir Singh Choudhri). The court noted that an erroneous finding of fact is not grounds for a second appeal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, restoring the findings of the lower courts. The court held that Govindammal (now her heirs) are entitled to 2/3rd share in the property.

The case involves the conviction of two appellants for a crime. The evidence presented includes testimony from witnesses, including PW-2 and PW-7, as well as physical evidence. The appellants were accused of committing a tragic death.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's argument focuses on the cumulative effect of circumstantial evidence, which overwhelmingly points to the guilt of the appellants. The courts below correctly appreciated the evidence, and no alternate possibility is in sight. The testimony of PW-7 is also crucial, as it states that 100% burns are not possible in cases of suicide or self-immolation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The delay in registration of FIR was examined, but found to be reasonable. The courts below correctly analyzed the evidence collectively and comprehensively. The appeals were dismissed due to the lack of any infirmity in the findings of the courts below.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court and Trial Court findings are upheld, and the appeal is dismissed. The appellants must surrender before the concerned Jail Superintendent within two weeks from the date of the judgment for serving their sentence. The registry will communicate the order forthwith. The present appeal stands disposed of in terms of this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction and sentence of a person in Sessions Case No. 64 of 2013. The appellant had been accused of various crimes, including murder.
The prosecution presented several circumstances to prove the guilt of the appellant, including:
* The recovery of incriminating articles from the appellant's possession
* The presence of blood-stains on the appellant's clothes
* The recovery of jewellery (mangalsutra) which was not identified as belonging to the deceased
* A motive for the crime was also presented by the prosecution
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the prosecution included:
* The recovery of incriminating articles from the appellant's possession, including a knife and clothes with blood-stains
* The presence of two panch witnesses who had searched the area where the incriminating articles were recovered
* The motive for the crime was also presented by the prosecution, which included a dispute over property
The arguments presented by the defense included:
* The recovery of incriminating articles was not proved beyond reasonable doubt
* The presence of blood-stains on the appellant's clothes could be explained as natural given the circumstances of the crime
* The identity of the recovered jewellery (mangalsutra) was not established
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the incriminating articles were in the possession of the appellant
* The presence of blood-stains on the appellant's clothes could be explained as natural given the circumstances of the crime
* The identity of the recovered jewellery (mangalsutra) was not established
The court also observed that solely relying on the circumstance of motive was not sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The appeal against the conviction and sentence is allowed
* The judgment and order of the High Court dated 23rd July 2019 in Confirmation Case No. 2 of 2016 and the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 26th August 2016 and 31st August 2016 passed by the trial court in Sessions Case No.64 of 2013 are quashed and set aside
* The appellant is directed to be set at liberty if not required in any other case
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant joined the post of Ophthalmic Assistant on 06.03.1985 upon production of satisfactory report of medical examination and police verification roll. However, the police verification report was filed only in the year 2010, i.e., after 25 years of service and just two months prior to the date of his retirement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's termination order was set aside by the Tribunal on the ground that it was passed without following the principles of natural justice and without affording any opportunity to explain his case before the authority. However, the High Court allowed the writ petition filed by the State and set aside the order of the Tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The authorities' callous and lackadaisical attitude in submitting the verification report after 25 years is not acceptable. The order of termination passed against the appellant was arbitrary, illegal, and in violation of the principles of natural justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal is allowed, and the order of the High Court is set aside. The service benefits which remain unpaid as on date be paid to the appellant within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. There is no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The deceased, a 25-year-old woman, was found dead. An Accidental Death Report was lodged by the deceased's brother on the day of the incident. However, there is no mention about any involvement of the appellants in the suicidal death of the deceased. The FIR was lodged five days after the incident.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the allegations in the FIR could not be overlooked and that the Accidental Death Report and the statements made in the Accidental Death enquiry would be a matter of trial.

However, the appellants argued that there is no sufficient material to show that they had intended by their words to push the deceased into such a position that she was left with no other option but to commit suicide. They also argued that the close proximity between the positive act of instigation and the commission of suicide by the victim is not established.

The High Court observed that there is no allegation about any harassment or cruelty meted out by the appellants to the deceased in the Accidental Death Report, however, held that the allegations in the FIR could not be overlooked.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's reasoning for refusing to discharge the appellants was considered perfunctory. The prosecution failed to prima facie establish that the appellants had any intention to instigate or aid or abet the deceased to commit suicide.

A gap of over a month between the incident at the mahalokadalat and the commission of suicide would be sufficient time for the deceased to think over and reflect on the matter, thereby dissolving the nexus or proximate link between the two acts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and quashed and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court and the order of the Assistant Sessions Judge. The appellants were discharged from Sessions Case No. 75 of 2015.

The court observed that the continuation of criminal proceedings against the appellants would result in an abuse of process of law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The couple had been separated for an extended period, and the husband filed a petition for divorce. The wife had spent substantial time during the pendency of the litigation without the emotional or financial support of the respondent.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are based on the following points:

*   The court recognized that the couple's marriage had broken down irretrievably and granted a decree of divorce.
*   In determining the amount of permanent alimony to be awarded, the court considered factors such as the duration of the marriage, the earning capacities of the parties, their age and health, their standard of living, and their financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage.
*   The court also took into account that the wife had spent substantial time during the pendency of the litigation without the emotional or financial support of the respondent.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations can be made from this case:

*   The court emphasized the importance of considering the long-term effects of a divorce on both parties, particularly in regards to their financial and emotional well-being.
*   The court recognized that the breakdown of a marriage can have significant consequences for children involved and prioritized their welfare by awarding financial support.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in this case includes:

*   A decree of divorce was granted to the respondent husband due to the couple's marriage having broken down irretrievably.
*   The court awarded a lump sum permanent alimony of Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) to the wife to secure her financial independence and ensure she can lead her life with dignity.
*   An additional amount of Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) was awarded to their daughter for her education and future expenses, such as marriage.
*   The payments were directed to be made within four months from the date of this judgment by the respondent husband to the wife and their daughter.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal appeal arising out of the conviction and sentence of an accused under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The accused was convicted for offenses including murder, kidnapping, and sexual assault on a minor. The trial court had sentenced the accused to death for the offense under Section 302 IPC and other sentences for various sections.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the defense argued against the conviction and sentence of the accused, possibly citing mitigating circumstances or lack of evidence. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued for the conviction and sentence of the accused based on the evidence presented.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include the following:
* The court observed that a sentence of 14 years was grossly disproportionate in certain cases, and a delicate balance needs to be struck between undue leniency and harshness.
* The court noted that a period of imprisonment for 25 years without remission would be a just dessert for the convict.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court is as follows:
* The conviction under Sections 302, 364, 377 of IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the POCSO Act was maintained.
* The sentence of death for the offense under Section 302 was set aside, and substituted with rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 years without remission.
* The sentences imposed for offenses under Section 364 IPC (10 years S.I. and Rs. 10,000/- fine) and Section 6 of the POCSO Act (life imprisonment and Rs.10,000/- fine) were ordered to run concurrently with the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 years without remission.
* The fine amounts imposed were set aside considering the socio-economic condition of the accused.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case is related to a Criminal Appeal No. 5387/2024, where the petitioners are seeking special leave to appeal against the final judgment and order dated 28-11-2023 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna. The appeal is filed on behalf of Athar Parwez.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are related to the bail application of the petitioner, who has been accused under certain sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The petitioners have argued that the petitioner was not involved in any serious offense and has been falsely implicated. They have also cited various precedents where similar cases have been dismissed due to lack of evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are related to the delay in filing the appeal, which was sought to be condoned by the petitioners. The court observed that there is no sufficient reason for the delay and that it could not be explained satisfactorily.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the Supreme Court on December 17, 2024, states that the appeal of Athar Parwez is allowed in terms of the signed Reportable Judgment. The operative portion of the judgment reads: "In the light of the above, the impugned judgment is set aside. The Appeal is accordingly allowed with a direction that the Appellant be enlarged on bail on the appropriate terms and conditions to be fixed by the Special Court." The court further directed that the Appellant for this purpose shall be produced before the Special Court within a maximum period of 07 days from today.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and its powers to investigate cases where public servants are involved. The CBI had registered two FIRs against certain individuals, but the High Court quashed these FIRs on the grounds that the CBI did not have the necessary consent from the State Government under Section 6 of the DSPE Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The CBI argued that it had general consent from the State Government to investigate cases where public servants are involved, as per the notification dated 19.02.1996. The High Court rejected this argument and held that specific consent was necessary for the CBI to proceed with the investigation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The DSPE Act gives the Central Government the power to investigate cases where public servants are involved, without requiring specific consent from the State Government.
* The general consent granted by the State Government in 1996 is sufficient for the CBI to investigate such cases.
* The High Court's decision to quash the FIRs was based on a misinterpretation of the DSPE Act and the notification dated 19.02.1996.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by the CBI, set aside the impugned common order passed by the High Court, and restored the FIRs to the trial court for further proceedings.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of provisions in an Act regarding the applicability of precedents. The Supreme Court had previously passed judgments in cases of Silpi Industries (supra) and Mahakali Foods (supra), which were cited as binding precedents by subsequent orders in Vaishno Enterprises (supra) and M/s Nitesh Estates (supra). However, the court was unsure whether these judgments should be considered binding on the issue at hand.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in this case is that the Supreme Court's previous judgments in Silpi Industries (supra) and Mahakali Foods (supra) cannot be considered binding precedents because they were not intended to declare the law under Article 141. The court also noted that even obiter dicta of the Supreme Court are treated as binding precedents for High Courts and subordinate courts, which creates confusion in determining whether a decision is meant to resolve the dispute between parties or declare the law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that it performs twin functions of decision-making and precedent-making. A substantial portion of its jurisdiction under Article 136 reflects regular appellate disposition of decision-making. The court also noted that every judgment or order made by it is not intended to be a binding precedent under Article 141, unless explicitly stated.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court has directed the Registry to place the appeal paperbooks along with its detailed judgment before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench. The court has deemed it necessary to refer this appeal to a three-Judge Bench, taking into account the compelling need to ensure clarity and certainty about applicable precedents on the subject.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves seven accused persons (appellants) who were convicted of various charges, including murder. The prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence related to the offence of abduction and the subsequent unnatural death of the deceased.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's case was full of glaring doubts regarding the offence of abduction. The post-mortem report indicated that the death of the deceased was unnatural, but there was no direct evidence linking the accused persons to the commission of murder. The circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution failed to meet the test of proof and could not be termed as proved in the eyes of law. The chain of evidence was incomplete, and it did not give out an inescapable conclusion of guilt.
The defence argued that the prosecution had failed to discharge its burden to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The presence of motive alone was not sufficient to establish guilt without proof of foundational facts. In this case, the motive could operate both ways, as the accused persons and eyewitnesses belonged to the same family and there was a property-related dispute.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, which is a weaker form of evidence compared to direct evidence. The court observed that in cases based on circumstantial evidence, the chain of evidence must be complete and give out an inescapable conclusion of guilt. In this case, the prosecution failed to meet this standard.
The court also noted that motive alone cannot establish guilt without proof of foundational facts. In a hypothetical sense, both sides could benefit from implicating each other in the alleged crime.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the prosecution had failed to discharge its burden to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The presence of reasonable doubts, which were irreconcilable and struck at the foundation of the prosecution's case, led to the acquittal of all seven accused persons.
The impugned judgment, as well as the judgment rendered by the Trial Court (to the extent of conviction of A-1 to A-5), was set aside. The court directed that all seven accused persons be released forthwith, if lying in custody.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018, where the appellants sought rectification of their shareholding in a company. The petition was initially dismissed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Amaravati Bench, and later upheld by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
The appellants argued that they had paid ₹14,66,39,400/- to respondent No. 2 for share certificates, but those shares were not reflected in the company's records. They relied on Section 46 of the Companies Act, 2013, which states that the signatures of two directors are sufficient to transfer shares.
The respondents claimed that the appellants' petition was an attempt to suppress fraud and misrepresentation, and that they had provided proof of their ownership of the shares.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
* The NCLT and NCLAT failed to examine the evidence properly, leading to a miscarriage of justice.
* The Acting President of the NCLT ignored the interim order passed on 27.06.2019, which indicated the issues for consideration and the inquiry required to determine the same.
* The documents attached to the Company Petition and the appellants' rejoinder were glossed over or ignored by both the NCLT and NCLAT.
* The NCLAT blindly accepted the story put forth by respondent No. 2, without considering the documentary evidence already placed on record.
* The NCLT and NCLAT failed to give due weightage to the specific facts, as found, so as to draw a reasonable conclusion.

The respondents argued that:
* The appellants' petition was an attempt to suppress fraud and misrepresentation.
* They had provided proof of their ownership of the shares, which should have been considered by the NCLT and NCLAT.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made in the judgment include:
* The Acting President of the NCLT failed to discharge his mandate to verify the aspect of fraud.
* The NCLAT did not get the facts right, ignoring key documents and evidence.
* The passage of time since the institution of the petition should be given due consideration by the National Company Law Tribunal, Amaravati Bench.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
* The appeals deserve to be allowed, as there was a miscarriage of justice in the NCLT and NCLAT decisions.
* The judgments in Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018 and the judgment in Company Appeal (AT) (CH) No. 44 of 2021 & I.A. No. 548 of 2021 are set aside.
* Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018 is restored to the file of the National Company Law Tribunal, Amaravati Bench, for consideration afresh on merits and in accordance with law.
* The parties shall bear their own costs.

<FUNCTI0N> EXTRACTING KEY INFORMATION FROM THE GIVEN CASE </ FUNCTI0N>

<FACTS>
The case involves the accused-appellants, Nusrat Parween/appellant No. 1, Ahmad Khan/appellant No. 2, and Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3, who were charged with an unspecified crime related to Hamida Parween's disappearance. The prosecution story alleged that the accused persons had quarreled with Hamida Parween in the morning of the incident and were seen fleeing away together in a tempo. However, the maternal family members of Hamida Parween did not take any measures to break open the lock on her house after being informed about her missing. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to prove the chain of incriminating circumstances against the accused-appellants by convincing evidence and beyond doubt. The trial Court as well as the High Court erred in appreciating the evidence and holding that the prosecution has proved the case against the accused-appellants beyond all manner of doubt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed several inconsistencies in the prosecution's story, including:
- The delay in reporting Hamida Parween's disappearance
- The failure to bring crucial evidence on record, such as the station diary entry
- The lack of immediate action by the maternal family members after being informed about Hamida Parween's missing
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the appeals and acquitted the accused-appellants. The court observed that the prosecution has failed to prove the case against the accused-appellants beyond all manner of doubt, and therefore, they deserve to be acquitted of the charges. The court further noted that Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3 did not file an appeal challenging the judgment of the High Court, but since the case is identical to that of the other accused-appellants, the benefit of this judgment will also extend to him.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an accused who was convicted of committing a forcible and violent sexual assault on a child victim, followed by strangulation and killing. The prosecution presented circumstantial evidence to prove the accused's guilt.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the chain of incriminating circumstances required to bring home the guilt of the accused is complete in all aspects. They claimed that the five golden principles (Panchsheel) laid down by the court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra were fulfilled, establishing the accused's guilt conclusively.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution had successfully constructed an unbroken chain of circumstances that irrefutably establishes the culpability of the accused to the exclusion of any other hypothesis. However, the court also noted that there were deficiencies in the methodology adopted by both the trial and high courts in appraising and analyzing the circumstantial evidence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the conviction and dismissed the appeals due to the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution. The court emphasized the importance of meticulously discussing and analyzing the testimony of each witness, drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence, and examining each link of incriminating circumstantial evidence carefully.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the quashing of criminal proceedings in a NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) case. The accused was acquitted in the original trial, but later an FIR was registered for forgery of evidence. The High Court had quashed the criminal proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's decision to quash the criminal proceedings was unwarranted and that a re-trial was necessary due to alleged forgery of evidence in the original investigation. They relied on Supreme Court judgments (cited as "2024 SCC OnLine SC 984" and another) which emphasized the importance of fair trial, non-compliance with procedural law, and the power of an Appellate Court to direct a re-trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court include:
* A fair trial is essential for criminal jurisprudence.
* Non-compliance with procedural laws can lead to unfair trials and violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
* An Appellate Court has the power to direct a re-trial in exceptional cases, where irregularities are so material that a re-trial is necessary.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal against the High Court's decision, set aside the order quashing the criminal proceedings, and restored the case on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Nedumangad. The Trial Court was directed to conclude the trial within a period of one year from the date of the judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the Civil Supplies Corporation initiating recovery proceedings against the Rice Millers under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. The Rice Millers had entered into an agreement with the State Government for the procurement, milling, and distribution of public grain. However, they failed to fulfill their obligations, leading to a debt of Rs. 1,26,00,000/-. The Civil Supplies Corporation initiated recovery proceedings against them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

*   The Rice Millers argued that the initiation of recovery proceedings was in violation of the principles of natural justice and procedural irregularities.
*   They claimed that the procedure prescribed under the Act for initiating recovery proceedings was not followed, and the certificate officer's jurisdiction to initiate recovery proceedings is not established.
*   The Civil Supplies Corporation, on the other hand, argued that the Rice Millers had failed to fulfill their obligations under the agreement, resulting in a debt of Rs. 1,26,00,000/-.
*   They claimed that the initiation of recovery proceedings was in accordance with the provisions of the Act and that the certificate officer's jurisdiction is established.

The Court has also observed that the Rice Millers had invoked the writ remedy by raising a jurisdictional fact against realising the sums as a public demand under the Act. As a writ court or in an appeal under Article 136, they are not examining the contentions on alleged procedural deviations.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that:

*   The Rice Millers had failed to exhaust statutory remedies at the first instance by invoking writ jurisdiction.
*   The certificate officer's proceedings have been initiated in due compliance with the provisions of the Act and have been concluded by duly considering the objections raised by the Rice Millers.
*   There is no procedural infirmity in the respective certificates issued in favour of the Civil Supplies Corporation.

The Court has left it open to the respective Rice Millers to avail a statutory remedy as may be available under the Act. For availing a statutory remedy, they have granted thirty days from today to the Rice Millers.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Judgment of the Court is as follows:

*   The Court has dismissed the civil appeals and held that the initiation of recovery proceedings by the Civil Supplies Corporation was valid and justified.
*   The certificate officer's jurisdiction to initiate recovery proceedings is established, and the procedure prescribed under the Act for initiating recovery proceedings was followed.
*   The Rice Millers had failed to exhaust statutory remedies at the first instance by invoking writ jurisdiction.

The Court has also observed that in the event of a Rice Miller availing a statutory remedy as permitted by this Judgment, the said authority shall entertain the case without reference to the delay and the period of limitation in availing a remedy before the said authority.

The acquisition proceedings for the subject land commenced vide the notification under Section 4 dated 25.07.2008. The relevant provisions of the 1894 Act, particularly Section 41, pertain to the process required to be followed in cases of acquisition of land for companies. An agreement between the appropriate government and the company is mandated, ensuring that payment towards the cost of acquisition is made by the company to the appropriate government before the land is transferred.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argues that JAL was mandated to make the requisite payment to the State of Himachal Pradesh prior to the subject land being transferred. However, even before the amount of compensation could be determined, the subject land stood transferred to JAL, which is in contravention of Section 38 of the 2013 Act and Section 41 of the 1894 Act respectively.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the acquisition proceedings were not conducted in accordance with the relevant laws. The payment towards the cost of acquisition was not made by JAL to the State, which is a mandatory requirement under Section 41 of the 1894 Act. This has led to a delay in the compensation being paid to the landowners.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeal and sets aside the impugned order dated 12.07.2022 passed by the High Court. The Respondent Nos. 7 and 10 are directed to pay the compensation amount of Rs. 3,05,31,095/- along with 9% interest thereupon from the date of passing of the Supplementary Award i.e., 02.05.2022 till the date of realization within a period of fifteen days from today. The total amount paid by the State shall be recovered from the Respondent No. 11 (JAL).

<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant against two orders of the Division Bench, one dated 01.04.2010 and the other on a later date. The first order was passed after the appellant had moved the Division Bench seeking a fresh hearing of the main appeal. The second order was passed in response to this request. The case revolves around an issue related to interest rates and a loan taken by the respondent from the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented include:

* The court's decision to reduce the rate of interest on the loan from 36% p.a. to 12% p.a. in the interest of justice.
* The condonation of delay in filing the petitions against the two orders, with a payment of costs of Rs.20,000/- by the appellant to the respondent.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* A discussion on the principles guiding the consideration of an application for condonation of delay, citing several Supreme Court and High Court cases.
* A recognition that justice should be preferred over mere technicalities in matters related to delay.
* The court's decision to allow I.A. No.16204/2019 for exemption from filing a certified copy of the Impugned Judgment(s) and I.A. No.180367/2019 for permission to file additional documents.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:

* The appeals are allowed in part, with the rate of interest on the loan reduced to 12% p.a. from 24.06.2000 till the date of realisation.
* I.A. No.16204/2019 is allowed for exemption from filing a certified copy of the Impugned Judgment(s) and I.A. No.180367/2019 is allowed for permission to file additional documents.
* I.A. No.16203/2019 seeking condonation of delay in filing the petitions is allowed subject to payment of costs of Rs.20,000/- by the appellant to the respondent.

The petitioner has invoked arbitration under an arbitration agreement, and the respondents have raised objections against the present petition. The existence of the arbitration agreement is not denied by the respondents.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents' objections do not question or deny the existence of the arbitration agreement. The requirement of prima facie existence of an arbitration agreement under Section 11 of the Act, 1996, is satisfied. It is open for the respondents to raise all available objections in law after the arbitral tribunal is constituted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The complexity involved in determining whether respondent no. 2 is a party to the arbitration agreement makes it appropriate for the arbitral tribunal to take a call on the question after considering the evidence adduced before it and the application of legal doctrine as elaborated in Cox and Kings (supra).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The present petition is allowed. Shri Justice Mohit S. Shah, former Chief Justice of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, is appointed to act as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator, including other modalities, shall be fixed in consultation with the parties. All rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the appeal of a convict who had taken an undertaking to behave decently. The convict submitted surety bonds and was granted remission under certain conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case revolve around the validity of the conditions imposed on the convict for granting remission. The court analyzed whether the conditions were reasonable, whether they violated Article 14 (arbitrariness) or Article 21 (right to life and liberty), and whether the principles of natural justice were followed in canceling the order of remission.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The first part of condition no.1 regarding behaving decently is manifestly arbitrary, thus it is struck down.
* Condition no.2 stands clarified to mean that registration of a cognizable offense against the convict per se is not a ground for canceling the remission order.
* Action to revoke the remission order must be taken after compliance with the principles of natural justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed in this case includes:
* The appeal is partly allowed on certain terms, specifically regarding the cancellation of the undertaking and surety bonds submitted by the convict.
* The order of remission shall not be revoked without following the principles of natural justice, as stated earlier.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and its applicability to criminal proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The appellants/petitioners sought to stay the prosecution under Section 138, relying on the interim moratorium under Section 96 IBC. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the decisions relied upon by the High Court dealt with proceedings under Section 14 of the IBC and not Section 96. They also claimed that the decision in Dilip B. Jiwrajka (supra) was not relevant to the facts of the present case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the object of moratorium or for that purpose, the provision enabling the debtor to approach the Tribunal under Section 94 is not to stall the criminal prosecution, but to only postpone any civil actions to recover any debt. The deterrent effect of Section 138 is critical to maintain the trust in the use of negotiable instruments like cheques in business dealings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that allowing the respective appellants/petitioners to evade prosecution under Section 138 by invoking the moratorium would undermine the very purpose of the N.I. Act, 1881, which is to preserve the integrity and credibility of commercial transactions. Therefore, the prayer of the appellants / petitioners to stay the prosecution under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881, relying on the interim moratorium under Section 96 IBC, cannot be entertained.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquisition of land by the government for the development of a residential area. The land-owners challenged the compensation amount granted by the Land Acquisition Collector (LAC) and later confirmed by the Reference Court. The High Court reduced the valuation of the land and affirmed the figures granted by the LAC.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are based on the evaluation of the sale deeds and potentiality of the acquired land. The court considered various sale exemplars, including Ex. P/5, which was deemed to be a fair and reasonable basis for compensation. The court also discussed the principles of averaging and the range of deductions applicable towards developmental charges.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the evaluation conducted by the Reference Court was nearly accurate and aligned with the evidence of the sale deeds and potentiality, despite relying on an ideal sale exemplar. The court also noted that the subject land has not been acquired for profiteering or commercial purposes but primarily for residential development.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned leading judgment of the High Court, and restored the compensation amount granted by the Reference Court. The court directed that the compensation amount, if already not paid, shall be paid to the land-owners along with all statutory benefits, including interest, within eight weeks.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around Pranav, a foreign national who had lost his Indian citizenship and was seeking to regain it. He had previously been granted Indian citizenship under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act, but later lost it due to certain reasons not specified in the text.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had held that Pranav had resumed his Indian citizenship under sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the 1955 Act. However, this decision was challenged by the Central Government and other parties, leading to a review of the case.
The Central Government argued that Pranav's loss of citizenship was final and that he could not be granted citizenship again without following the proper procedure.
Pranav's counsel argued that the High Court's decision was correct and that Pranav had indeed resumed his Indian citizenship under Section 8(2) of the 1955 Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The language used in the provisions of the 1955 Act is plain and simple, and should be given ordinary and natural meaning. The legislature's intention should be interpreted according to the rules of grammar, without resorting to equitable considerations.
Citizenship of India cannot be conferred on foreign citizens by doing violence to the plain language of the 1955 Act.
The Central Government has the power to relax the period of twelve months required for Pranav to apply for Indian citizenship under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act, if special circumstances exist.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the impugned orders and allowed the appeal. The Court held that Pranav had not resumed his Indian citizenship under Section 8(2) of the 1955 Act, as claimed by the High Court.
The Court also noted that there was no scope for liberal interpretation of the provisions of the 1955 Act, and that the language used in the statute should be given its ordinary meaning.
Pranav is free to apply for Indian citizenship again under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the 1955 Act, or seek relaxation of the period of twelve months required for application.
</JUDGMENT>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against conviction and a request for reduction in sentence for the crime of murder. The appellant was convicted under Section 302 of IPC (Indian Penal Code) and sentenced to life imprisonment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the Appellant:
* Plea for leniency on account of old age
* Medical condition as a mitigating factor
* Request for reduction in sentence based on parity with other cases

Arguments considered by the Court:
* The severity and deliberate nature of the crime
* The need to uphold the sanctity of life and ensure accountability for violent acts
* The importance of deterring recurrence of such crimes and maintaining public confidence in the rule of law
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court:
* The appellant actively participated in the attack that led to the victim's death
* The crime was committed with intent to target vital organs, making it a heinous act
* The medical condition and old age of the appellant do not outweigh the need for justice and upholding the rule of law

Observations regarding the context:
* The offense occurred in a context of political rivalry, which exacerbates its gravity
* Crimes rooted in such motives can have far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate loss of life, contributing to social unrest and weakening public confidence in the rule of law
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Court:
* The appeal against conviction is dismissed, as the findings of both the Trial Court and the High Court are well-founded and supported by compelling evidence.
* The request for reduction in sentence is also dismissed, as the minimum sentence under Section 302 of IPC is life imprisonment.
* The conviction and sentence are upheld, reflecting the seriousness of the crime and the need to uphold the sanctity of life and ensure accountability for violent acts.

<FACTS>
The case involves the heirs of Sh. S.K. Mitra, who inherited a tenancy from their father in 1970. The appellants claimed that their tenancy did not expire in 2006 due to the introduction of the 1997 Act. However, the Calcutta High Court ruled against them, and they appealed to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellants are:
- The 1997 Act does not have a clear and unequivocal intention to operate retrospectively.
- The provision in the 1997 Act that restricts heritability was added later, and its retrospective application would take away the heritable rights of the tenants.
- The legislature can restrict heritability by amending or repealing the law, but it must be done clearly and unambiguously.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court include:
- Statutory laws operate prospectively unless there is a clear intention to make them retrospective.
- The legislature's intention to make a law retrospective must be shown clearly and unambiguously in the statute itself.
- The Division Bench's interpretation of the statutory provision will not make the law retrospective.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
- Smt. Usha Mitra and the appellants jointly inherited the tenancy from Sh. S.K. Mitra in 1970.
- The impugned judgment is liable to be set aside as the appellants' tenancy did not expire in 2006 due to the introduction of the 1997 Act.
- These appeals are allowed, and the orders dated 29.06.2022 and 08.12.2022 of the Single Judge and the Division Bench respectively are set aside.

<FACTS>
The High Court of Judicature at Allahabad had passed a final judgment and order dated 12th April 2023 in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 29906 of 2022, quashing the complaint case filed by the appellant against Respondent No.1. The complainant, M/s. R.K. Marble Industries Private Limited, had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, against one Shri Dheerendra Kumar for dishonoring a cheque.
The High Court had passed the order on a perfunctory and erroneous reasoning, stating that the complainant's authorized representative, Sh. Neeraj Kumar, did not have personal knowledge of the facts of the matter.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued before the Supreme Court that the High Court had erred in passing the order on a perfunctory and erroneous reasoning. They contended that the complainant's authorized representative, Sh. Neeraj Kumar, did have personal knowledge of the facts of the matter, as evidenced by the averments made in various documents filed before the trial court.
The Supreme Court was also referred to the decision in TRL Krosaki Refractories Limited (supra), which held that what can be treated as an explicit averment cannot be put in a straightjacket but will have to be gathered from the circumstance and manner in which it has been averred and conveyed, based on the facts of each case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court had passed the order without careful consideration, despite the presence of explicit averments made by the complainant's authorized representative. The Court also noted that the High Court's reasoning was completely unwarranted and incorrect.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court cautioned against the misuse of inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., stating that such powers should be exercised sparingly and with great caution, and not used to interfere with the jurisdiction of lower courts or to scuttle a fair investigation or prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashing the final judgment and order passed by the High Court. The complaint case was restored to the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khurja, Bulandshahar, to be heard and decided on its own merits.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a complaint filed by the respondent (complainant) against the appellant under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 376 (rape), Section 420 (cheating), Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), and Section 506 (criminal intimidation).
The complainant alleges that the appellant had engaged in a consensual relationship for about nine years but later discontinued financial support, leading to the complainant making allegations of cheating and resiling from the promise to marry.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments made by the parties are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the defense (appellant) argued against attaching criminal liability to a long-term consensual relationship turned sour, citing potential abuse of the process of court and the need for each case to be decided on its own facts.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court include:
* The worrying trend of seeking to criminalise consensual relationships that turn sour through invoking criminal jurisprudence.
* The importance of considering human relationships and psychology in each case, as they are dynamic and unpredictable.
* The potential for imputing criminal intent to disturbed civil relationships at a belated stage.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that:
* No prima facie case has been made out against the appellant under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC.
* The FIR and subsequent proceedings were quashed, as no criminal liability could be attached to the appellant's actions.
* Quashing the FIR would not bar the respondent from seeking other remedies available under law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, a Christian by religion, claims to be a Hindu and seeks a Scheduled Caste community certificate for the purpose of employment. The appellant professes Christianity and actively practices the faith by attending church regularly. The case was heard in 2024.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the court is that if the purpose of conversion is largely to derive benefits of reservation but not with any actual belief on the other religion, it cannot be permitted as it will defeat the social ethos of the policy of reservation. The court also emphasized that a person must be genuinely inspired by the principles, tenets, and spiritual thoughts of their chosen religion when converting.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that India is a secular country where every citizen has the right to practice and profess a religion of their choice as guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution. The court also noted that if a person changes their religion, it should be genuinely for spiritual reasons rather than material benefits like reservation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal stating that the conferment of Scheduled caste communal status to the appellant would go against the very object of reservation and amount to fraud on the Constitution. The court held that the evidence presented clearly demonstrates that the appellant professes Christianity and actively practices the faith, making it untenable for her to claim to be a Hindu.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a public servant accused of accepting a bribe. The prosecution presents evidence, including the recovery of bribe money from the respondent's possession. The High Court had acquitted the respondent, but the appeal was filed against the acquittal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the demand and acceptance of the bribe were established beyond doubt, and therefore, the presumption under Section 20 of the Act should be applied to convict the respondent. They also pointed out that the High Court's decision was perverse and not based on the evidence presented.
The defense argued that there was no nexus between the demand for a bribe and the act performed or sought to be performed by the public servant, as required under Section 20 of the Act. They also claimed that the amount demanded was trivial and did not warrant the drawing of any presumption of corruption.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The trial court had initially convicted the respondent, but the High Court acquitted him based on a perceived lack of nexus between the demand for a bribe and the act performed or sought to be performed. The High Court also exercised its discretionary power under Section 20(3) of the Act and declined to draw any presumption.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court, and restored the trial court's judgment. The Court held that the recovery of bribe money from the respondent's possession established the demand and acceptance of the bribe beyond doubt, making it unnecessary to draw any presumption under Section 20 of the Act.
The Court also rejected the defense argument that the amount demanded was trivial, stating that the overall circumstances and evidence should be considered. The Court found the High Court's decision to be perverse and not based on the evidence presented, and exercised its discretion to convict the respondent.
The Supreme Court directed the trial court to take necessary steps to secure the respondent and commit him in prison to undergo the remaining period of sentence, as well as to recover the fine imposed on him.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquisition of land by the State of Haryana for public purposes. The respondents, who own some of the acquired land, challenged the acquisition in court. The High Court quashed the acquisition and directed the State to return the land to its original owners.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (State) argued that the acquisition was necessary for public purposes, including the development of a sports complex. They also contended that the respondents were fully compensated for their land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
The respondents argued that the acquisition was arbitrary and contrary to public interest. They claimed that the land was acquired without following proper procedures and that they were not adequately compensated.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the acquisition was indeed necessary for a public purpose, but it was also necessary to ensure that the acquired land is utilized in accordance with the provisions of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975. The Court also noted that the respondents were entitled to compensation at the same rate as had been granted for similarly located land.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, and directed the State to take possession of the subject-land in accordance with law. The Court also directed the HSVP to commence development works without delay. In case no award for the land owned by the Respondents was passed earlier, the same shall be passed expeditiously, and in any case within a period of 3 (three) months in accordance with the provisions of the 1894 Act.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant against the judgments and orders passed in a criminal trial. The appellant was accused of certain offences, but due to ineffective legal aid provided by the court-appointed advocate, the appellant's rights were allegedly infringed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented on behalf of the appellant include:
- Ineffective legal aid: The appointed advocate did not have sufficient knowledge of criminal laws and procedural laws, which led to a biased trial and infringement of the appellant's fundamental rights.
- Non-compliance with court orders: The Legal Services Authorities were expected to monitor the work of the appointed advocates and ensure that they attend court regularly. However, this was not done in the present case.
- Violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India: The right to defend oneself and a fair trial is guaranteed by the constitution. Effective legal aid must be made available to an accused who cannot engage an advocate on their own.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:
- The importance of effective legal aid in ensuring that the accused receives a fair trial and their fundamental rights are protected.
- The need for proper training and monitoring of court-appointed advocates to ensure they have the necessary knowledge and skills to conduct trials efficiently.
- The State Legal Services Authorities must issue directions to all levels of Legal Services Authorities to monitor the work of appointed advocates and ensure regular attendance in court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the impugned judgments and orders are set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the offences alleged against them, and the bail bonds stand cancelled. A copy of this judgment will be forwarded to all State Legal Services Authorities for necessary measures.

<FACTS>
The plaintiff, Inox, had filed a suit against the defendant for copyright infringement of their "Proprietary Engineering Drawings". The suit also included claims related to "literary work", confidential information, and know-how. The Commercial Court initially rejected the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court held that the question as to whether the original artistic work would fall within the meaning of 'design' under the Designs Act cannot be answered while deciding an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. The Commercial Court's decision was based on a prima facie inquiry into the disclosure of cause of action in the plaint.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case highlights the complexities and nuances of IP law, particularly with regards to the interplay between the Designs Act and the Copyright Act. The High Court emphasized the importance of a thorough examination of the facts and legal principles involved before making a decision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's decision was upheld, and the Commercial Court was directed to deliver its decision on the pending application seeking interim injunction preferred by Inox within two months. The Commercial Court was further directed to conduct trial and discern the true nature of the Proprietary Engineering Drawings based upon the test laid down in paragraph 60 of the judgement, as also the other related IP right infringements claimed by Inox, within a period of one year.

<FACTS>
The Tribunal had returned a finding on issue no.3 that M/s. Hindustan Motors had provided no evidence to show that the vehicle manufactured and owned by it was sold by it to the dealer.
Admittedly, its own employees/officers were in control of the vehicle at the time of accident and, therefore, M/s. Hindustan Motors was held jointly and severally liable for the compensation awarded.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Tribunal's decision was based on the finding that M/s. Hindustan Motors had provided no evidence to show that the vehicle manufactured and owned by it was sold by it to the dealer.
M/s. Hindustan Motors had allowed this part of the award to attain finality by not challenging it through an appeal or cross-objection.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
For exercise of the power under Rule 33 of Order 41 CPC, the overriding consideration is achieving the ends of justice; and one of the limitations on exercise of the power is that part of the decree which essentially ought to have been appealed against or objected to by a party and which that party has permitted to achieve finality cannot be reversed to the advantage of such party.
M/s. Hindustan Motors had allowed the award to attain finality by not challenging it through an appeal or cross-objection, and therefore, it cannot now question this part of the award.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed to the extent that apart from the driver, M/s. Hindustan Motors alone was liable for the compensation awarded.
If the awarded amount has been paid by the appellant, the appellant shall be entitled to recover the same from M/s. Hindustan Motors along with interest at 6% p.a., with effect from the date of payment till the date of recovery.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a dispute over the transfer of property, with the plaintiff seeking to maintain status quo and prevent further encumbrances on the property. The High Court had passed an order allowing the transfer of the property, but the plaintiffs appealed against this decision.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the doctrine of lis pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act (T.P. Act) did not provide a complete panacea against pendente lite transfers. They relied on Rule 1 of Order 39 of the Code, which provides for interim injunctions restraining alienation or sale of the suit property.
The respondents argued that the doctrine of lis pendens was sufficient to prevent further transfers and that the High Court's order was correct.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the property should not change hands any further, considering the nature of the dispute between the parties and the materials on record. The court also noted that Rule 1 of Order 39 of the Code clearly demonstrates that there can be occasions for granting injunctions restraining pendente lite transfers.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed by the court, and the impugned order passed by the High Court was set aside. The respondents were directed to maintain status quo as regards the suit property and not create any further encumbrances over the same in any manner. Any further transfer of the suit property pending the final disposal of the suit shall be subject to lis pendens under Section 52 of the T.P. Act, irrespective of whether such lis pendens has been duly registered by the plaintiffs with the competent authority or not.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over stamp duty on the "Articles of Association" of a company. The respondent had initially paid Rs. 25 lakhs as stamp duty, but later claimed that it should be exempt from paying additional stamp duty after an amendment to the Stamp Act in 2015.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the increase in share capital was a new instrument and therefore subject to additional stamp duty. They also contended that the respondent's claim for exemption was based on incorrect assumptions about the applicability of the amended section of the Stamp Act.
On the other hand, the respondent argued that the instrument "Articles of Association" remained the same and only the increase in share capital was made chargeable by the Legislation after the introduction of the cap. They claimed that the duty already paid should be taken into account and that they were entitled to exemption from paying additional stamp duty.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the Maharashtra Stamp (Amendment) Act, 2015 had introduced a new provision making "increased share capital" chargeable under Article 10 of the Stamp Act. However, the court also observed that this amendment did not have retrospective effect and therefore could not be applied to the respondent's case.
The court also referred to the provisions of Stamp Duty Acts in other States, such as Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, which had different rules for charging stamp duty on Articles of Association.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately upheld the order of the High Court of Bombay and directed the appellants to refund Rs. 25 lakhs paid by the respondent along with interest @ 6% per annum. The court ruled that the instrument "Articles of Association" remained the same and only the increase in share capital was made chargeable by the Legislation after the introduction of the cap.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a group of temporary employees (appellants) who were employed by the State Government in various departments, including the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22. The appellants were denied pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008 and the 6th Central Pay Commission.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that despite being classified as temporary employees, their employment conditions had evolved over time to be similar to those of regular government employees. They cited various administrative orders and Board proceedings that treated them as equivalent to regular government employees.
The appellants also relied on the Supreme Court's judgment in Vinod Kumar (supra), which held that the essence of employment and the rights thereof cannot be determined by the initial terms of appointment, but rather by the actual course of employment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's impugned judgment was set aside for being unsustainable in the eyes of law. The court observed that the denial of pensionary benefits to the appellants was arbitrary and violative of their fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and directed the respondents to extend the benefits of the 6th Central Pay Commission, including pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008, to the appellants in the same terms as their peers in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22.
The court observed that the totality of circumstances indicated that the appellants' employment bore substantial hallmarks of regular government service and that their denial of pensionary benefits was an oversimplification of their employment relationship with the government.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the payment of stamp duty on an agreement for the construction of roads, bridges, etc. under the Build, Operate and Transfer (B.O.T.) scheme. The lessee was required to pay stamp duty at 2% on the amount likely to be spent by the lessee under the agreement. However, a demand was raised on the whole project cost, which was unjustified.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. It is possible that the arguments were discussed during the hearing and are not included in the judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the amount spent by the lessee was approximately 50% of the total cost of the project, but this figure needs to be determined by the Collector (Stamps) / Revenue Officer of the concerned district. The demand raised on the whole project cost would be unjustified if stamp duty is payable only on the amount spent by the lessee.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court partly allowed the appeals and directed the following:
- To determine the amount spent by the lessee under the agreement.
- To raise a fresh demand for stamp duty at 2% of the amount likely to be spent by the lessee.
- If the appellants have deposited the demand raised on the entire project cost, the excess amount would be refunded to them within two months.
- If there is a deficit in stamp duty having not been deposited, the appellants would deposit the same within two months of the fresh demand being raised.
- The Collector (Stamps) / Revenue Officer is directed to calculate the said amount in each case individually and communicate it to the appellants within a period of two months from today.

The case involves land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The land was acquired by NOIDA authorities for a public purpose. The landowners filed appeals challenging the compensation awarded to them. The Miscellaneous Applications were filed by the landowners seeking parity in compensation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:

* The landowners argued that the compensation awarded to them was inadequate and prayed for enhancement of the compensation amount.
* NOIDA authorities contended that the compensation awarded was fair and reasonable and opposed the appeals filed by the landowners.
* The landowners also invoked Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, seeking parity in compensation with other affected parties covered by the same notification.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The court noted that the compensation awarded to the landowners was based on the market value of the land, which was determined by the Collector.
* The court observed that the landowners had not demonstrated compliance with the procedural technicalities of Section 28A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
* The court also noted that the issue of parity in compensation under Section 28A became academic due to the revision of the rate of compensation to INR 403 per sq. yd for all landowners.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The appeals filed by the landowners are allowed in part, and the rate of compensation is enhanced from INR 340 per sq. yd to INR 403 per sq. yd.
* The appeals by NOIDA authorities against the grant of compensation are also allowed in part, and the rate of compensation is reduced for some landowners from INR 449 per sq. yd to INR 403 per sq. yd.
* The enhanced compensation amount shall be deposited with the Reference Court within a period of eight weeks and disbursed to the claimants at the earliest.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the grant of pre-reference interest in an arbitration award. The Contract between the parties does not prohibit the award of pre-reference interest.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the arguments were centered around the interpretation of Section 31(7)(a) and the entitlement to pre-reference interest under the Contract or applicable law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that pendente lite interest is a matter of procedural law, while pre-reference interest is governed by substantive law. Therefore, the grant of pre-reference interest cannot be sourced solely in Section 31(7)(a) but must be based on an agreement between the parties (express or implied), statutory provision, or proof of mercantile usage.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court in so far as it rejected and set aside claim no. 4 awarded by the Arbitrator, as upheld by the District Judge under Section 34. The Court also set aside the Award with respect to claim no. 3 and dismissed the Civil Appeal to this extent. Additionally, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court in so far as it modified claim no. 6, to the extent of rejecting pre-reference interest awarded by the Arbitrator, as upheld by the District Judge under Section 34.

The Election Petition No. 1 of 2021 was filed by the Respondent No. 1 (Election Petitioner) before the High Court.
The Appellant's nomination was accepted, and he won the election.
The Election Petitioner alleged that the Appellant's nomination was improperly accepted, and corrupt practices were committed during the election.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Election Petitioner argued that the Appellant's nomination was improperly accepted because his educational qualification was not correctly stated in the Affidavit in Form-26.
The Election Petitioner also alleged that corrupt practices were committed by the Appellant, specifically "undue influence" under Section 123(2) of the Act.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the acquittal of three accused persons by the trial court. The prosecution's case was based on eyewitness testimony and the recovery of certain weapons from open spaces, which were allegedly pointed out by the accused. However, the trial court had acquitted the accused due to lack of trust in the eyewitness evidence and failure to corroborate it with other evidence. The High Court had reversed this decision and convicted the accused.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the recovery of the weapons was a direct result of the disclosure statements made by the accused, which were recorded by the Investigating Officer (PW-27). They contended that the eyewitness testimony, although vacillating, was sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused. The defense argued that the FIR was a post-investigation document and that there was no corroboration of the eyewitness evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The court observed that the Investigating Officer (PW-27) failed to provide a description of the conversation with the accused, which was recorded in the disclosure statements. Therefore, these disclosure statements could not be read into evidence and the recoveries made thereafter were invalid. The court also noted that no serological opinion was procured to establish the blood group on the recovered weapons.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that neither the disclosure memos nor the recovery of the weapons from open spaces inspired confidence and were wrongly relied upon by the High Court as incriminating material. The court observed that the trial court's decision to acquit the accused was a plausible and justifiable view emanating from the discussion of the evidence available on record. Therefore, the High Court's reversal of this decision was not justified. Consequently, the court acquitted the accused appellants of all charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between Karan Singh (the first plaintiff) and the legal representatives of the first defendant and second to fourth defendants regarding the sale of an undivided share in the suit property. The second plaintiff, Murari Singh, was not interested in getting specific performance, which led to the decree being restricted to the undivided one-half share in favor of only the first plaintiff (Karan Singh). The property is situated in a village and is subject to the Zamindari Abolition Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants' senior counsel include:
- Murari Singh did not institute the suit, which led to the decree for specific performance being restricted to the undivided one-half share in favor of only the first plaintiff (Karan Singh).
- Since the second plaintiff was not interested in getting specific performance, the decree ought to have been restricted to the undivided one-half share in the suit property in favor of only the first plaintiff.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The second plaintiff (Murari Singh) was not interested in getting specific performance, which led to the decree being restricted to the undivided one-half share in favor of only the first plaintiff (Karan Singh).
- As per Section 45 of the Transfer of Property Act, the plaintiffs would be deemed to have equal shares if the agreement to sell does not define their shares.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court includes:
- The impugned decree was modified by directing the legal representatives of the first defendant and second to fourth defendants to execute a sale deed in favor of the first plaintiff (Karan Singh) only to the extent of one-half undivided share in the suit property.
- The defendants shall join the first plaintiff in applying for permission under clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B of the Zamindari Abolition Act to sell the one-half undivided share in the suit land to the first plaintiff within two months from the date of the judgment.
- If the application is rejected, it will be open to the first plaintiff to challenge the order of rejection in accordance with law. If the application for grant of permission is finally rejected, there shall be a decree for refund of the sum of Rs. 7,000/- against the legal representative of the first defendant together with interest.
- The sale deed shall be executed in terms of clause (a) by all the defendants within three months from the date of grant of the permission.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellant bank and respondent no. 1 (a bank) regarding an equitable mortgage created by respondent no. 1 in favor of the appellant bank. The appellant bank had sought to rely on the original share certificate issued by the Society as a valid piece of title deed. However, the High Court got carried away by the fact that the first charge was that of the Central Bank and not of the appellant bank.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The respondent no. 1 had created an equitable mortgage in favor of the appellant bank, which was not brought to the notice of the appellant bank at the time of creation.
- The High Court got carried away by the fact that the first charge was that of the Central Bank and not of the appellant bank, failing to notice the distinction between an 'equitable mortgage' and a 'legal mortgage'.
- The proposition of law is that though the transaction evidenced by the prior unregistered document is valid in itself, yet any title or interest created by it is liable to be defeated under the rule of priority by a valid later and legal sale or mortgage evidenced by a duly registered document.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- The original share certificate issued by the Society can be considered as a valid piece of title deed for creating an equitable mortgage.
- The High Court's order is not correct and deserves to be set aside.
- An amount of Rs. 51 lakh is lying deposited with the DRT maintained in an escrow account, which should now be disbursed along with interest in favor of the appellant bank.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed in the case includes:
- The appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed.
- The impugned Order passed by the High Court is hereby set aside.
- Since the respondent no. 1 had failed to bring the factum of its 'equitable mortgage' to the notice of the appellant bank, the respondent no. 1 bank is not entitled to enforce the same qua the recovery proceeds of the appellant bank herein.

<FACTS>
The case deals with reassessment notices issued by the Income Tax Department. The Department had issued 90,000 reassessment notices under the old regime between April 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021. The assesses challenged these notices in various High Courts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the assesses argued that the reassessment notices were invalid as they were issued after the expiry of the statutory time limit. They relied on a Supreme Court judgment (Ashish Agarwal v. Union of India) which had stayed the operation of the reassessment notices and directed the assessing officers to supply relevant information and material to the assesses within two weeks.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Courts had rendered judgments in favor of the assesses, holding that the reassessment notices were time-barred. However, the Supreme Court's judgment (Ashish Agarwal v. Union of India) had a significant impact on the outcome of these cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by the Revenue and set aside the judgments of the High Courts to the extent they relied on the observations made in this judgment. The Court held that:
* The directions issued in Ashish Agarwal v. Union of India would extend to all 90,000 reassessment notices issued under the old regime during the period April 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021.
* The time during which the show cause notices were deemed to be stayed was from the date of issuance of the deemed notice between April 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021, till the supply of relevant information and material by the assessing officers to the assesses in terms of the directions issued by the Supreme Court.
* The time limit for issuing reassessment notices under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act was extended till June 30, 2021.
* All reassessment notices issued beyond the surviving period are time-barred and liable to be set aside.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent-employee was removed from service by the Disciplinary Authority on 28.09.1993. The removal order was challenged by the respondent, and a single judge bench upheld the challenge. However, the impugned judgment of the division bench is being challenged in this appeal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments put forth by the appellants are that the removal order was valid and that there was no prejudice caused to the respondent-employee due to minor deficiencies in the process. The appellants also argued that the respondent's conduct warranted the punishment awarded, as he had not controverted or denied the factual position based on official documentation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include that there was no difference between the earlier order of removal and the Removal Order passed subsequently. The court also noted that the respondent's representation had been considered in the fresh Removal Order, albeit not in as many words. Additionally, the court observed that while it is desirable for Disciplinary Authorities to engage with representations/submissions of delinquent employees, minor deficiencies in the process do not warrant judicial interdiction.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court quashes and sets aside the impugned judgment, restoring the Removal Order dated 28.09.1993 passed by the Disciplinary Authority. The court also directed that payments, if any, already made to the respondent in the interregnum shall not be recovered by the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a bail application filed by the appellant under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The charge sheet against the appellant contains allegations of commission of offences under the UAPA. However, upon reviewing the charge sheet and witness statement Z, it is found that there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against the appellant of commission of offences punishable under the UAPA is prima facie true.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant's counsel include:
- There are not enough grounds to believe that the accusations against the appellant are true, making bail a suitable option.
- The chargesheet and witness statement Z do not provide sufficient evidence to support the allegations.
- The Special Court and High Court did not objectively consider the material in the charge sheet.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:
- The focus was more on the activities of PFI, which may have led to a lack of appreciation for the appellant's case.
- The duty of the courts is to consider cases for grant of bail in accordance with the law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
- The impugned orders are set aside, and the appeal is allowed.
- The appellant is directed to be enlarged on bail on terms and conditions fixed by the Special Court.
- The Special Court shall hear counsel for the respondent before fixing the terms and conditions.
- The tentative findings recorded in this judgment are only for considering the prayer for bail and will have no bearing on the trial and cases of co-accused.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiffs had entered into an agreement to buy a property from the defendants for Rs. 12,000 as advance money on May 24, 1981. The sale deed was supposed to be executed and registered by June 10, 1982. However, the plaintiffs failed to clear the balance sale consideration, and the defendants refused to execute the sale deed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiffs claimed that they were always ready and willing to get the sale deed executed and registered. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs never had the funds available to clear the balance sale consideration and were merely interested in blocking the property to sell it at a higher price to third parties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The conduct of the plaintiffs throughout the case gave credence to the defendants' contention that the plaintiffs were middlemen interested in making a profit. The court observed that the plaintiffs never had the funds available to clear the balance sale consideration and were not genuinely interested in buying the property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned order, and dismissed the suit. However, it directed the defendants (appellants) to compensate the plaintiffs (respondents) by paying an amount of Rs. 24 lakhs in lieu of the advance money and further Rs. 6 lakhs as cost of litigation. The total amount of Rs. 30 lakhs was to be paid within three months, and proof of payment was to be filed before the court within four months.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCTITONS>
The case is about a writ petition filed by the respondent against an order of dismissal.
</FUNCTIONS>

<FACTS>
The respondent was dismissed from service after being accused of misconduct. The proposal to initiate disciplinary proceedings, including the draft charge-sheet, had been approved by the Chief Minister. However, the High Court interfered with the order of dismissal on the ground that the charge-sheet did not have the approval of the competent authority.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent's writ petition was allowed by the Single Judge and upheld by the Division Bench. The respondent relied on two previous cases (B.V. Gopinath vs. State of U.P. and another case) to argue that the charge-sheet did not have the approval of the competent authority. The respondent's counsel, Dr. Singhvi, also argued that the respondent had been out of service for nearly 8 years, which was sufficient punishment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the Single Judge and Division Bench had both erred in interfering with the order of dismissal on a specious plea. The court noted that the proposal to initiate disciplinary proceedings, including the draft charge-sheet, had been approved by the Chief Minister. The court also observed that directing the respondent's reinstatement despite finding no error in the proceedings drawn up against him would render the valid dismissal order ineffective and inoperative.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned order of the Division Bench as well as the judgment and order of the Single Judge. The court held that the respondent's writ petition was fundamentally incorrect and patently illegal. The court also granted liberty to the respondent to appeal against the impugned order of dismissal or seek a revision thereof by filing an appeal/memorial within a period of one month from the date of pronouncement of this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a divorce and permanent alimony dispute between the respondent-husband and the appellant-wife. The parties have been married for an unspecified period, and their daughter is mentioned to be not adopted by the husband. The wife has put forth a demand of Rs. 5-7 Crores as one-time settlement, while the husband offered Rs. 50 Lakhs towards permanent alimony.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are:
* The wife's demand for one-time settlement is exceptionally high but not unreasonable considering her expenses and living standards.
* The husband has a legal obligation to maintain his former wife after the dissolution of marriage, despite her being employed and having assets.
* A balanced and fair amount for permanent alimony would be Rs. 2 Crores, covering all pending and future claims.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case are:
* The respondent-husband has obligations towards three dependants, his own expenses, and certain bank loans, but he also has the financial capacity to maintain his former wife.
* A one-time settlement between the parties is explored as an option, and the court considers it a viable solution for resolving their dispute.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in this case states that:
* The appeals are allowed, and the orders and judgments of the courts below are set aside.
* Any pending cases be disposed of accordingly, and the decree of divorce is granted in exercise of the court's power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
* The respondent-husband shall pay Rs. 2 Crores towards permanent alimony to the appellant-wife within a period of four months.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the liability to pay customs duty under Section 125(2) of the Customs Act, 1962. The appellant had imported goods and was granted exemption from customs duty under a notification subject to certain conditions. However, it was found that the importer had violated these conditions, and an order was passed for payment of customs duty along with an imposition of fine in lieu of confiscation of goods.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that since the liability to pay customs duty arose under Section 125(2), the calculation, determination, or assessment of such duty could not be made under Section 28. Additionally, they contended that even if Section 28 was applicable, the interest on delayed payment of duty would not be attracted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the liability to pay customs duty arose under Section 125(2), and therefore, a notice under Section 28 is not necessary. The court also noted that the provisions of Section 28 would come into operation for assessing and determining the duty and other charges payable with respect to goods redeemed under Section 125(2).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the interest liability under Section 28AB is also attracted, as the interest on delayed payment of duty arises under this provision. The court upheld the decision of the High Court in Writ Petition Lodging No. 1387 of 2009 dated 29.08.2009 and disposed of the present Civil Appeal No. 1024 of 2014.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the Roadways Karamchari Sanyukta Parishad (RKSP) and the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC). The RKSP filed a writ petition seeking pension benefits for its members who were promoted to pensionable posts after 27.08.1982. The UPSRTC opposed the petition, arguing that only those employees who were absorbed from the state government service would be entitled to pension.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the parties:
- RKSP argued that the High Court's order, which granted pension benefits to members of RKSP promoted after 27.08.1982, was correct and should be upheld.
- UPSRTC contended that only state government employees absorbed into the Corporation would be entitled to pension, and those who were not holding pensionable posts prior to their deputation or absorption in the Corporation are not entitled to pension.

Observations:
- The High Court's order, which granted pension benefits to members of RKSP promoted after 27.08.1982, was based on the interpretation that only state government employees absorbed into the Corporation would be entitled to pension.
- However, this interpretation was challenged by UPSRTC, arguing that the service conditions in the erstwhile Roadways did not provide for pension benefits.

The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which reviewed the High Court's order and the arguments presented by both parties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations from the court:
- The court observed that only state government employees absorbed into the Corporation would be entitled to pension, as per the Government Order dated 05.07.1972.
- The court noted that the service conditions in the erstwhile Roadways did not provide for pension benefits, and therefore, those employees who were promoted after 27.08.1982 are not entitled to pension.

The court also observed that employees who were promoted between 1972 and 1981 are getting pension in view of a Government Order dated 03.02.1984.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Judgment:
- The Supreme Court set aside the order passed by the Division Bench and the learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court under the impugned judgment (s).

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the termination of a police constable's services due to his involvement in a criminal case. The respondent was appointed as a constable in a Law Enforcement Agency and had been aware of an FIR registered against him with Barnhal Police Station, Mainpuri, Uttar Pradesh. He failed to disclose this information while applying for the job.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the respondent's appointment was null and void due to his deliberate withholding of information about the criminal case. They also contended that as a constable in a Law Enforcement Agency, the standard of rectitude required is higher and more rigorous, and the respondent failed to meet this standard.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The learned Single Judge had interfered with the orders passed by the Disciplinary Authority terminating the services of the respondent. The Appellate Court also fell into error in observing that it was incumbent for the appellants to prove that the pendency of the criminal case was within the knowledge of the respondent.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that there was no occasion for the learned Single Judge to have interfered with the orders passed by the Disciplinary Authority. The Appellate Court's observation was also incorrect, and the records spoke to the contrary. The respondent does not deserve any latitude as he had been aware of the FIR registered against him and failed to disclose this information while applying for the job. The appellants exercised their discretion as employers in a reasonable manner, and the termination of the respondent's services was justified.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of the High Court dated 26th September, 2011, which set aside the order of the Trial Court dated 19th October, 2010. The Trial Court had admitted a document in evidence despite being insufficiently stamped. The appellant challenged this decision before the High Court, but it was upheld.
The case revolves around sections 33 and 34 of the 1857 Act (now 1957 Act), which deal with the requirement for instruments to be duly stamped or penalty to be paid for insufficient stamping.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned counsel for the respondent referred to section 58 of the 1957 Act, but it was held that its applicability was not attracted since the Trial Court did neither hold the document as duly stamped nor as one not requiring a stamp.
The Trial Court's order dated 19th October, 2010, was passed in exercise of its inherent power under section 151, CPC, to do justice and prevent abuse of the process of court. The Trial Court had admitted failure on its part to apply judicial mind when admitting the document in evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The revenue would suffer huge loss if courts fail to discharge their duty per provisions like section 33 of the 1957 Act. Compliance with substantive and procedural requirements of a statute akin to the 1957 Act is essential for upholding the sanctity of the legal framework governing stamp duty.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed without any order for costs. The order of the Trial Court dated 19th October, 2010, was restored. The Trial Court was expected to proceed expeditiously and in accordance with law after this decision.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court entertained and allowed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution despite an effective alternative remedy being available to the aggrieved person. The appeal was filed against the order, which had serious adverse impact on the right of banks and other financial institutions to recover their dues.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court erred in entertaining and allowing the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution despite an effective alternative remedy being available. They relied on the principles enunciated in the cases of Chhabil Dass Agarwal v. State of U.P., (2014) 1 SCC 603, where it was held that the High Court will not entertain a petition under Article 226 if an effective alternative remedy is available to the aggrieved person or the statute itself contains a mechanism for redressal of grievances.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that despite repeated pronouncements by this Court, the High Courts continue to ignore the availability of statutory remedies and exercise jurisdiction under Article 226. The court noted that the principles enunciated in Chhabil Dass Agarwal (supra) still hold the field.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed, and the impugned order passed by the High Court was quashed and set aside. Writ Petition No. 5275 of 2021 was dismissed with costs quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- imposed upon the Borrower.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the validity of certain provisions in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 2015, specifically the calculation of royalty on royalty in the "average sale price" by virtue of the Explanation(s) to Rule 38 of the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 2016, and Rule 45 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 2017.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the provisions in question result in cascading impact of royalty on royalty, which is discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. The respondents are already in seisin of the anomaly in computation of royalty and are considering a policy change based on the grounds raised by the petitioners.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that since the respondents are already aware of the anomaly in computation of royalty and are reconsidering their policy, no further action is required at this stage. However, the petitioners reserve the right to challenge the final policy decision taken by the respondents after completing the consultation process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court grants the respondents a period of 2 months from the date of pronouncement of the judgment to conclude the public consultation process and take a final decisive call on the matter. The Registry is directed to notify this matter before an appropriate Bench after a period of two months from the date of pronouncement of this judgment to report compliance with the directions.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over pay parity between the posts of SDI/ABSA and DBSA in the State's Education Department. The private respondents were redesignated as DBSA, but their pay scales were not revised accordingly. They claimed that they should have been entitled to the higher pay scale from 2006, while the appellants argued that the redesignation was only a matter of nomenclature and did not affect their emoluments.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The private respondents' argument is based on the principle of pay parity, which requires that employees in similar positions with the same responsibilities should receive equal remuneration. They cited the 2011 Order, which granted them a higher pay scale, and argued that this order was applicable to them from 2006.
The appellants argued that the redesignation was only a matter of nomenclature and did not affect their emoluments. They also pointed out that the private respondents had received payment for several years under the previous designation and that any increase in pay would be retroactive and unjustified.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the redesignation of posts can have significant implications for employees, including changes to their pay scales. However, it also noted that the appellants had taken steps to address the issue by granting a higher pay scale in 2011.
The court further observed that prolonged litigation over pay parity can lead to manifest injustice and hardship for parties involved.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal in part, setting aside the impugned judgment of the Division Bench and that of the Single Judge. It approved the 2011 Order in its entirety and held that the private respondents and their colleagues in the same cadre were entitled to the pay scale granted by the Government Order notionally from 2006 and actually from 2008.
The court also directed that any payment made to the respondents more than what they were entitled to with effect from 2008 should not be recovered from them. The arrears of pay or pension, if not already paid, were to be paid within four months along with interest at 7% per annum.
Finally, the court emphasized that its order was restricted to employees of the State Education Department and would not set a precedent for other government departments.

The respondent was granted accelerated promotion to the post of Joint Secretary from 5th March, 2003. However, he filed a petition seeking retrospective promotion from 29th July, 1997. The appellant-Board rejected his plea citing administrative exigencies and the reduction in sanctioned posts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent's argument was that merely completing the Kal Awadhi for promotion entitled him to appointment from the date the post fell vacant. He relied on the Board's Resolution dated 26th December, 1991.
The appellant-Board's argument was that the reduction in sanctioned posts due to administrative exigencies meant there was no vacancy for the respondent to be promoted to the next higher post at the time of his completion of Kal Awadhi.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the action of the Board was guided by administrative exigencies and not malafides or colourable exercise of power. The Resolution dated 26th December, 1991 for fixing the Kal Awadhi was only directory in nature and cannot be treated as statutory.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that merely completing the Kal Awadhi does not entitle an employee to appointment from the date the post fell vacant. The respondent's plea for shifting his date of promotion to 29th July, 1997 was rejected. The impugned order dated 20th October 2011 was set aside and the order dated 3rd October, 2007 passed by the learned Single Judge was restored.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Mysore Sales, a company that sold vending rights to liquor vendors (contractors) through auctions. The contractors were then required to pay tax under Section 206C of the Income Tax Act. However, Mysore Sales claimed that it was not liable for paying tax under this section. A writ petition was filed by the contractors against Mysore Sales and the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS) to quash the orders passed under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* Whether Section 206C of the Income Tax Act is applicable to Mysore Sales, considering that it sold vending rights through auctions and did not deduct tax at source.
* Whether the liquor vendors (contractors) can be termed as "buyers" within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C of the Income Tax Act.
* Whether the assessing officer was justified in passing orders under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act without affording a reasonable opportunity of hearing to Mysore Sales.

The court held that Section 206C is not applicable to Mysore Sales and that the contractors cannot be termed as "buyers" within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C. The court also observed that principles of natural justice require notice and hearing before passing an order under Section 206C(6).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* That Section 206C of the Income Tax Act is not applicable to Mysore Sales.
* That the contractors cannot be termed as "buyers" within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C.
* That principles of natural justice require notice and hearing before passing an order under Section 206C(6).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states that:

"The question framed in paragraph 3 above, is answered in the negative by holding that Section 206C of the Income Tax Act is not applicable in respect of Mysore Sales and that the liquor vendors (contractors) who bought the vending rights from the appellant on auction cannot be termed as “buyers” within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C of the Income Tax Act. We also hold that the High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petitions and consequently, the writ appeal challenging the orders dated 17.01.2001."

The court allowed the civil appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru in Writ Appeal No. 7926/2003 and connected writ appeals.

The consequential demand notices issued under Section 156 of the Income Tax Act are also quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The facts of the case are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context and the discussion, it appears that the case involves a person (referred to as "the appellant") who is accused of committing murder.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's argument is impliedly supported by the court's findings, which are discussed in detail in the judgment section. The key points from the arguments can be inferred as follows:

* The nature and severity of the crime (murder) is emphasized throughout the discussion.
* The court notes that the use of a weapon, the number of gunshots fired, and the location of the shots on the victim's body all point to a premeditated and intentional act of killing.
* The court rejects the possibility of the case being classified as "culpable homicide not amounting to murder" due to the lack of evidence supporting this claim.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the facts of the present case do not support any of the exceptions to Section 300 of the IPC, including Exception 1 (grave and sudden provocation).
* The court notes that the concept of "reasonableness" in determining whether a person has lost their self-control due to provocation is a matter of interpretation and depends on various factors such as cultural, social, and emotional background.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
"The facts of the present case do not even remotely make out any case under Exception 1 to Section 300 of the IPC, or under any other Exception(s) to Section 300 of IPC."
"The interim order granting bail to the appellant hereby stands vacated and the appellant is hereby directed to surrender before the trial court within four weeks from today. A copy of this Judgment shall be sent to the Trial Court to ensure that the appellant surrenders and undergoes the remaining part of his sentence."
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dishonour of cheque dispute. The respondent-accused was alleged to have issued a cheque, which was subsequently dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The complainant filed a complaint against the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the accused had issued a cheque with knowledge that there were insufficient funds in his account, and therefore, he could be held liable for dishonouring the cheque. The defence argued that the complainant had provided incorrect information about the account details, which led to the cheque being dishonoured.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that there was no evidence of any conspiracy or ill-intent on the part of the accused in issuing the cheque. The court also noted that the defence had raised a valid point regarding the incorrect account details provided by the complainant, which led to the cheque being dishonoured.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that there was no perversity or lack of evidence in the case of the respondent-accused. The concurrent findings of the lower courts were affirmed, and it was observed that non-interference was warranted in light of the principles laid down by earlier judgments.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a fatal incident where two individuals, the deceased and PW-5, were stabbed. The incident occurred in the residence of Asgarali (the father of Hussainbhai) due to a matrimonial dispute between his sister and brother-in-law Abbasbhai. Hussainbhai, who was 18 years old at the time, was emotionally upset seeing his sister allegedly ill-treated by her in-laws. The tension built up since morning as Abbasbhai insisted that his wife Oneja should come to his house and then insisted on the cupboard key of the Ahmedabad house.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- Hussainbhai's defense that he was emotionally upset due to the matrimonial dispute and acted in the heat of the moment.
- The High Court's alteration of the conviction from Section 304 Part I IPC to Section 304 II IPC, considering the incident occurred in the heat of the moment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- The incident was not premeditated and occurred inside the residence of Asgarali (spilling over onto the street).
- There were only two stab wounds each on the stomach of the deceased and PW-5, with the knife not directed at the upper portion of their bodies.
- The High Court noted that neither party could control their anger, leading to the fateful incident.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court includes:
- Conviction maintained under Section 304 Part II IPC for Hussainbhai Asgarali Lokhandwala.
- Sentence modified to the period of incarceration already undergone by him.
- The appellant is directed to be released forthwith, if his detention is not required in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a contempt petition filed by the Petitioner Company against the respondents/authorities for proceeding with recovery proceedings despite the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) being pointed out to their notice. The Petitioner Company was part of a batch specifically dealt with by this Court, and the law laid down by this Court in the case of Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) is clear and unambiguous.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Petitioner Company's arguments were based on the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra), which held that the satisfaction arrived at by the Adjudicating Authority under Section 31 of the Code was vitiated when the State Tax Officer had raised a claim before the CoC, but it was not taken into consideration by the CoC. The Petitioner Company argued that the facts in the present case are distinguishable from the facts in Rainbow Papers Limited (supra), and the respondents/authorities could not have proceeded with the recovery proceedings despite the judgment of this Court being pointed out to their notice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include that the continuation of the proceedings by the respondents/authorities even after the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) was specifically brought to their notice is contemptuous in nature. However, the court does not propose to take any stern action against the respondents/contemnors as they are entitled to benefit of doubt.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court states that the demand notices issued by the contemnors on the Petitioner Company and all proceedings pursuant thereto are held to be illegal and the same are quashed and set aside. The contempt petition is disposed of accepting unconditional apology of the contemnors.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNDED BY THE CONTESTANT'S COURT CASE>

The case in question is a bail application, with the court granting bail to an individual based on two grounds:

<FACTS>
The individual has been implicated in a case based on statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act, which are entirely inadmissible according to the decision of the Supreme Court in Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu.
Bail was granted relying upon the decision in paragraph 15 of the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court considered that the bail conditions imposed by the High Court were onerous and unnecessary, given that the individual had already been granted bail on merits.
The court also noted that the condition of obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission was impossible for the accused to comply with, and therefore should be deleted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the decision in paragraph 15 of the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee case does not necessitate the imposition of all the onerous conditions mentioned therein.
The court also noted that the individual has no right to compel the Embassy/High Commission to issue a certificate, and therefore the condition should be deleted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed that two conditions in the order granting bail to the appellant, namely obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission and dropping a pin of Google Maps, shall stand deleted.
The case was listed on 15 July 2024 for passing final orders after considering the compliances made by the appellant so far.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellants and Respondents entered into an Agreement in 2014 for the purchase of a flat. The Respondents sought cancellation of the allotment due to a sharp decline in property prices. The National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) directed the Appellant to refund Rs.51,12,310/-, which included interest on the amount.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants relied on the judgment of this Court in Maula Bux (supra), where it was held that if the forfeiture of earnest money under a contract is reasonable, it does not fall within Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The NCDRC had consistently taken the view that 10% of the BSP (Basic Sale Price) is a reasonable amount to be forfeited as earnest money.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court held that if the forfeiture of earnest money under a contract is reasonable, it does not fall within Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The NCDRC's view that 10% of the BSP is a reasonable amount to be forfeited as earnest money was consistently taken by the Commission.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was partly allowed. The Appellant was directed to pay Rs.12,02,955/- to the Respondents within six weeks from the date of the judgment. The NCDRC's direction for refunding interest on the amount was set aside.

<FACTS>
The case involves an individual with a disability who was denied admission to the MBBS course at AIIMS, Nagpur. The Disability Assessment Board of AIIMS, Nagpur conducted an assessment and submitted a report on August 13, 2024, which was challenged by the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant's lawyer argued for the rights of individuals with disabilities to access medical education and the need for reasonable accommodations.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Disability Assessment Board failed to apply statutory and regulatory standards while assessing the individual's disability, leading to a flawed report. The court also noted that the existing guidelines for admitting persons with disabilities into medical courses were inadequate and needed revision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the Nagpur bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. The court ordered the creation of a supernumerary seat for the appellant at AIIMS, Nagpur, subject to certain conditions. The court also directed the second respondent to issue fresh guidelines for admitting persons with disabilities into medical courses, which should include reasonable accommodations and comply with contemporary advancements in disability justice.

<FACTS>
The election in question took place in the year 2021. A disparity was found in the count of votes informed to the appellant and that finally disclosed in the official form, relating to 19 votes. The margin of victory of the respondent was 37 votes.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The argument made is that there should be a recount of the votes due to the disparity in the count of votes. It is also mentioned that three out of four candidates have doubts regarding the propriety of the election and would support a recount of votes.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It has come on record that deliberate attempts were made to benefit the ultimate victor, such as the use of police force to remove the appellant from the vicinity of the polling area. The diary of the Presiding Officer of the polling booths could not be found despite a concerted effort.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court has set aside the judgment of the High Court passed in Writ-C No.35734 of 2022 and restored the order dated 31st October 2022 passed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in Election Petition No.02010/2021, which directed a recount of the votes. The appeal is allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction and sentence of an appellant in a murder case. The prosecution's evidence relies on an extra-judicial confession made by the accused to several witnesses, including PW-3 and PW-6. However, the testimonies of these witnesses suffer from material contradictions and lack credibility.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the extra-judicial confession made by the accused is sufficient evidence to convict him of the crime. The defense, on the other hand, contends that the confession lacks credibility due to inconsistencies in the testimonies of PW-3 and PW-6, who failed to mention crucial details during their police statements under Section 161 CrPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the prosecution's evidence is based solely on the extra-judicial confession, which lacks corroboration from any other circumstances. The testimonies of PW-3 and PW-6 are contradicted by their previous police statements, raising concerns about their credibility.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court sets aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant due to the weak circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution. The extra-judicial confession is deemed unreliable due to the contradictions in the testimonies of PW-3 and PW-6, which strike at the root of the prosecution's case. The court rules that suspicion alone cannot substitute for hard evidence, and the appellant must be given the benefit of doubt.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the valuation of goods imported by various Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) under the Central Excise Act, 1944. The OMCs had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Central Government for the purchase of petroleum products at a certain price. However, the Commissioner of Central Excise Nashik issued orders determining the duty liability on the imported goods using Rule 11 read with Rule 7 of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 2000. The OMCs appealed to the Tribunal, which allowed their appeals.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the extended period of limitation could not be invoked as there was no suppression of facts by them. They also contended that Rule 4 of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 2000, is the correct provision to be applied for valuation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Tribunal found that the MOU was suppressed and therefore, Section 11AC will apply. However, in view of the findings recorded on the issue of the invocation of the extended period of limitation, the penalty could not have been imposed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, setting aside the entire demand. The Court held that the extended period of limitation could not be invoked and therefore, the valuation should have been done using Rule 4 of the Central Excise Valuation Rules, 2000. The Court also observed that there was no allegation made by the Revenue of fraud, collusion or any wilful mis-statement on the part of the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the Appellant against the impugned Judgment dated 27th April, 2018, and decrees dated 10th May, 2018 and 09th May, 2024. The Agreement to Sell between the Appellant and Respondent No.1-buyer was challenged. The Appellant claimed that the sale consideration amount of Rs.24,61,000/- (Rupees Twenty Four Lakh Sixty One Thousand) deposited by the Respondent No.1-buyer should be refunded.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* The Agreement to Sell cannot be specifically enforced as it was not registered under the Registration Act, 1908, and thus is void under Section 17 of the Act.
* The Respondent No.1-buyer suppressed a material fact by refusing to accept an account payee cheque sent by the Appellant, thereby disentitling them from obtaining discretionary relief of specific performance.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
* The court relied on the principle that where the plaintiff is shown to have materially misled the court or abused its process, or attempted to do so, the discretionary relief of specific performance can be denied to them.
* The court also considered the test for determining what constitutes a material fact, suppression of which would disentitle the suitor to obtain a discretionary relief.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in the case is as follows:
* The present appeal is allowed, and the impugned Judgment dated 27th April, 2018, as well as decrees dated 10th May, 2018, and 09th May, 2024 are set aside.
* The sale deed executed in favor of Respondent No.1-buyer in pursuance of the impugned judgments is declared as null and void.
* The Appellant is directed to refund the balance sale consideration amount of Rs.24,61,000/- (Rupees Twenty Four Lakh Sixty One Thousand) deposited by Respondent No.1-buyer in pursuance to the impugned judgment and decrees.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case deals with two appeals filed against the order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The first appeal is related to a company called "M/S. Amrapali", and the second appeal is related to another company, but the details are not provided in the given text. 
The orders were passed by the NCLT on July 20, 2023, and the appeals were filed beyond the stipulated period of 30 days.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
No explicit arguments are mentioned in the given text, but it can be inferred that the appellants sought to condone the delay in filing the appeals. However, the NCLAT rejected this request due to lack of sufficient cause for not approaching them within the stipulated time under Section 61(2) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The NCLAT had already passed an order on January 18, 2024, which was upheld by the Supreme Court. The court observed that the appeals were filed beyond the period of limitation, and no application for obtaining a certified copy of the order was made.
The court also noted that even if the exemption from filing a certified copy is claimed under Rule 22 of the NCLAT Rules, it cannot be done as a matter of right. The benefit of Section 12(2) of the Limitation Act can only be availed if an application for obtaining a certified copy has been filed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld the order of the NCLAT and dismissed the appeals due to their being filed beyond the stipulated period. The court also agreed with the NCLAT's observation that there was no sufficient cause for not approaching them within the time limit.
No orders were made on costs, and any pending applications were disposed of.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a prosecution against an appellant who is accused of certain offenses. The prosecution was initiated by the police and later transferred to the trial court. However, the competent authority (BIS) refused to grant sanction for the prosecution of the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent-State and the complainant argued that lack of grant of sanction by the concerned authority within relevant time would amount to "deemed sanction" for prosecution. They relied on judgments of the Supreme Court in Vineet Narain and Subramanian Swamy to support their argument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court erred in not considering the fact that the sanction for prosecution was not granted by the competent authority under Section 197 of the CrPC. The competent authority eventually denied sanction for the prosecution of the appellant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the learned Magistrate was not right in taking cognizance of the offense against the appellant without there being a sanction for prosecution granted by the competent authority. Since BIS refused to grant sanction, the prosecution against the appellant could not have been sustained.
The Supreme Court further observed that Section 197 of CrPC does not envisage a concept of "deemed sanction". The judgments relied upon by the respondent-State and the complainant did not lay down any such notion of deemed sanction for prosecution.
The Court quashed the chargesheet, summoning order, and consequent steps taken by the trial court against the appellant. The appeal was allowed in the aforesaid terms.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a group of candidates who were recruited under a notification dated 21.10.2022 for the post of teachers in a government school. The candidates had completed their D.El.Ed examination in the year 2020-22, which was conducted after the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the recruitment process was challenged by some candidates who claimed that they did not possess the required qualifications as per the notification.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellants were:
* The recruitment notification dated 21.10.2022 was illegal and arbitrary as it did not specify a cut-off date for the D.El.Ed examination.
* The candidates who had completed their D.El.Ed examination in 2020-22 did not possess the required qualifications as per the notification.
* The trial court's decision to allow the recruitment process to proceed was incorrect.

On the other hand, the respondents argued that:
* The recruitment notification dated 21.10.2022 was legal and valid, and it had been issued in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations.
* The candidates who had completed their D.El.Ed examination in 2020-22 were eligible for recruitment as per the notification.
* The trial court's decision to allow the recruitment process to proceed was correct.

The Supreme Court also considered the principles laid down in Bhupinderpal Singh (supra), which held that the qualifications must be possessed as per those prescribed in the rules or the notification, and in the absence of both, by reference to the last date appointed for receiving the applications.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that:
* There was no illegality and arbitrariness in the actual recruitment notification dated 21.10.2022.
* The recruitment process commenced under the relevant rules and as per the directions of the single Judge of the High Court disposing of the writ petition.
* The recruitment notification dated 21.10.2022 was not challenged by anyone.

The Supreme Court also noted that similar circumstances existed in Bhupinderpal Singh (supra), where this Court exercised its power and jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution to validate and legitimise the recruitment process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
* The appeals were allowed, and the judgment of the division bench in M.A.T. No. 1725 of 2022 dated 11.04.2023 was set aside.
* The recruitment process which commenced in the notification dated 21.10.2022 must proceed further, and the Board must take immediate steps for concluding the recruitment process as expeditiously as possible.

The Supreme Court also exercised its power and jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice for the parties.

Not explicitly stated. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the appellants argued for the payment of interest on the retained amount, citing the principle that when money is received without right and retained for a long time, interest is payable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
- The retention of the said amount was for a long time.
- The respondents could not decline to refund the amount.
- The appellants were left with no other option but to approach the High Court.

The case involves an appeal against an impugned order related to a dispute between the borrower and respondent. The appellant is not a 'consumer' in terms of the Act, and the existence of the Tripartite Agreement is doubtful.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court cites precedents such as Emaar-3 [Emaar MGF Land Ltd. v Aftab Singh, (2019) 12 SCC 751: (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 652] and M Hemalatha Devi to argue that even in a consumer dispute under the Act, arbitration can be opted for/resorted to at the exclusive choice of the 'consumer' alone. The court also notes that the appellant is not a 'consumer' in terms of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The impugned order cannot be sustained, and on an overall circumspection of the facts and circumstances of the case coupled with a survey of the precedents, the appeal is allowed.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appellants, who were disqualified for the post of Food Safety Officer (FSO) under Advertisement No. 18 of 2023 issued by JPSC. The appellants had applied for the post but were not selected due to their educational qualifications. They approached the High Court and later the Supreme Court to challenge their disqualification.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the appellants is that they possess post-graduate degrees in subjects covered under Clause 2.1.3 of the Food Safety and Standard Rules (FSSR) 2011, which makes them eligible for the post of FSO. They relied on the case of Parvaiz Ahmad Parry to support their claim.
The respondents argued that the appellants did not meet the minimum educational qualification required for the post as specified in the advertisement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Central Government had amended the FSSR in 2022, making Bachelor's Degree or Master's Degree or Doctorate Degree in specific subjects a valid qualification for the post of FSO. This change was noted by the Court.
The Court observed that the appellants were not given an opportunity to participate in the interview process and were disqualified without being heard.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the appellants' disqualification was unjustified, considering their educational qualifications and the amendments made to the FSSR in 2022. The Court allowed the appeal and ordered the respondents to allow the appellants to participate in the interview process.
The Court further directed the respondents to create supernumerary posts if necessary to accommodate the appellants who would be allowed to partake in the recruitment process from the stage they were disqualified, i.e., from the interview stage. If the appellants succeed and are placed at par or higher in merit compared to the last successful candidate in the particular category, they shall be offered appointment effective from the date of publication of the first select list in the recruitment process 2016.
The Court clarified that since the selected candidates were never impleaded and heard in the proceedings before the High Court or in this Court, appropriate direction has to be given to ensure that their seniority position is not disturbed at this belated stage. It was provided that the successful candidates from amongst the appellants shall be placed below the last candidate selected and appointed in the subject selection process.
Finally, the Court clarified that in case the appellants succeed and are offered appointment, they shall not be entitled to back wages but shall be entitled to all service benefits on a notional basis.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the recruitment process and its various stages. The key events mentioned in the text include:
- Issuance of an advertisement calling for applications, marking the commencement of the recruitment process.
- Placement of candidates in a select list based on their eligibility criteria.
- Filling up of vacancies as the final stage of the recruitment process.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The eligibility criteria for being placed in the Select List cannot be changed midway through the recruitment process unless permitted by extant Rules or the advertisement.
- Any changes to the eligibility criteria must meet the requirements of Article 14 of the Constitution and satisfy the test of non-arbitrariness.
- Placement in the select list does not confer an indefeasible right to appointment, as the State or its instrumentality may choose not to fill up vacancies for bona fide reasons.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations from the case include:
- The decision in K. Manjusree (supra) is considered good law and does not conflict with the decision in Subash Chander Marwaha (supra).
- Recruiting bodies have the flexibility to devise appropriate procedures for bringing the recruitment process to its logical end, as long as such procedures are transparent, non-discriminatory/non-arbitrary, and have a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved.
- Extant Rules with statutory force are binding on recruiting bodies both in terms of procedure and eligibility.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order 2012 was formulated under Section 11 of the Act. The policy aims to promote the growth and development of MSEs by mandating government departments and instrumentalities to procure at least 25% of goods and services from these enterprises. However, there are concerns regarding the implementation of this policy, particularly with regards to the imposition of minimum turnover clauses in tenders floated by government departments.

The petitioner, Mr. Giri, filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, seeking relief against the respondent authorities for not implementing the Procurement Order 2012 effectively. The petitioner's main grievance was that the MSEs were being unfairly disadvantaged due to unreasonable conditions in tenders floated by government departments.

The case involved several other stakeholders, including the National Board for MSMEs, the Advisory Committee, the Facilitation Council, the Review Committee, and the Grievance Cell.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's main argument was that the MSEs were being unfairly disadvantaged due to unreasonable conditions in tenders floated by government departments. The petitioner sought relief against the respondent authorities for not implementing the Procurement Order 2012 effectively.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that there was no mandatory minimum procurement 'right' for an individual MSE under the policy. However, they acknowledged that the authorities had a statutorily recognized obligation to implement the mandate of the policy, which was subject to judicial review.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court were as follows:

* The Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order 2012 has the force of law as it is formulated in exercise of power under Section 11 of the Act and also encapsulates the purpose and object of the Act.
* Though there is no mandatory minimum procurement 'right' for an individual MSE, there is certainly a statutorily recognized obligation on the authorities and the bodies under the Act and the Procurement Order 2012 to implement the mandate which is subject to judicial review.
* The judicial review will primarily ensure proper constitution and effective functioning of the authorities, including the National Board for MSMEs, the Advisory Committee, the Facilitation Council, the Review Committee, and the Grievance Cell, leaving the policy and decision-making to them.
* The respondents were directed to examine the issue of mandatory procurement of 25% of goods and services by the Government, and its instrumentalities from MSEs under clause 3 of the Policy in the context of clause 11 providing for reservation of specific items for procurement and take such action as is necessary for effective implementation of the Policy within a period of 60 days from the date of the order.
* The respondents were also directed to examine and declare limits of the minimum turnover clauses with respect to MSEs and issue appropriate policy guidelines within a period of 60 days from the date of the order.

The court observed that the purpose and object of entertaining this writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution is not so much to enquire into the individual grievance of the petitioner than to examine the nature of the rights created by the Procurement Order 2012 and the remedies available to the stakeholders, and to declare with clarity, certainty the scope of judicial review for effective implementation of the Policy.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment was as follows:

* The writ petition is disposed of directing that:
	+ The Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order 2012 has force of law as it is formulated in exercise of power under Section 11 of the Act and also encapsulates the purpose and object of the Act.
	+ Though there is no mandatory minimum procurement 'right' for an individual MSE, there is certainly a statutorily recognized obligation on the authorities and the bodies under the Act and the Procurement Order 2012 to implement the mandate which is subject to judicial review.
	+ The judicial review will primarily ensure proper constitution and effective functioning of the authorities, including the National Board for MSMEs, the Advisory Committee, the Facilitation Council, the Review Committee, and the Grievance Cell, leaving the policy and decision-making to them.
	+ The respondents are directed to examine the issue of mandatory procurement of 25% of goods and services by the Government, and its instrumentalities from MSEs under clause 3 of the Policy in the context of clause 11 providing for reservation of specific items for procurement and take such action as is necessary for effective implementation of the Policy within a period of 60 days from the date of the order.
	+ The respondents are also directed to examine and declare limits of the minimum turnover clauses with respect to MSEs and issue appropriate policy guidelines within a period of 60 days from the date of the order.

The court disposed of the writ petition without any order as to costs.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the recovery of gold bars from an individual, Nandkumar Babulal Soni. The gold bars were recovered in 2008 and were claimed to be stolen. Vijaya Bank, which had advanced a loan to Harmony Suisse, alleged that the gold bars were stolen from their vault.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the gold bars were stolen from the vault of Vijaya Bank and were sold to M/s Globe International through Harmony Suisse. The defense, however, contested this claim, arguing that the identification of the seized property as the stolen property was not established.
The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to establish its case, but failed to complete the chain of circumstances. The defense argued that the delay in recovery of the gold bars and the lack of evidence to connect them with Vijaya Bank's vault weakened the prosecution's case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Trial Court found that the identification of the seized property as the stolen property was not established due to the delay in recovery and the possibility of mistaken identification. The court observed that the weakness in the defense or the accused's failure to substantiate a fact could not become the strength of the prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals preferred by Nandkumar Babulal Soni, setting aside his conviction and sentence under Sections 120B and 411 of the IPC. The court directed that the seized gold bars be handed over to the appellant-Nandkumar Babulal Soni.
The court dismissed Criminal Appeal No. 584 of 2012 preferred by Vijaya Bank, holding that they were not entitled to possession of the seized gold as the identity of the seized property being the stolen property had not been established.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the trial of an appellant accused of causing the death of a girl named Marjina. The prosecution's case relies on circumstantial evidence, including statements from witnesses and the appellant's family members. The deceased's parents also testify that the appellant's mother and brother-in-law had told them that they would arrange for the marriage of their daughter to the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the appellant's guilt can be inferred from the circumstantial evidence presented, including the statements from witnesses and the deceased's parents. The defense, however, argues that the absence of motive is a significant factor in this case, as there is no evidence to suggest why the appellant would have caused the death of the girl.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that while direct evidence of eyewitness testimony is not available, the prosecution's narrative relies heavily on circumstantial evidence. The court also observes that the absence of motive is a factor that weighs in favor of the accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allows the criminal appeal and acquits the appellant of the charges against him. The court sets aside the judgments of the High Court and the Sessions Court, holding that the prosecution failed to prove each of the circumstances against the appellant.

The judgment is based on the principle that in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, motive plays an important link in completing the chain of circumstances. The absence of motive in this case weighs in favor of the accused, and the prosecution's failure to prove each of the circumstances against the appellant renders the conviction unjustified.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The writ petition was filed by retired employees seeking to assail the decision of the Supreme Court in Rajesh Chander Sood v. Union of India.
The petitioners were seeking reconsideration of the final decision of the Supreme Court after their review petition was dismissed.
The petitioners are senior citizens and retired employees, which may have been a consideration for not imposing costs on them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioners were that they should be allowed to file a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution to assail the decision of the Supreme Court in Rajesh Chander Sood v. Union of India.
However, the respondents (the State) argued that the law is well-settled that a decision rendered by the Supreme Court cannot be assailed directly or collaterally under Article 32 of the Constitution.
The respondents further argued that the remedy for an aggrieved litigant is to file for review, and if the grievance persists even after the review petition is dismissed, he may invoke the curative jurisdiction subject to compliance with the requirements of such jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the law is well-settled on this issue and that a decision rendered by the Supreme Court cannot be assailed directly or collaterally under Article 32 of the Constitution.
The Court also emphasized the importance of finality in judicial decisions, stating that litigation which had concluded or had reached finality cannot be reopened.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The writ petition was held to be "thoroughly misconceived" and was accordingly dismissed by the Court.
The Court further noted that the decision of the Supreme Court in Rajesh Chander Sood v. Union of India is clearly binding on the petitioners, and there is no merit in the writ petition.
No costs were imposed on the petitioners due to their age and status as retired employees.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS) appointed a new Chairperson, the third respondent, despite him not having the requisite experience. The appellant challenged this appointment, stating that it was made in violation of the rules.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the appointment of the third respondent as Chairperson was invalid due to his lack of experience and qualifications. They relied on a previous judgment (M. Tripura Sundari Devi) which held that making appointments in departure from either statutory requirements or public advertisement amounts to a fraud on the public.
The court also noted that the State (UoI) had exercised its power for a purpose foreign to that for which the power was intended, and therefore, the appointment suffered from "malice in law".
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the rules prescribing mandatory eligibility criteria must be applied strictly in public appointments under Article 16 of the Constitution.
The court noted that allowing a proven fraud to continue would go against reason and morality, and it is the duty of the Court to protect the rights of citizens.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were accepted by the court. The appointment of the third respondent was set aside, and he was directed to step down as Chairperson forthwith (within a week). A fresh process for appointment to the office of Chairperson was ordered to be initiated expeditiously.
The benefits received by the third respondent were not touched; however, no future benefit would enure to him on the basis of the service rendered as Chairperson beyond seven days from date.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, who was the Director of an Institute during the COVID-19 pandemic, reprimanded a subordinate (complainant) for indiscipline and negligence in her duties. The complainant filed a police complaint against the appellant under Sections 269, 270, and 504 of the IPC, alleging that the appellant's reprimand was an "intentional insult" meant to provoke her into committing a breach of peace or another offense.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellant's reprimand was an intentional insult meant to provoke the complainant, and that it was not a reasonable disciplinary measure. The prosecution also argued that the appellant's actions were intended to maintain discipline in the workplace, but that this did not justify using language that could be considered insulting or provocative.
The defense (appellant) argued that the reprimand was a necessary measure to maintain discipline in the Institute and that it was not an intentional insult. The defense also argued that the prosecution's interpretation of the appellant's actions would lead to gross misuse of liberty in workplaces, and that allowing criminal charges to be pressed against the Director could have disastrous consequences for maintaining a healthy disciplinary atmosphere.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the complainant had been receiving numerous complaints from parents about her negligence and lackadaisical approach towards duties. The court also noted that there were already pending complaints with respect to indiscipline in the Institute, and that the appellant was merely attempting to restore discipline by reprimanding the subordinate.
The court further observed that allowing criminal charges to be pressed against the Director could have disastrous consequences for maintaining a healthy disciplinary atmosphere in workplaces.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment dated 3rd May, 2024, was quashed and set aside by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that the necessary ingredients constituting the offenses applied in the chargesheet did not exist to allow further prosecution of the appellant. Consequently, the impugned chargesheet (CC No. 1771 of 2022) for offenses punishable under Sections 269, 270, and 504, IPC was quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant, a homebuyer, against the penalties imposed by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) for non-compliance with consumer protection laws. The homebuyers had invested their life savings in purchasing residential units but faced immense delays and financial hardship due to breaches of contractual obligations by the developers.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's argument is that the moratorium under Section 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) extends to regulatory penalties imposed for non-compliance with consumer protection laws. The appellant claims that this would allow homebuyers to stay regulatory penalties under the guise of insolvency proceedings, which would undermine the purpose of the Consumer Protection Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that there is a distinction between debt recovery proceedings and punitive actions. It also observes that penalties imposed by regulatory bodies in the public interest cannot be stayed merely because insolvency proceedings are ongoing. The court further recognizes that the legislative intent behind the IBC is to provide a mechanism for resolving financial distress, not to nullify obligations arising under regulatory statutes.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court finds no merit in the appellant's arguments and holds that the penalties imposed by the NCDRC are regulatory in nature and do not constitute "debt" under the IBC. The moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC does not extend to regulatory penalties imposed for non-compliance with consumer protection laws. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed, and the appellant is directed to comply with the penalties imposed by the NCDRC within a period of eight weeks from the date of this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over a property where the trial Court and the First Appellate Court had held that the suit was barred by limitation. The High Court remanded the matter to the trial Court for fresh trial solely with respect to the issue of limitation, but this decision was challenged in the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The parties argued over whether the question of limitation was properly framed as an issue and whether the failure to do so was fatal to the judgment. The respondents argued that they had knowingly slept on their right to challenge the sale and allowed further rights to flow, and therefore could not later question the sale.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that limitation is a matter of statute and must be strictly enforced, especially when the earlier transaction or sale is well within the knowledge of the parties. The court also noted that protecting bona fide purchasers for value is a significant consideration and that disturbing their rights after such a long period would create uncertainty in property transactions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, and restored the judgment and decree of the trial court dismissing the suit. The parties were ordered to bear their own costs throughout.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FINDINGS OF FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between an appellant and respondent no.2 regarding a bounced cheque of Rs. 35,00,000/-. The Trial Court found the respondent guilty and imposed a sentence of one year's simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 35,00,000/-. The Appellate Court upheld the conviction and sentence. The High Court overturned the concurrent findings of guilt and consequential conviction by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court.
</FINDINGS OF FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that he had a valid defence to the bounced cheque case, as he had sufficient funds in his account at the time the cheque was issued. The respondent no.2 argued that the appellant did not have sufficient funds in his account and hence, the cheque was dishonoured.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the Trial Court and the Appellate Court had already found the respondent guilty of bouncing a cheque for Rs. 35,00,000/-. The High Court noted that the respondent no.2 did not contest this fact in his appeal to the High Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order. It modified the sentence to only payment of a fine restricted to Rs. 32,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty-Two Lakhs). The Court ordered that the entire fine of Rs. 35,00,000/- will be payable to the appellant. The parties were left to bear their own costs.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves allegations of financial misconduct, misuse of position, and involvement in transactions constituting money laundering against the appellant. The respondent argues that the proceedings should not be quashed due to the magnitude of the allegations and the necessity of a thorough trial to establish the full extent of wrongdoing.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties are as follows:

* Appellant's arguments:
	+ The proceedings are unwarranted and should be discharged at the nascent stage of charge framing.
	+ The alleged acts do not constitute a continuing offence under the PMLA.
	+ The quantum of proceeds of crime involved does not meet the statutory threshold.
* Respondent's arguments:
	+ The allegations against the appellant are grave and serious, necessitating a thorough trial to unearth the complete chain of events and financial transactions.
	+ The PMLA was enacted to combat money laundering and curb the use of proceeds of crime in the formal economy.
	+ Judicial intervention at a preliminary stage must be exercised with caution, and proceedings should not be quashed in the absence of compelling legal grounds.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations are made:

* The court notes that cases involving economic offences necessitate a thorough trial to establish the full extent of wrongdoing.
* The PMLA serves as a crucial mechanism to ensure that individuals involved in laundering proceeds of crime are brought to justice and that economic offences do not go unpunished.
* Judicial scrutiny during trial is necessary to evaluate the evidence produced by the accused and find out the veracity of the severe allegations against them.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is as follows:

* The appeal is dismissed due to the lack of legally sustainable grounds warranting interference by the court at a pre-trial stage.
* The findings of the courts below are well-reasoned and do not call for interference.
* Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.

The Central Bank of India and another appellant (Appellants) challenged the order of the High Court, which allowed the respondents (Respondents) to proceed with their civil suits. The Appellants had argued that the Respondents' claims were barred by the limitation period. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in this case are:

*   The Appellants contended that the Respondents' claims were time-barred due to the limitation period.
*   The Respondents argued that their claims were not time-barred and should be allowed to proceed with their civil suits.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed the following:

*   The Appellants had sanctioned loans to the Respondents, but there was a dispute over the title search report prepared by the Officer who approved the loan.
*   The High Court had passed an order allowing the Respondents to proceed with their civil suits, and the Appellants challenged this order in the Supreme Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held:

*   That the limitation period was not a bar to the Respondents' claims, as they were entitled to proceed with their civil suits.
*   The High Court's order was upheld, and the Appellants' appeals were dismissed.
*   The Court also made observations regarding the need for standard guidelines for preparing title search reports and determining liability in such cases.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the execution of a decree for specific performance of a contract. The decree was passed in favor of the plaintiff, and it specified that the payment had to be made within two months from the date of the decree. However, the plaintiff failed to make the payment within the stipulated time or seek an extension of time.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the defendants (judgment debtors) argued that the decree became unexecutable due to the plaintiff's failure to make the payment within the stipulated time or seek an extension of time.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the plaintiff failed to comply with the conditions specified in the decree, which led to the decree becoming unexecutable. The court also noted that Section 28 of the Act permits the judgment debtor to seek rescission of a contract and also permits extension of time by the court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that merely because rescission of contract was not sought by the judgment debtors would not automatically result in extension of time. The court also stated that Section 28 of the Act is not applicable in this case as the decree did not specify a period for payment to be made by the plaintiff, but rather specified a period for execution.

<FACTS>
The case involves a respondent who was transferred to a prison in Jharkhand. The Inspector General of Prisons issued an order dated 17.05.2023, and the respondent's life and fundamental rights were protected. However, the High Court set aside this order on 21.08.2023.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the respondent's transfer to a prison in Jharkhand was challenged, and the issue of protecting their life and fundamental rights was raised.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations on the need for reforming prison administration and ensuring prisoners' rights are upheld. The Model Prison Manual 2016 was introduced as an attempt to standardize prison administration and ensure compliance with human rights standards.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The order of the High Court dated 21.08.2023 is set aside, and the order/memo dated 17.05.2023 of the Inspector General of Prisons is restored.

<FACTS>
The High Court passed an interim order in a second appeal without formulating substantial questions of law, granting relief to the parties involved.
All respondents in the second appeal were not served with notice, and Respondent Nos. 4, 6, and 7 were unserved.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned counsel for the respondent argued that the High Court has jurisdiction to pass interim orders ex parte and that the order impugned was an ad interim arrangement to protect the interests of the subject matter.
The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the High Court could not have passed the interim order without satisfying itself of the existence of a substantial question of law, as mandated under Section 100 CPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's jurisdiction to pass interim orders is limited by Section 100 CPC, which requires it to examine parties and formulate substantial questions of law before granting ad interim relief.
Departure from express provisions in the Code cannot be implied, and inherent jurisdiction cannot be exercised to nullify these provisions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the interim order passed by the High Court, holding that it was contrary to Section 100 CPC.
The appeal stands allowed, and there is no order as to costs.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

The accused's youngest child was found lying in a pool of blood, and the accused claimed it was a suicide. The wife and two daughters of the accused were sleeping in another room and woke up hearing the shouts of the accused. The accused admitted to owning the gun but explained that it was hidden by his children.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution relied on the following points:
- The complete absence of motive would weigh in favor of the accused, but it cannot be declared as a general proposition of universal application.
- The accused's claim of the child committing suicide is a deliberate falsehood.
- The presence of gunshot residue particles on the accused's right hand and around the wound suggests that the accused was involved in the crime.
- The ballistic expert's opinion could have been obtained, but it was not.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The prosecution observed:
- Motive is a crucial aspect of any crime, but its absence does not necessarily mean the accused is innocent.
- The presence of gunshot residue particles on the accused's hand and around the wound suggests that the accused was involved in the crime.
- The accused's false explanation about the gun being hidden by his children raises suspicions about his involvement in the crime.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court observed:
- Although motive is an essential aspect of a crime, its absence does not necessarily mean the accused is innocent.
- The presence of gunshot residue particles on the accused's hand and around the wound suggests that the accused was involved in the crime.
- The accused's false explanation about the gun being hidden by his children raises suspicions about his involvement in the crime.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involved a conviction under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which pertains to murder. The accused had fired at a fleeing party in a commercial locality, resulting in the death of a ten-year-old boy. The Sessions Court had acquitted the accused, but the acquittal was set aside by the High Court, and the accused was convicted under Section 302 read with Section 301 of the IPC.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the firing was not done in self-defense or to protect others, but rather as a commercial act to intimidate and frighten the complainant party. The defense argued that the accused had no intention to cause harm to the deceased and that the death was unintentional.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the firing was done in a crowded locality with numerous shops, and the accused had fired towards the fleeing persons without regard for their safety. The Court also noted that the accused's action was not justifiable under any circumstances and was tantamount to committing murder.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court ultimately upheld the conviction of the accused under Section 302 read with Section 301 of the IPC, observing that the doctrine of transfer of malice was applicable in this case.

* The High Court had presumed that there was an order of issuance of process, which was not available on record.
* The learned Magistrate did not apply his mind while issuing the process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the Accessible India Campaign and the implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The Petitioner has raised concerns about the lack of accessibility in various public buildings, transportation systems, and digital platforms.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Petitioner argued that:
- Rule 15 of the Accessibility Standards for Buildings and Facilities is not being properly implemented.
- There is a need to segregate non-negotiable rules from expansive guidelines.
- The existing legal framework requires reworking to ensure comprehensive inclusion across disabilities, universal design, assistive technology integration, and ongoing stakeholder consultation.

The Petitioner also pointed out that:
- NALSAR-CDS had prepared a report on accessibility standards for buildings and facilities, which was submitted to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.
- The report was prepared after consulting experts, receiving reports from states and union territories, and gathering individual testimonies.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that:
- Rule 15 is not being implemented properly, leading to non-compliance with accessibility standards.
- There is a need for baseline non-negotiable rules to be prescribed in Rule 15.
- Progressive compliance with existing standards and targets of the Accessible India Campaign must continue.

The Court also noted that NALSAR-CDS had prepared an extensive report on accessibility standards, which was appreciated by the Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court directed the Union Government to:
- Segregate non-negotiable rules from expansive guidelines in Rule 15.
- Conduct this exercise in consultation with stakeholders and NALSAR-CDS.
- Prescribe baseline non-negotiable rules in Rule 15.

The Court also directed the payment of INR 50,00,000 as compensation to NALSAR-CDS for their report, which was prepared over a period of six months after consulting experts, receiving reports from states and union territories, and gathering individual testimonies.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a decree of specific performance that was awarded to the appellant-plaintiff. The balance sale consideration of Rs. 4,87,000/- was deposited by the decree holder way back in 2019. However, there was a delay on the part of the decree holder in filing the execution petition and thereby seeking permission to deposit the balance sale consideration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented are based on the interpretation of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) and the concept of execution of decrees. The court emphasized that a decree of specific performance can be executed within 12 years from the date of the original decree or from the date the appellate court affirms such decree.

The court also discussed the importance of stipulating time periods for the deposit of balance sale consideration. If the appellate court fails to stipulate any particular time period, it is expected that the decree holder will deposit the same within a reasonable period of time.

Moreover, the court referred to Ramankutty Guptan (supra) and observed that the procedure should be moulded to subserve substantial justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The balance sale consideration deposited by the appellant-plaintiff way back on 20-05-2019 i.e. Rs. 4,87,000/- shall now be disbursed in favour of the defendants with interest accumulated thereon within a period of four weeks from today.
- Since there was a delay of 2 years in filing the execution petition and delay of 4 years in depositing the balance sale consideration of Rs. 4,87,000/-, the respondents-herein (judgment-debtors) are entitled to simple interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from the date of the judgment and order passed by the appellate court till the date the balance consideration was deposited i.e. 20.05.2019.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal succeeds, and hereby allowed. The impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside, and that of the executing court is affirmed.

The interest amount at the rate of 9 per cent simple interest shall be calculated by the executing court, and the appellant-herein shall deposit the said amount within a period of two weeks from today.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, where the appellant sought to set aside an award made by the arbitrator. The dispute arose out of a contract between the parties, which was governed by Indian law. The arbitrator had passed an award in favor of one party, and the other party had challenged it before the court.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the arbitrator had erred in interpreting the contract and had awarded compensation to the respondent without sufficient evidence. The appellant also claimed that the arbitrator had denied natural justice by not allowing them to present their case fully.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the jurisdiction of the court under Section 37 of the Act is akin to the jurisdiction under Section 34, and it cannot undertake an independent assessment of the merits of the award. The court also noted that the arbitrator had construed a term of the contract in a reasonable manner.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the appeal was without merit and dismissed it. The court stated that the scope of interference in an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act is restricted, and it cannot review the findings in an award if it has been substantially upheld. The court also observed that the arbitrator had decided the dispute in accordance with the terms of the contract.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the accused, Vihaan Kumar, against his arrest under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The accused was arrested without being informed of the grounds for his arrest.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case revolve around the requirement to inform the accused about the grounds for his arrest as mandated by Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India and Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The court discusses the importance of informing the arrested person of the reasons for their detention.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case highlight that communicating the grounds of arrest to the detained person is a constitutional mandate and is essential for enabling the person to know the reasons for their detention, thereby allowing them to take prompt action to secure their release as permissible under law. The court also notes that this requirement has been incorporated in the statute under Section 50 of the CrPC (Section 47 of BNSS).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court holds that the arrest without informing the accused about the grounds for his arrest is illegal and quashes the same. The court emphasizes the importance of adhering to the constitutional mandate of informing the arrested person about the reasons for their detention in writing, which also includes notifying friends, relatives, or other persons nominated by the detained individual.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a group of appellants who are challenging the decision of the Rajasthan High Court. The appellants had obtained certificates for OBC-NCL (Other Backward Classes Non-Creamy Layer) and MBC-NCL (Most Backward Classes Non-Creamy Layer) categories, but their validity was questioned by the authorities. The appellants claimed that they were eligible for these categories based on their caste certificates.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants relied on a 2-Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Ram Kumar Gijroya (supra) to support their claim. However, the court observed that the factual matrix of this case is distinct from the one in Ram Kumar Gijroya and hence, the ratio in the relied judgment does not apply.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that none of the appellants had a valid certificate and/or an affidavit as per the proforma at the relevant time. The court also observed that the reliance on the 2-Judge Bench decision is misplaced due to the distinct factual matrix.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the Civil Appeals, upholding the decision of the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court. The court held that the correct position of law is not in favor of the appellants and relying on the precedents and provisions of law governing the circumstances before us, the appeals are devoid of merit.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves HDFC Bank and two of its employees, Rakesh and Deepti. The bank had employed them in Mumbai, issued appointment letters from there, and made decisions regarding their employment and termination from the same location. Rakesh and Deepti subsequently instituted suits against HDFC Bank in Patna, claiming jurisdiction under the Indian Courts Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
HDFC Bank argued that the courts in Mumbai have exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes related to the employment of Rakesh and Deepti, as per the contract. The bank contended that the contract barred the jurisdiction of all other courts by using the word "exclusive". HDFC Bank relied on Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) and the explanation thereto.
Rakesh and Deepti, on the other hand, argued that they were employed in Patna and therefore the court there has jurisdiction to decide their disputes with HDFC Bank.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi observed that the contract between HDFC Bank and Rakesh/Deepti clearly stipulates that all disputes shall be decided by the courts in Mumbai. The Court noted that this clause is clear and unambiguous, making it evident that only the courts in Mumbai have jurisdiction to decide these disputes.
The Hon'ble High Court also observed that even if the courts in Patna were initially seized of the matter, they had no jurisdiction to entertain the suits filed by Rakesh and Deepti. The Court further noted that HDFC Bank's application under Order VII, Rule 11 of the CPC was justified as it challenged the maintainability of the plaint.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble High Court allowed the appeal of HDFC Bank and set aside the impugned judgment of the Delhi High Court. The Court directed that the suits instituted by Rakesh and Deepti in Patna be returned to them for presentation before the competent court in Mumbai.
The Court granted liberty to Rakesh and Deepti to amend their respective plaints, if necessary, or institute fresh suits in a competent court in Mumbai.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an arbitral award dated 03.06.2005, which was challenged by the Division Bench of the High Court. The court had to examine whether the arbitrator's interpretation of Clause 51 was reasonable and in accordance with the evidence on record.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the Division Bench of the High Court argued that the arbitral award was opposed to the public policy of India, contained patent illegality, and shocked the conscience of the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the arbitrator had interpreted Clause 51 in a reasonable manner based on the evidence on record. The learned Single Judge exercising jurisdiction under Section 34 of the 1996 Act had also affirmed this interpretation. Therefore, the Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in setting aside the arbitral award.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the judgment and order dated 17.11.2009 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and restored the arbitral award dated 03.06.2005. Consequently, the appeal was allowed. However, there shall be no order as to cost.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal proceeding against the Appellants arising out of FIR RC No.13(E)/2008-CBI, BS & FC, Mumbai. The allegations were made against the Bank Manager and others for their involvement in commissioning offences related to bank fraud. However, the settlement was initiated prior to the filing of the chargesheet, and the finalization of the settlement took place before the chargesheet was filed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the criminal case against them had an overwhelming and pre-dominant civil character arising out of a pure commercial transaction where the parties had resolved their entire dispute amongst themselves. They also contended that the allegations against the Bank Manager relating to his involvement in the commission of offences have not been substantiated, making the possibility of conviction remote and bleak.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the stage and timing of the settlement play a crucial role in determining whether to exercise power under Section 482 of the CrPC 1973 or not. The Court also noted that cases where settlement has arrived at either immediately or in close vicinity after the alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under investigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal proceeding/investigation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court accepted the prayer made by the Appellants to hold that the High Court should have exercised its powers and jurisdiction under Section 482 to quash the proceedings. The impugned order dated 05.05.2017 passed by the High Court was hereby quashed and set aside, and as a consequence thereof, the criminal proceedings against the Appellants arising out of FIR RC No.13(E)/2008-CBI, BS & FC, Mumbai were quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a contempt of court proceeding against the appellants for violating an order of the Court regarding the alienation of property. The appellants were ordered to not sell or transfer the property, but they failed to comply with this order. The High Court found them guilty of contempt and imposed a penalty.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they had obtained prior permission from the Court to re-emphasize the undertaking and make it into an order, which was later extended by the Court. They claimed that they were not willfully disobeying the order but rather following the Court's instructions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the appellants had failed to take any steps to discharge the order despite having the opportunity to do so. The Court noted that the powers of contempt are exercised sparingly and with caution, but in this case, the violation was clear and the penalty was necessary to uphold the dignity of the law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court confirmed the judgment of the High Court, finding the appellants guilty of contempt. However, considering their age (approximately 68 years at the time of the appeal), the Court modified the order by deleting the three months' confinement in civil prison. The attachment of property and compensation were left intact. The amount of compensation was enhanced from Rs.10 lakhs to Rs.13 lakhs, with simple interest @6% from the date of the lower Court's judgment (2nd August 2013).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 respectively purchased the suit property during the pendency of the suit instituted for specific performance while an injunction against the original owner (transferor) was operating.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The case revolves around the impleadment of a transferee pendente lite, who is not entitled to come on record as a matter of right. The Court has to exercise its discretion in each case to decide whether to grant leave to appeal or not. 
A lis pendens transferee can seek leave to appeal against the final decree passed against this transferor, but the discretion of the court should be exercised judiciously.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations were made by the Court:
i. For the purpose of impleading a transferee pendente lite, the facts and circumstances should be gone into, and basing on the necessary facts, the Court can permit such a party to come on record.
ii. A transferee pendente lite is not entitled to come on record as a matter of right.
iii. The impleadment of a transferee pendente lite would depend upon the nature of the suit and appreciation of the material available on record.
iv. Where a transferee pendente lite does not ask for leave to come on record, that would obviously be at his peril, and the suit may be improperly conducted by the plaintiff on record.
v. The sale transaction pendente lite is hit by the provisions of Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act.
vi. A transferee pendente lite, being an assignee of interest in the property, as envisaged under Order XXII Rule 10 CPC, can seek leave of the Court to come on record on his own or at the instance of either party to the suit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The impugned order passed by the High Court is unsustainable in law. The appeals succeed and are hereby allowed. The impugned order is set aside. It is open for Respondent Nos. 1 & 2 to avail appropriate legal remedy before the appropriate forum in accordance with law for the purpose of recovery of the amount towards sale consideration paid at the time of execution of the sale deed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The deceased had sent a suicide note to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for examination. The handwriting on the suicide note was matched with the handwriting of the deceased, and it was found to be similar. However, the prosecution did not examine the Deputy Chief Handwriting Expert as an expert witness.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellants had extorted money from the deceased by threatening him and his family, and that the suicide note was a genuine expression of the deceased's despair due to the blackmailing. The defence argued that there was no evidence to prove that the appellants had committed any act of incitement or blackmailing proximate to the date of the alleged incident.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that expert's evidence as to handwriting is opinion evidence and can rarely, if ever, take the place of substantive evidence. The court also noted that the prosecution had not examined the Deputy Chief Handwriting Expert as an expert witness despite the report of the handwriting expert being sent to the FSL.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 17.12.2013 and of the trial court dated 12.05.2011. The court held that there was no sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt, and that the prosecution had failed to establish any act of incitement or blackmailing by the appellants proximate to the date of the alleged incident.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Respondent moved the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate for action against the named public servant under section 4 of the Act of 1989 on 05.06.2018.
No administrative enquiry report was called for by the Magistrate before taking cognizance of the offence.
The Metropolitan Magistrate dismissed C.T. No. 536/2018, stating that no case warranting penal proceedings under section 4 had been made out.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the Magistrate should have called for an administrative enquiry report before taking cognizance of the offence.
The Respondent contended that the Magistrate had correctly applied his discretion and concluded that no offence was made out in the complaint.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the direction in the impugned judgment for penal prosecution against the public servants was not in conformity with the mandate of law.
The Metropolitan Magistrate's decision to dismiss C.T. No. 536/2018 was found to be correct and unassailable in the circumstances of the case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court held that the jurisdiction for infraction of sub-section (2) of section 4 is attracted only on the recommendation of the administrative enquiry, and then cognizance under sub-section (3) of section 4 can be ordered.
The court further observed that the purpose of an administrative enquiry is to find out the conduct of a public servant against whom allegations of failure of duty or function are made.
Ultimately, the impugned judgment was set aside, and the Criminal Appeal was allowed. 
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a husband and his mother-in-law who are accused of murdering the wife. The incident occurred inside their house, and the prosecution alleged that both the husband and his mother-in-law were involved in the crime. However, the key issue is whether the husband shared common intention with his mother-in-law to commit the murder.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. It can be inferred that the prosecution argued for the involvement of both the husband and his mother-in-law in the crime, while the defense may have argued against their liability.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) deals with vicarious liability and requires a pre-arranged plan and prior concert between the accused. The court noted that when common intention is proved but no overt act is attributed to the individual accused, Section 34 can be invoked. However, if participation of the accused in the crime is proved and common intention is absent, Section 34 cannot be applied.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the mother-in-law was guilty of the alleged crime, but committed an error in holding the husband guilty with the aid of Section 34 IPC. The court allowed the appeal of the husband and acquitted him of all charges. The judgment also directed the release of the husband from jail, if not required in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal petition filed by the appellants (Geddams Jhansi and Sathyakama Jabali) against the continuance of criminal proceedings against them in two separate cases. The marriage between the complainant and one of the principal accused took place in Pondicherry, and they lived with the mother-in-law in Chennai. However, the appellants reside in Hyderabad and do not live together with the complainant and her husband.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants' counsel were:
* The materials on record did not constitute a prima facie case against the appellants for continuing the criminal proceedings against them.
* The allegations made against the appellants were general and sweeping, without specific details.
* As the appellants do not live with the principal accused, they cannot be held liable for alleged offenses committed in the matrimonial house of the complainant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that:
* The evidence of the complainant was the foundation for the criminal proceedings against the appellants, but it did not disclose anything new as far as the appellants were concerned.
* The other witnesses' evidence did not add any new information regarding the allegations made against the appellants.
* Allowing the criminal proceedings to continue against the appellants would amount to an abuse of the process of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed both the present Criminal Appeals and:
* Set aside the impugned judgment and order dated 04.04.2022 passed by the Ld. Single Bench of the High Court for the State of Telangana in Criminal Petition No. 3105 of 2022.
* Quashed the criminal proceedings in "C.C. No. 46 of 2022" pending before the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Bhongir under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, qua the two appellants, Geddam Jhansi and Geddam Sathyakama Jabali.
* Set aside the impugned judgment and order dated 03.02.2022 passed by the Ld. Single Bench of the High Court for the State of Telangana in Criminal Petition No. 1002 of 2022.
* Quashed the criminal proceedings in DVC No. 25 of 2021 pending before the Court of the Additional Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Bhongir qua the appellant, Geddam Jhansi.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a person who was discharged by the Sessions Court, and later an order of stay on the discharge was passed by the High Court. The person was required to appear before the next appellate court under Section 437A of the CrPC.
The bail bonds furnished by the person in terms of the order dated 20th October 2023 were for ensuring his presence when notice of the proceedings against an order of discharge is served. However, the validity of these bail bonds may have expired.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the ex-parte order of stay on the discharge was illegal and should be set aside. The respondent-NCT of Delhi and the fifth respondent argued for the quashing of the impugned orders.
It appears that there is a general argument for the court to decide the revision application without being influenced by any observations made in this judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the ex-parte order of stay on the discharge was illegal and had drastic consequences. The court also noted that the bail bonds furnished by the person may have expired, necessitating a new set of bail conditions to be imposed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals and passed the following orders:

a. Quashed and set aside the impugned orders dated 21st October 2023 and 4th November 2024.
b. Directed the High Court to decide the revision application without being influenced by any observations made in this judgment.
c. Required the person to appear before the Sessions Court within four weeks from today and furnish bail effective till disposal of the revision application on such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Sessions Court.
d. Imposed usual conditions while admitting the person to bail, including a condition of cooperating with the High Court for early disposal of the revision application.

The appeals were allowed on the above terms.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Rule 21(8) of the Punjab VAT Rules and its applicability to input tax credit on stock in trade. The State had lowered the rate of tax on iron and steel goods with effect from 01.02.2014, but there was no corresponding provision in the parent statute (Punjab VAT Act) that permitted availing of input tax credit at the lower rate of tax on existing stock in trade.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The State argued that Rule 21(8) should be applied retrospectively to the existing stock in trade, reducing the quantum of input tax credit. The High Court, however, held that prior to 01.04.2014, there was no statutory sanction to allow applicability of Rule 21(8) on the stock in trade.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The benefit of input tax credit is traceable to the statute and must have the requisite statutory sanction if it is to be reduced.
- Reversing input tax credit at the lower rate of tax would lead to a natural corollary, which would result in revenue loss for the State exchequer.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the interpretation given by the High Court to the applicability of Rule 21(8) of the Punjab VAT Rules read with the amended first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Punjab VAT Act is legally sound and warrants no interference. Consequently, the appeals were dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the complainant against the appellants, alleging various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 323, 504, 506, 509, and 511. The FIR was lodged on December 23, 2012, after an initial complaint was filed on November 25, 2012. The chargesheet alleged the use of "filthy language" by the appellants in scolding the complainant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants included that the criminal proceedings were initiated with mala fide intentions to wreak vengeance, cause harm, or coerce a settlement. They also argued that there was no cognizable offence committed against the complainant and that the FIR was registered after 58 days of the initial complaint.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court included discrepancies and variations in the complaints and chargesheet, suggesting a deliberate attempt to reclassify the nature of the proceedings from non-cognizable to cognizable or to transform a civil dispute into a criminal matter. The court also noted that allowing the criminal proceedings to proceed against the appellants would amount to an abuse of the legal process and result in a travesty of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court was that the impugned order passed by the High Court dated July 31, 2019, cannot be sustained and stands set aside. The chargesheet and the entire proceedings in Case Crime No. 53073 of 2014 against the appellants stand quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and private bus operators who challenged the delegation of power by the State Transport Authority (STA) to its Secretary for granting non-stage carriage permits, including contract carriage, special, tourist, and temporary permits. The STA had delegated this power under Section 68(5) of the Motor Vehicles Act (MV Act) and Rule 56(1)(d) of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent corporation (KSRTC) argued that the delegation of power to the Secretary was unconstitutional and went against the legislative intent. They contended that permit-granting power is a core function of the STA and cannot be delegated. The private bus operators also raised similar concerns, arguing that such delegation would lead to inefficiencies in the permit-issuance process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the legislative intent was to liberalize the regime for non-stage carriage permits and improve public transport service delivery. It observed that allowing delegation would facilitate prompt and efficient processing of permit applications without undermining the oversight function of the STA.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the power of the STA to delegate the issuance of contract carriage, special, tourist, and temporary permits to its Secretary is fully supported by the statutory provisions of Section 68(5) of the MV Act and Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules. It concluded that such delegation is a rational and necessary administrative measure to facilitate prompt and efficient processing of permit applications without undermining the oversight function of the STA. The court rejected the respondent's arguments and held that the High Court's reasoning on non-delegability was flawed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the respondent against several appellants who published news articles that allegedly harmed their reputation. The auction was conducted on 27.06.2014, and the complaint was filed on 22.08.2014.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
- The Magistrate's order suffered from procedural irregularity in not following the mandatory procedure under section 202 Cr.P.C.
- The complainant failed to produce any witness to prima facie establish that the alleged imputations had lowered their reputation in the estimation of others.
- There was no intent to defame or harm the complainant's reputation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed:
- The power of the media in shaping public opinion is significant, and those working in the media must exercise utmost caution and responsibility before publishing any statements, news, or opinions.
- Accuracy and fairness in media reporting are critical when dealing with matters having the potential to impact the integrity of individuals or institutions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed all these appeals and quashed:
- The impugned order passed by the High Court
- Summoning orders as well as the criminal complaint filed by the respondent, as far as the appellants herein are concerned.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an investigation and trial of two accused individuals, the first accused being a Minister for State and the second accused being a public servant. The allegations against them include misuse of authority, corruption, and demand/acceptance of bribes. The investigation report suggests that the Minister had sanctioned the grant of fishing rights on an upset price, deviating from the policy requiring a tender process. However, no evidence is found to prove demand or acceptance of bribe by the second accused.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant (second accused) argues that there is not even an iota of material available from the investigation report, pre-charge statements, or statements of persons questioned by the investigation team to attract the ingredients of the provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The defense further states that the accusation against them is only with respect to misuse of authority, which does not come under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the investigation report speaks only of an allegation of misuse of authority without any allegation of demand and acceptance of bribe as against the appellant (second accused). The court also notes that there is no material to prove that the second accused demanded or accepted a bribe.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeal and directs that the proceedings initiated against the second accused be dropped. The court observes that the discharge application of the appellant (second accused) ought to have been allowed by the Special Court, especially since there is not even an allegation of demand and acceptance of bribe.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the sentence imposed by the High Court on two appellants, Sita Ram and Onkar Singh. The appellants were convicted of a crime and sentenced to undergo RI (Rajpati) with fines.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Ms. Sangita Kumar made submissions for the appellants, arguing that the sentence imposed by the High Court was too harsh and that there were mitigating circumstances that should be considered. The submissions focused on Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, which deals with the admissibility of dying declarations.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations from the court include:
* The expectation of imminent death is not a requirement for a statement to be considered a dying declaration under Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act.
* The words "as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death" appearing in Section 32 must have some proximate relation to the actual occurrence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the decision of the High Court but reduced the sentence imposed on both appellants. 
* The sentence for Sita Ram was reduced from 6 years RI to 1 year RI, with a fine of Rs.5000/- that still needs to be deposited.
* Onkar Singh's sentence was reduced to the period already undergone (no specific time given), and he still needed to pay the fine of Rs.10000/-. If not paid, he would have to undergo an additional 6 months of RI.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves capital punishment and the accused are appealing against their conviction. The trial was concluded within a period of less than two months from the date of registration of the case, which is reflective of undue haste.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they were not provided with a fair opportunity to defend themselves during the trial. They claimed that the scientific experts associated with the preparation and issuance of the DNA report were not summoned or examined as court witnesses, which led to the failure of justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that providing a fair opportunity to the accused to defend himself is absolutely imperative and non-negotiable in cases involving capital punishment. The trial court was criticized for its undue haste in concluding the trial within a short period, which led to the failure of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by the appellants and remanded the case to the trial court. The scientific experts associated with the preparation and issuance of the DNA report were ordered to be summoned and examined as court witnesses with a proper opportunity of examination to both the prosecution and defense. A defense counsel was also appointed to represent the accused in the de novo trial, which was directed to be completed within four months from the date of receipt of the order.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a Review Petition in the matter of Civil Appeal No. 6990 of 2014, where the court is considering the decision made by the High Court on the doctrine of stare decisis and its application to more than 100 judgments rendered by various Benches of the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are centered around the application of the doctrine of stare decisis, with the Full Bench of the High Court holding that a consistent view has been taken in more than 100 judgments and applying the doctrine to uphold this view. However, the Review Petition raises questions about the correctness of this decision.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the Review Petition raises errors apparent on the face of the record, including:
- The non-consideration of the reasoning given by the Full Bench of the High Court in Jai Singh II regarding the applicability of the doctrine of stare decisis.
- The failure to show how the findings in Gurjant Singh and other cases are erroneous in law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment allows the Review Petition, recalls the earlier decision, and restores the appeal to file for further hearing. The court also directs that the appeal be listed for peremptory hearing on 7th August 2024 at Serial No.1.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of an appellant-convict for murdering Master Bhuvanraj and Miss Krithika. The convict had a troubled relationship with his sister-in-law, Ms. Savitha, who fell in love with her colleague, Mr. P. Mohan (PW-19), a man from a different caste. The convict demanded that she break off the relationship, which led to tension between them. Eventually, the convict killed Ms. Savitha and her mother, as well as Master Bhuvanraj and Miss Krithika, for no apparent reason.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court focused on the mitigating circumstances of the case, including:
- The appellant-convict had no criminal antecedents
- Good relations with the deceased persons
- Not all mitigating circumstances were considered by the Trial Court

These factors led the court to consider a modification of the sentence from death to life imprisonment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The barbarity of the crime and the helplessness of the two children who met their ends at the hands of their own father
- The unjustified high-handedness of the convict in demanding that his sister-in-law break off her relationship with Mr. P. Mohan
- The importance of considering all factors in favour of the accused before imposing a sentence of death
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court states:
"The appeals are, therefore, partly allowed to the extent of the sentence modification. In the result, the appellant-convict's conviction for the murders of Master Bhuvanraj, and Miss Krithika, is maintained, but he shall now await his natural end, without remission, in the confines of a penitentiary."

* The High Court erred in setting aside the arbitration award dated 10.03.2012, and consequently, the order passed on the application filed under Section 34 of the Act.
* The reasons assigned for setting aside the arbitration award were not in accordance with law.
* The appellant is entitled to the sum of Rs.47.75 crores, being the initial deposit, and Rs.46,20,715/- being the actual expenses incurred, along with interest at a modified rate of 8% per annum.

The respondent's arguments are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Supreme Court include:
* Time was of the essence in this project, and each day’s delay in executing the project after signing of the Development Agreement had commercial consequences and struck at the heart of the Development Agreement.
* The issues involved between the parties cannot be termed trivial, as the delay here extended to more than 16 months.
* The Arbitral Tribunal's Award dated 10.03.2012 is modified, and the order passed under Section 34 of the Act also stands modified mutatis mutandis.
</OBSERVATIONS>

- The power to impose modified punishment can only be exercised by the High Court and the Supreme Court.
- The Appellant has been given an opportunity to test the verdict through further appeals.
- The commutation of death sentence is necessary due to the lack of aggravating circumstances in the case.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction of a husband accused of murdering his wife. The prosecution alleged that the murder took place within the four walls of their residential house. The key facts include:
* The dead body of the deceased was recovered from the house itself.
* The husband, the accused, failed to provide a plausible explanation for what happened to his wife on the date of the incident.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties include:
* Prosecution: 
  * Motive is not enough to convict the accused; it must be considered along with other incriminating circumstances.
  * The discovery of the dead body within the house and the failure of the accused to provide a plausible explanation justify his conviction.
* Defence:
  * The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, relying on circumstantial evidence.
  * Section 106 of the Evidence Act cannot be invoked without first laying foundational facts, which the prosecution did not do in this case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The court made several observations regarding the prosecution's case:
* The prosecution relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and failed to establish a direct link between the accused and the crime.
* The fact that the dead body was recovered from within the house is not sufficient to prove the accused's guilt, as it could be a result of various other factors.
* The failure of the accused to provide a plausible explanation for his wife's death does not necessarily imply his guilt, especially when considering Section 106 of the Evidence Act.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction of the husband. The judgment held that:
* The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, relying on circumstantial evidence and not laying foundational facts for invoking Section 106 of the Evidence Act.
* The fact that the accused did not provide a plausible explanation for his wife's death is not sufficient grounds for conviction in itself.
* Motive cannot be the sole basis for convicting an accused, especially in serious offenses like murder.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around a property dispute, and the plaintiff's claim is based on an agreement to sell dated 29.03.1999. The defendant no.1 allegedly received Rs.10,000/- from the plaintiff, which has been with him for almost 25 years. The appellants have purchased the property from defendant no.1.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The plaintiff's claim is based on an agreement to sell that was insufficiently stamped, and thus, inadmissible as evidence. The High Court treated this document as admissible without resolving the stamp duty deficiency, which is against the statutory mandate under the Stamp Act. 
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Trial Court correctly held that the agreement to sell dated 29.03.1999 was not admissible as evidence due to insufficient stamping. The High Court's decision to treat this document as admissible without resolving the stamp duty deficiency is contrary to the statutory requirements.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned order of the High Court, and restored the order of the Trial Court dismissing the suit. The appellants are directed to return Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakhs only) to the plaintiff within three months from today.

The case revolves around the issue of service tax on the promotion and marketing of lottery tickets sold by the State. The appellants, who are engaged in the business of selling lottery tickets to stockists and others, challenged the imposition of service tax by the State. The case involved multiple High Courts and ultimately reached the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the appellants was that the sale of lottery tickets by the State is a privileged activity and not a service for which promotion or marketing services are required. They also pointed out that the definition of 'goods' in clause (50) of Section 65 of the Act excludes actionable claims, which includes lottery tickets. The appellants further argued that even if the Explanation to sub-clause (ii) of Clause 19 of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, is considered, it cannot override the main provision which defines business auxiliary service.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Courts had lost sight of the definition of 'goods' in clause (50) of Section 65 of the Act while interpreting the expression "lottery". The Supreme Court observed that the States are not rendering a service but engaged in the activity of conducting lottery to earn additional revenue.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by the appellants and set aside the impugned judgments of the High Courts of Sikkim and Kerala. The court held that the sale of lottery tickets by the State is a privileged activity and not rendering of a service for which promotion or marketing services are required. The court also observed that even if the Explanation to sub-clause (ii) of Clause 19 of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994, is considered, it cannot override the main provision which defines business auxiliary service.

The parties involved are in dispute over the Shareholders Agreement dated 25.07.2011. The petitioner claims entitlement to 4,00,000 and 2,00,010 equity shares in respondent no.1 company.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:

* Existence of arbitration agreement: Both parties agree on the existence of an arbitration agreement as contained in Clause 13.10 of the Shareholders Agreement.
* Claim of petitioner being ex-facie time barred: The submissions regarding this issue may be adjudicated upon by the arbitral tribunal as a preliminary issue.
* Merits of the dispute: All other submissions made by the parties are concerned with the merits of the dispute, which falls within the domain of the arbitral tribunal.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:

* Limited scope of judicial interference: The referral courts need only examine whether the arbitration agreement exists – nothing more, nothing less.
* Balance between limited scope and interests of parties: To balance the limited scope of judicial interference with the interests of the parties who might be constrained to participate in the arbitration proceedings, the arbitral tribunal may direct that the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the party which the Tribunal ultimately finds to have abused the process of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:

* The present petitions are allowed. An arbitral tribunal comprising of the same sole arbitrator, Mr. Mayur Khandeparkar (Advocate, High Court of Judicature at Bombay), who has already been constituted for the adjudication of disputes between the same parties in relation to the Service Agreement dated 18.10.2011, is directed to be constituted for the present disputes pertaining to the Shareholders Agreement dated 25.07.2011.
* The fees of the arbitrator including other modalities shall be fixed in consultation with the parties.
* In the event the arbitral tribunal ultimately finds the present claims of the petitioner to be time-barred, it may direct that the costs of the arbitration pertaining to these claims be borne solely by the petitioner herein.

The petitioner, Salam Samarjeet Singh, challenged the recruitment process of the High Court of Manipur. The petitioner had scored 50.6% in aggregate marks in the recruitment tests and was supposed to be appointed as a judicial officer.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's argument was that he was entitled to appointment as a judicial officer based on his performance in the recruitment tests, which were conducted according to the then-existing rules. The petitioner also argued that denying him appointment would be unjustified and would disturb the seniority of those who are already serving in the same cadre.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the recruitment process was conducted according to the then-existing rules, and the petitioner had scored 50.6% in aggregate marks, which was sufficient for appointment as a judicial officer. The court also noted that denying the petitioner's appointment would be unjustified.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is entitled to appointment as a judicial officer by virtue of his scoring 50.6% in aggregate marks in the recruitment tests. However, the appointed petitioner will not be entitled to seniority prior to his appointment. The court directed the High Court of Manipur to issue an appointment order to the petitioner and grant him notional seniority from the year 2015 for the purpose of superannuation benefits.

The case discusses the grant of bail and the consideration of victim compensation. The facts mentioned include:
- A batch of petitions related to various offenses, including dowry, Section 420 IPC, Section 376 IPC, and POCSO Act.
- The common aspect is that a particular learned Judge of the High Court granted bail on condition of depositing substantive sums of money without considering the requirements of bail dependent on the nature of offenses.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented include:
- The willingness of the accused to pay compensation cannot be a reason for grant of anticipatory bail.
- Bail cannot per se be granted if a person can afford to deposit money or his capacity to pay.
- There is no proper consideration of the requirements of bail dependent on the nature of offenses.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made include:
- The High Court's direction to deposit an interim compensation as a condition for grant of anticipatory bail was deprecated by the Supreme Court.
- The willingness of the accused to pay compensation cannot be a ground for grant of anticipatory bail.
- The jurisdiction of this Court is not to analyze what weighed with the learned Judge while granting bail, but rather to consider if there has been a proper consideration of the requirements of bail dependent on the nature of offenses.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment made includes:
- In view of the judgment in Dharmesh v. State of Gujarat (2021) 7 SCC 198, there is no question of victim compensation at the stage of grant of bail.
- The common thread running through these cases is that one particular learned Judge of the High Court has granted bail on condition of depositing substantive sums of money without considering the requirements of bail dependent on the nature of offenses.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a criminal prosecution instituted against the accused appellants, who are involved in a dispute with the complainant over allegations of fraud and breach of trust. The complainant filed a FIR on March 6th, 2011, alleging that the accused abused him using profane language and intimidated him. However, it was discovered that no complaint was ever filed on July 29th, 2010, as alleged by the complainant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that the prosecution is based on frivolous allegations and an abuse of the process of law. They contended that the allegations do not constitute an actionable civil wrong and that allowing the prosecution would be an abuse of the process of law, especially in light of Section 4 of the Benami Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the complainant has tried to misuse the tool of criminal law by filing a frivolous FIR. The court also noted that there is no material to support the allegations of abuse and intimidation made by the complainant against the accused appellants.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by the accused appellants, quashing the impugned order and setting aside the criminal case. The court held that allowing the prosecution would be an abuse of the process of law, especially in light of Section 4 of the Benami Act.

The case revolves around the applicability of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to professional services provided by lawyers. The facts indicate that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) had held that a complaint could be filed under the Consumer Protection Act for deficiency in service rendered by lawyers.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
*   The applicability of the Consumer Protection Act to professional services provided by lawyers
*   The need to exclude professional services, especially those of lawyers, from the purview of the Consumer Protection Act
*   The international practices followed by other countries in excluding professional services from consumer protection laws
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
*   The importance of having a uniform application of laws, particularly those framed on the basis of common resolutions like the UNO
*   The need to exclude professional services, especially those of lawyers, from consumer protection laws to maintain the integrity and finality of the justice delivery system
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is as follows:
*   The Supreme Court has set aside the impugned order of the NCDRC dated 06.08.2007.
*   It was held that the legislature did not intend to include professional services, especially those of lawyers, within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and re-enacted in 2019.
*   The view taken by the NCDRC to the effect that a complaint could be filed under the Consumer Protection Act for deficiency in service rendered by lawyers is incorrect and stands overruled.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Income-tax Act, 1961, and the rules related to fringe benefits for bank employees. The issue at hand is whether Rule 3(7)(i) of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, which benchmarks the computation of fringe benefit with reference to the State Bank of India's (SBI) Prime Lending Rate (PLR), is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The rule-making authority has posited SBI's rate of interest as the benchmark for determining the value of benefit to the assessee in comparison to the rate of interest charged by other individual banks. The fixation of SBI's rate of interest as the benchmark is neither an arbitrary nor unequal exercise of power, as it treats the benefit enjoyed by bank employees from interest-free loans or loans at a concessional rate as a unique advantage that needs taxation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations regarding the rule:
- The rule prevents ascertainment of the interest rates being charged by different banks from their customers and checks unnecessary litigation.
- It ensures consistency in application, provides clarity for both the assessee and the revenue department, and provides certainty as to the amount to be taxed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that Rule 3(7)(i) is intra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court upholds the impugned judgments of the High Courts of Madras and Madhya Pradesh, dismissing the appeals without any order as to costs.

The case involves a dispute over the custody of two minor children. The Appellant (father) was granted custody by the Family Court, but the Respondent (mother) appealed to the High Court.
The alleged incident that led to the appeal occurred on 08.08.2015.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant's argument is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it can be inferred as a defense against the allegations of parental alienation.
The Respondent (mother) allegedly claimed that the Appellant had engaged in "alienating behavior" and that the minor children showed preference for her over their father.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Learned Single Judge of the High Court interacted with the minor children on 24.02.2020, nearly 4.5 years after the alleged incident, and recorded that they expressed no overt preference amongst their parents.
The Family Court had previously recorded that there was nothing on record to suggest that the interests and welfare of the minor children were in any manner affected during their stay with the Appellant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the Impugned Order, and retained the custody of the minor children with the Appellant, subject to the visitation rights of the Respondent as granted by the Family Court.
The court held that there was no evidence of "alienating behavior" on the part of the Appellant and that the High Court erred in law and fact while relying on a previous decision (Vivek Singh).

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the First Appellate Court's decision to set aside the Judgment and decree of the trial court without meeting the findings of the trial court. The High Court has intervened, setting aside the Judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court to restore the Judgment and decree of the trial court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case seem to be based on precedents and legal principles as stated in previous judgments (Jagannath v. Arulappa & Anr., H.K.N. Swami v. Irshad Basith (Dead) By Lrs.) that the First Appellate Court should address all issues, determine the appeal upon assignment of cogent reasons, and not set aside findings without reason.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case highlight the importance of the perceptive functions of the trial Judge, where errors of inference do not play a significant role. The appellate court is required to give cogent reasons when reversing findings of fact, as stated in Jagannath v. Arulappa & Anr.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the First Appellate Court wrongly set aside the Judgment, decree, and findings of the trial court without meeting the findings of the trial court. The High Court has rightly set aside the Judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court to restore the Judgment and decree of the trial court.

The plaintiff entered into an agreement with only one of the co-owners and sought extensions for execution of the sale deed. The plaintiff was aware of the sale deed dated 14.05.1997 executed in favour of defendant nos. 12 to 14 and sent a legal notice on 30.05.1997. The plaintiff objected to the subsequent purchasers' application for mutation of their names in the revenue records on 20.08.1997. A meeting of the Gram Panchayat was held on 06.12.1997, yet the suit was preferred on 09.05.2000, which is on the last date of limitation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are based on previous judgments and their application to the current situation. The court considers the delay in filing the suit as a crucial factor in determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance. The court cites cases such as K.S. Vidyanadam, Azhar Sultana, Saradamani Kandappan, and Atma Ram to support its argument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are based on previous judgments and their application to the current situation. The court notes that every suit for specific performance does not need to be decreed merely because it is filed within the period of limitation. The court also observes that the fact that limitation is three years does not mean that a purchaser can wait for one or two years to file a suit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the High Court is upheld, and the appeal lacks substance. The parties are ordered to bear their own costs. The court dismisses the appeal, considering the delay in filing the suit as a crucial factor in determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance.

The incident of gangrape took place on 8th July 1989. The accused were acquitted in 1992 for the offences alleged under Section 376 of the IPC. However, sixteen years after that, on 28th March 2008, the High Court interfered and remanded the case to the Trial Court to try the accused for the offence of gangrape under Section 376(2)(g) of the IPC. The Trial Court acquitted the accused by the impugned judgment dated 24th September 2008.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court noted that the incident was of 1989 and nearly thirty-five years had passed since then. The accused and their families had moved ahead in life, and there were adequate reasons to warrant the exercise of powers under the proviso to Section 376(2) of the IPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

The High Court was dealing with an incident that had taken place twenty-eight years back, and, in the meantime, the accused and their families had moved ahead in life. The gravity of the offence was also considered while passing the judgment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's conclusion was the only possible conclusion based on the evidence on record. Both the appeals were accordingly dismissed. The accused Vijay was granted one month to surrender before the Trial Court to undergo the remaining sentence in terms of the impugned judgment of the High Court.

The original decree was for Rs. 27,694/-, but it was subsequently modified to Rs. 17,120/-. The sale of the attached properties was conducted at a low price of Rs. 34,000/-.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the execution sale cannot be set aside as the judgment debtor has not paid any amount to satisfy the original or modified decree, nor has he challenged the legality of the auction sale on any permissible ground. However, the court did not accept this submission and instead focused on whether the present is a fit and suitable case for exercising power under Section 144 CPC directing restitution in favour of the judgment debtor.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the execution of a decree by sale of the entire immovable property of the judgment debtor is not intended to penalize him but rather to grant relief to the decree holder. However, the right of a decree holder should never be construed as a bonanza for exploiting the judgment debtor by selling his entire property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that it was a fit and suitable case for exercising power under Section 144 CPC directing restitution in favour of the judgment debtor. The sale of the attached properties belonging to the judgment debtor is set aside, and the parties are restored back to the position where the execution was positioned before the attachment of the immovable properties of the judgment debtor. If not already satisfied, the execution of the modified decree shall proceed in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a minor pregnant woman who was allowed to terminate her pregnancy by the court. However, she and her parents later decided to continue the pregnancy to term. The court had to consider their new decision while taking into account the original order allowing termination of pregnancy.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case include:

*   The right to reproductive autonomy and choice is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, as held by the Supreme Court in Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh Administration (2009).
*   In cases where there is a divergence of opinion between a minor pregnant woman and her guardian, the court must consider the view of the minor woman as an important factor while deciding on the termination of pregnancy.
*   The medical board's decision to terminate or continue a pregnancy must be guided by sound and cogent reasons, taking into account both the physical and emotional well-being of the pregnant woman.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations in this case include:

*   The court emphasized the importance of considering the views of minor women in reproductive autonomy cases.
*   The medical board's role is crucial in making decisions regarding termination or continuation of pregnancy, and their opinions must be guided by sound reasoning.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment issued by the Supreme Court includes:

*   The court ordered that all expenses related to the minor woman's hospitalization shall be borne by Sion Hospital.
*   In case the minor woman and her parents desire to give the child up for adoption, the State Government is directed to take necessary steps in accordance with applicable law.
*   The court concluded that the medical board must evaluate both physical and emotional well-being of the pregnant person while making a decision regarding termination or continuation of pregnancy.
*   The consent of a pregnant person is paramount in decisions related to reproductive autonomy and termination of pregnancy, especially where there is a divergence of opinion between the minor woman and her guardian.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a writ petition filed by the appellants against Air India Limited (AIL) regarding various service-related issues. The writ petitions were instituted between 2011 and 2013, but the cause of action had accrued between 2007 and 2010.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:
- Whether the writ petitions are maintainable against Air India Limited after it has been disinvested and taken over by a private player?
- Whether the High Court could exercise its extraordinary writ jurisdiction to issue a writ to a private entity that was previously a government entity?
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- The respondent, Air India Limited, is no longer performing any public duty after being disinvested and taken over by a private player.
- The High Court cannot exercise its extraordinary writ jurisdiction to issue a writ to a private entity that was previously a government entity.
- The appellants have been denied equitable relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, but their rights to claim relief in law before the appropriate forum have been protected.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in the case is:
- The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court has sustained the preliminary objection qua maintainability of the writ petitions preferred by the appellants and rejected the same as being not maintainable.
- The appeals are dismissed, and no order as to costs is made.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the respondent-employees and the Corporation. The respondents are employees of the Corporation who were directed to be granted permanent employment by an order of the Inspector of Labour under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. However, the Corporation has challenged this order in court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the Corporation include:
- The respondent-employees do not qualify for permanent employment as they have not continuously worked for 480 days or more for 24 months.
- Many of the persons directed to be granted permanent employment have found profitable employment elsewhere, and therefore, their claims should be dismissed.
- The respondents had not continued in service after a certain point in time, which disqualifies them from receiving permanent employment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that:
- The Corporation is an industrial establishment covered under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
- The respondent-employees have uninterruptedly continued in service for 480 days or more for 24 months, meeting the requirements of the act.
- The order of the Inspector of Labour directing permanent employment to the respondents was valid and should be complied with.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
- Both requirements for the establishment being covered under the definition of industrial establishment as provided in the act, and the employee having uninterruptedly continued in service for 480 days or more for 24 months have been met.
- The High Court had remanded the case to consider whether the Act would apply to the parties. However, since the High Court concluded that the Act would apply, there was no reason for it to disturb the finding of the Inspector of Labour.
- Therefore, the order of the Inspector of Labour directing permanent employment to the respondents should be complied with.
The appeal filed by the Corporation is dismissed, and the appeal filed by the respondent-Union through its President is allowed with all consequences in favour of the respondent-employees under the law to follow.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was convicted of murdering his wife. The incident occurred in 1995, and the trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment. He appealed to the High Court, which affirmed the conviction and sentence. The appeal then came to this Court for review.
The appellant had married the deceased in 1982 but divorced her using triple talaq in 1992. However, he later brought her back home. The incident that led to his conviction occurred in 1995.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellant was responsible for the murder of his wife, citing evidence from witnesses and forensic reports. They contended that the appellant had taken undue advantage of the situation and acted cruelly towards his wife.
The defense argued that there were mitigating circumstances in the case, including the fact that the appellant had been divorced by his wife using triple talaq and later brought her back home. They also pointed out that it took 16 years for the High Court to decide the appeal, during which time the appellant was released on bail.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that a fight suddenly takes place, for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. It is difficult to apportion the share of blame between them. The Court also noted that the appellant had taken undue advantage and acted cruelly towards his wife, even if she was the one who picked up the fight.
The Court took into account the mitigating circumstances in the case, including the fact that the appellant had spent almost 11 years in prison before being granted remission of sentence. The Court also noted that the appellant must be around 65 years old at this point and has spent half his life undergoing imprisonment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court upheld the conviction and sentence of the trial court, affirming the High Court's decision to reject the appeal. However, in light of the mitigating circumstances, the Court granted liberty to the appellant to prefer a representation for remission of sentence to the State Government.
The Court directed the State Government to consider the representation at the earliest and take an appropriate decision within four weeks from the date of receipt of the representation. The Court also disposed of any pending applications.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the murder of a woman named Usha. The accused, who is on bail, went missing for nearly 10 years after the incident and was later caught and put on trial.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution established several links in the chain of incriminating circumstantial evidence, including:
- Motive: The accused had a reason to kill his wife.
- Last seen together: The accused was last seen with the deceased on the night of the murder.
- Medical evidence: The cause of death was determined to be homicidal.
- Confessional note: A confessional note was found at the crime scene that matched the handwriting of the accused.
- Abscondence: The accused went missing for nearly 10 years after the incident, which is considered a strong circumstance pointing towards his guilt.
- Wrong explanation: The accused provided a wrong explanation for the homicidal death in his statement under Section 313 CrPC.
The prosecution argued that these facts, when connected together, form a complete and clinching chain of incriminating circumstances pointing exclusively towards the guilt of the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Information not available
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the prosecution had established a strong case against the accused. The court noted that the accused's absence for nearly 10 years after the incident and his failure to offer an explanation for the homicidal death were significant circumstances pointing towards his guilt.
The court confirmed the view taken by the trial Court and the High Court in convicting and affirming the conviction of the accused for the charge of committing murder.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the decision of a learned Single Judge, where the Judge exercised powers under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 32 of the Arbitration Act to terminate the arbitration proceedings. The appellant had filed a statement of claim, but the Arbitral Tribunal failed to fix a meeting for hearing until 11th March 2020.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties and the Court's analysis are as follows:
- The power under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 32 can be exercised only if, for some reason, the continuation of proceedings has become unnecessary or impossible. 
- The Arbitral Tribunal failed to record its satisfaction based on material on record that proceedings had become unnecessary or impossible.
- The failure of the claimant to request the Arbitral Tribunal to fix a date for hearing is no ground to conclude that the proceedings have become unnecessary.
- The abandonment of the claim by a claimant can be a ground to invoke clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 32. 
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that:
- There was no documentary or oral evidence on record to support the finding of the learned Arbitrator that there was abandonment of the claim by the first appellant.
- The finding of the learned Arbitrator is entirely illegal and could never have been rendered on the material before the Arbitral Tribunal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that:
- The appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.
- As the learned sole Arbitrator has withdrawn from the proceedings, the parties shall take necessary steps to get the substituted Arbitrator appointed in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the arrest and subsequent remand of an appellant on October 4, 2023. The grounds of arrest were not conveyed to the accused in writing before the order of remand was passed.
The High Court of Delhi had passed an impugned order on October 13, 2023, which was challenged by the appellant.
A charge sheet has been filed in this case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the appellant argued that the grounds of arrest were not conveyed to the accused in writing before the remand order was passed, which is a requirement under the law.
The court noted that the copy of the remand application was purportedly exercised as communication of the grounds of arrest in writing but was not provided to the accused or his counsel before the passing of the order of remand dated October 4, 2023.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There is a significant difference between 'reasons for arrest' and 'grounds of arrest'. The reasons for arrest are formal parameters, whereas grounds of arrest contain all details necessitating the arrest of the accused.
The court analyzed the arrest memo (Annexure P-7) and found that it nowhere conveys the grounds on which the accused was being arrested.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that since the grounds of arrest were not conveyed to the accused in writing before the order of remand dated October 4, 2023, the arrest and subsequent remand of the appellant are invalid in the eyes of law.
The court declared the impugned order passed by the High Court of Delhi on October 13, 2023, to be quashed and set aside.
The appellant is entitled to a direction for release from custody based on the ratio of the judgment rendered by this Court in the case of Pankaj Bansal (supra).
The court directed that the appellant shall be released from custody on furnishing bail and bonds to the satisfaction of the trial Court.

The appeal was allowed in these terms.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of appellants under Section 302, read with Section 149 of IPC. The prosecution's evidence includes statements from witnesses who claim to have seen the accused with the deceased at various times on the day of the incident.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to bring home the charge against the appellants due to inconsistencies in the testimony of eyewitnesses and the fact that the theory of last seen together is not sufficient to link the accused with the commission of the offence. The court observed that even assuming the accused were seen with the deceased, there was no evidence to rule out the involvement of other persons in the offence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted several instances where statements made by prosecution witnesses did not match the evidence presented by PW-11 (the investigating officer). The court also observed that the testimony of so-called eyewitnesses cannot be relied upon and that the theory of last seen together deserves to be rejected.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The impugned judgments of the Trial Court and High Court to the extent to which the appellants were convicted for the offence punishable under Section 302, read with Section 149 of IPC, are hereby set aside. The appellants are acquitted of charges against them.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant who is accused of committing an offence. The deceased made a dying declaration (Ex. 59) which was proved in evidence and attended doctor certified that the deceased was capable of narrating her statement. There were inconsistencies and improvements in the version of the prosecution witnesses, but there was convergence with the core of the narration of the deceased made in the dying declaration and the medical history recorded by the doctor.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented is that the evidence on record, particularly Ex. 59, clearly establishes the guilt of the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt. The court also considered the fact that the appellant has been on bail since 2016.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of the dying declaration of the deceased (Ex. 59). The court also noted that attending doctor certified that the deceased was capable of narrating her statement and the substance of the dying declaration is also borne out by the medical history of the patient recorded by the doctor.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is dismissed. The appellant is directed to surrender before the trial court within a period of two weeks from today to carry out his sentence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the reduction in share capital of a subsidiary company and its impact on the shareholding of an assessee. The assessee's shareholding was proportionately reduced due to the decrease in the company's capital.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* The reduction in share capital is considered as a "sale, exchange or relinquishment of the asset" under Section 2(47) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
* The transaction involves a return of capital by the company, which is equivalent to purchasing the shareholder's rights.
* This is an exception to the rule that no company limited by shares shall have the power to buy its own shares.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
* The Gujarat High Court and the Bombay High Court have taken similar views on this issue, considering the redemption of shares as a transfer under Section 2(47).
* The reduction or redemption of capital involves a return of capital by the company, which is equivalent to purchasing the shareholder's rights.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in the case states:
"The petition fails and is hereby dismissed."
The court ruled that the reduction in share capital of the subsidiary company and subsequent proportionate reduction in the shareholding of the assessee would be squarely covered within the ambit of the expression "sale, exchange or relinquishment of the asset" used in Section 2(47) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the addition of new accused under Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The petitioners were initially named as accused in the FIR but were not charge-sheeted by the police. Later, evidence surfaced that implicated them in the crime, and they were added to face trial.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The High Court held that the trial court has undoubted jurisdiction to add any person not being the accused before it to face the trial along with other accused persons if the court is satisfied at any stage of the proceedings on the evidence adduced. The petitioners' contention that they had initially been released by the police under Section 169 of the CrPC and shown in column No. 2 of the charge sheet did not exclude them from being added as new accused under Section 319.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observed that the power of the court under Section 319 is not controlled or governed by naming or not naming of the person concerned in the FIR, nor is it dependent upon submission of the chargesheet by the police against the person concerned. The closure report should be looked into promptly by the Court, and the court should not keep it pending for consideration for a long time.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court dismissed the petitioners' appeal, upholding the trial court's decision to add them as new accused under Section 319 of the CrPC. The court held that the principles of law regarding Section 319 are clear: the trial court has jurisdiction to add any person not being an accused before it to face the trial if satisfied on the evidence adduced.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a writ petition (Crl.) No. 166 of 2023, where the court made certain observations and directions in relation to FIRs filed against the petitioners. The order dated 04.07.2023 was passed by the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
No explicit arguments are mentioned in the provided text, but it can be inferred that the petitioners' lawyers argued for the modification or recall of the order dated 04.07.2023.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the order dated 04.07.2023 required to be modified due to several reasons, including:
* The directions given by the court could be misconstrued as observations on the merits of the case.
* Such directions could influence the adjudication of the case before the High Court.
* The court had inadvertently provided directions that were not necessary.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court passed a judgment modifying and recalling certain parts of the order dated 04.07.2023, as follows:
* The order dated 04.07.2023 stands recalled insofar as it pertains to ECIR No. ECIR/HIU-1/06/2023.
* It is left open to the High Court of Allahabad to consider the challenge to this FIR on merits and in accordance with law, uninfluenced by any observations made in the order dated 04.07.2023.
* The order dated 04.07.2023 stands modified by substituting certain words in paragraph 8 thereof.

<Facts>
The case involves the election of Karikho Kri from 44 Tezu (ST) Assembly Constituency of the State of Arunachal Pradesh. Nuney Tayang filed an election petition against Karikho Kri under Sections 100(1)(b), 100(1)(d)(i), and 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951, alleging corrupt practices and non-disclosure of certain information by Karikho Kri. The High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Arunachal Pradesh upheld the election petition, but the matter was appealed to the Supreme Court.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* Nuney Tayang's allegations against Karikho Kri for non-disclosure of certain information, including dues of municipal/property taxes payable by him and his wife, and the registration of three vehicles in the names of his wife and son.
* The linkage between separate issues by Nuney Tayang and failure to plead in detail and adduce sufficient evidence in relation to the non-compliance that would attract Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The observations made by the Supreme Court include:

* The High Court was in error in concluding that sufficient grounds were made out under Sections 100(1)(b), 100(1)(d)(i), and 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951 to invalidate the election of Karikho Kri.
* Non-disclosure of the three vehicles, that still remained registered in the names of his wife and son as on the date of filing of his nomination, did not amount to a 'corrupt practice' under Section 123(2) of the Act of 1951.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Supreme Court is as follows:

* Civil Appeal No. 4615 of 2023 filed by Karikho Kri was allowed, setting aside the Judgment and Order dated 17.07.2023 passed by the Itanagar Bench of the High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Arunachal Pradesh in Election Petition No.01(AP) of 2019.
* The election of Karikho Kri as the returned candidate from 44 Tezu (ST) Assembly Constituency of the State of Arunachal Pradesh was upheld.
* Civil Appeal No. 4716 of 2023, filed by Nuney Tayang, was dismissed.

<FACTS>
The case involves the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in India. The petitioners, Gene Campaign and another, challenged the decision of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) to grant conditional approval for environmental release of DMH-11, a GMO crop. The respondents include the Union of India and other government authorities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the introduction of GMOs in India poses risks to human health and the environment. They sought judicial review of the decision taken by the GEAC and MoEF (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change) to grant conditional approval for environmental release of DMH-11.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that judicial review of the decision taken by the bodies concerned in the matter of GMOs is permissible. The Court also noted that the MoEF&CC shall conduct a national consultation, preferably within the next four months, with the aim of formulating the National Policy on GM crops.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court issued the following directions:
i. The respondent-Union of India is directed to evolve a National Policy with regard to GM crops in the realm of research, cultivation, trade, and commerce in the country.
ii. For the aforesaid purpose, the MoEF&CC shall conduct a national consultation, preferably within the next four months, with the aim of formulating the National Policy on GM crops.
iii. Respondent – Union of India must ensure that all credentials and past records of any expert who participates in the decision-making process should be scrupulously verified and conflict of interest, if any, should be declared and suitably mitigated by ensuring representation to a wide range of interests.
iv. In the matter of importing of GM food and more particularly GM edible oil, the respondent shall comply with the requirements of Section 23 of FSSA, 2006, which deals with packaging and labelling of foods.

The Registry shall place the matter before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for constituting an appropriate Bench to consider the said aspect afresh.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal by the appellants against their conviction under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. The trial court had convicted them based on statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act, which are considered confessional in nature.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants' counsel were that the officers who recorded their statements did not have the power to investigate or file a police report and therefore, their statements cannot be considered as confessional under Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) 1872.
Furthermore, it was argued that Section 67 is at an antecedent stage to investigation and does not fall within the category of confessional statements. Hence, the admissibility of such statements against the accused in a trial cannot be questioned.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are based on the majority view in the 3-Judges' Bench decision in Tofan Singh (supra), which held that officers empowered under Section 53 of the NDPS Act are police officers within the meaning of Section 25 of the IEA, and any confessional statement made to them would be barred under Section 25 of the IEA.
The court also observed that statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional statement in the trial of an offence under the NDPS Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Based on the above observations, the court allowed the appeals by setting aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and that of the Trial Court. The appellants were acquitted of the charges framed against them due to the inadmissibility of their statements under Section 67 of the NDPS Act.
The pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court of Judicature for a State issued a Full Court Resolution on 29 January 2013, and later modified it on 30 November 2021, prescribing that candidates for appointment to the Higher Judicial Service should have a minimum of 50% both in the written test as well as in the viva voce independently. The State Government referred the matter to the Union Government instead of consulting with the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given case. However, it can be inferred that the State Government argued against the Full Court Resolution and sought reference to the Union Government, while the High Court defended its decision.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The importance of control wielded by High Courts over the District Judiciary was emphasized in numerous decisions. The Rules under Article 309 have to be implemented where specific provisions are made. In cases where the Rules were silent, it is open to the High Court to issue administrative directions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the State Government travelled beyond the remit of consultation with the High Court by referring the matter to the Union Government. The High Court's decision was affirmed as not suffering from any legal or other infirmity. The appeals were dismissed, and pending applications stood disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court is considering whether a spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 can seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argues that even if the marriage is declared void, the court can still grant interim relief under Section 24, provided certain conditions are met. The respondent contends that a grant of permanent alimony under Section 25 is discretionary and should only be considered if the conduct of the parties warrants it.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that the discretion to grant relief under Sections 24 and 25 is not absolute, but rather depends on the facts of each case. The conduct of the parties, including any misconduct or wrongdoing, can be taken into account when deciding whether to grant interim or permanent alimony.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that a spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. However, the grant of relief under Section 25 is discretionary and depends on the facts of each case and the conduct of the parties.
Additionally, even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding, the court is not precluded from granting maintenance pendente lite provided the conditions mentioned in Section 24 are satisfied.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal against the grant of bail to respondent No.1 in a scam case where several people were affected financially. The respondent had already been incarcerated for about six months before being granted bail.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* The High Court erred in law by granting bail to the respondent without considering the principles governing the exercise of such power.
* The respondent's release on bail could lead to the dissipation of properties where investments had allegedly been made out of society funds, affecting the interests of victims.
* Although the respondent had already suffered incarceration for a period of about six months, their release on bail could still pose a risk to the trial and the victims' interests.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
* The plurality of principles governing the exercise of power to grant bail were mentioned, including relevant case-law.
* The respondent's medical condition was taken into consideration by the court, directing authorities to provide appropriate care and assistance.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case states that:
* The appeal succeeds, and the impugned order stands set aside.
* Respondent No.1 is directed to surrender within a period of three weeks from the date of the order, failing which the trial Court shall proceed accordingly.
* Liberty has been granted to the respondent to apply for bail at a later period or in the event of a change in circumstances.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals related to a trial that has been pending for nearly 25 years. The appellants are seeking discharge from the trial, citing various grounds and relying on orders from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The proceedings under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) against the appellants are being challenged.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' arguments include:
- Relying on an order from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which they claim exonerates them from any wrongdoing.
- Arguing that the charges against them are groundless and that there is no sufficient material to proceed with the trial.
- Citing the minority of one of the appellants (Puneet Sabharwal) as a ground for discharge.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes:
- The appellants have not made out a case to say that the charges are groundless, and the prosecution's material warrants the framing of charge.
- The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal order is not relevant to the PCA proceedings, as it relates to assessment of income rather than the source of income or allegations of disproportionate assets.
- The trial has been pending for nearly 25 years, and the court directs that it be expeditiously concluded on or before December 31, 2024.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a writ petition filed by the petitioner, seeking directions to the respondent (a nodal agency) to revisit and modify an Office Memorandum dated 10.08.2022, which provided guidelines for persons with disabilities (PwDs) in writing examinations. The petitioner alleged that the guidelines were not being uniformly implemented across authorities and recruitment agencies.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the respondent's guidelines should be enforced to extend benefits for PwD candidates in writing examinations, without any hindrance. They contended that the rights under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution can be enforced even against private entities and overrides the principle laid down in Rajbir (supra). The petitioner also cited the RPwD Act, 2016, which emphasizes the importance of 'reasonable accommodation' for PwDs.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Office Memorandum issued by the respondent was applicable to all authorities and recruitment agencies. It noted that the benefits conferred by the statute should be provided to all PwD candidates, without any hindrance. The court also highlighted the importance of ensuring compliance with the guidelines and the need for sensitization drives at educational institutions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the respondent to revisit the Office Memorandum dated 10.08.2022, remove restrictions, and grant relaxations in a reasonable manner. The court ordered the following actions:
- Direct all authorities/recruitment agencies/examining bodies to uniformly follow the guidelines issued by the respondent.
- Carry out periodic sensitization drives at educational institutions to raise awareness among examination conducting bodies.
- Set up a grievance redressal portal for candidates to register complaints before approaching the court of law.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an arbitration petition filed by the appellant against respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2, seeking to recover a sum of Rs. 1,18,48,069/- along with interest from respondent no. 1 for transactions undertaken in respondent no. 2's account.
Bye-law 248(a) and Bye-law 227(a) are central to the case, as they pertain to the arbitration jurisdiction and the broker's lien, respectively.
The arbitral award was passed on February 26, 2004, but the High Court set it aside on April 29, 2021, citing patent illegality and perversity.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the oral contract between respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2, making respondent no. 1 jointly and severally liable for transactions in respondent no. 2's account, fell within the scope of arbitration under Bye-law 248(a).
The High Court re-appreciated evidence and examined the merits of the award, which was not within its jurisdiction under Section 37.
Bye-laws 227(a) and 248(a) support the adjustment of accounts by the broker, allowing for the lien on respondent no. 1's account due to joint liability with respondent no. 2.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The arbitral tribunal held that written authorization was not required for adjusting accounts under Bye-law 227(a).
Bye-laws 227(a) and 248(a) support the adjustment of accounts by the broker, allowing for the lien on respondent no. 1's account due to joint liability with respondent no. 2.
The High Court re-appreciated evidence and examined the merits of the award, which was not within its jurisdiction under Section 37.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court sets aside the impugned order of the High Court and upholds the arbitral award dated February 26, 2004.
Respondent no. 1 is jointly and severally liable along with respondent no. 2 to pay the appellant Rs. 1,18,48,069/- along with 9% interest p.a. from May 1, 2001, till date of repayment as directed by the arbitral tribunal.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a dispute related to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006. The assessee had filed an appeal against an order passed by the MSEFC (Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council), which was acting as an arbitral tribunal under the MSMED Act. The assessee sought to challenge the order on grounds of extreme hardship and argued that the writ petition should not be dismissed due to the availability of an alternative remedy.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The applicability of the principle of adequate alternative remedy in cases involving MSEFC orders
- The interpretation of Section 18 of the MSMED Act, which deals with conciliation proceedings and the role of MSEFC as a conciliator
- The question of whether MSEFC members who undertake conciliation proceedings can also act as arbitrators of the arbitral tribunal
- The scope of judicial review in cases where the disputed amount is required to be deposited to avail statutory remedy
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the court include:
- A divergence of opinion on the question of adequate alternative remedy in cases involving MSEFC orders
- The need for a more nuanced approach to address extreme hardship and provide breathing time for payment
- The importance of considering the specific circumstances of each case when determining the maintainability of writ petitions against MSEFC orders
</Observations>

Judgment>
The court has referred the following questions to a larger Bench of five Judges:
(i) Whether the ratio in M/s India Glycols Limited (supra) completely bars or prohibits the maintainability of the writ petition before the High Court?
(ii) If the bar/prohibition is not absolute, when and under what circumstances will the principle/restriction of adequate alternative remedy not apply?
(iii) Whether the members of MSEFC who undertake conciliation proceedings can themselves act as arbitrators of the arbitral tribunal in terms of Section 18 of the MSMED Act read with Section 80 of the A&C Act?

The Registry has been directed to place the papers before the Chief Justice for the constitution of a larger Bench.
</Judgment>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between two parties regarding the sale of an immovable property. The alleged contract for the sale was executed between the parties through exchange of communications dated 16.01.2004 and 20.01.2004 respectively. The stipulation in the contract includes payment of 10% of the total sale consideration immediately, 85% by 28.02.2004, and the balance 5% at the time of notice for possession of the premises. The parties also agreed that the possession of the suit property would be handed over by the defendants to the plaintiff upon payment of the balance 5% of the total sale consideration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiffs argued that the transfer of possession of the immovable property is implicit in the contract and the absence of a specific prayer seeking transfer of possession would not affect the character of the suit. They further contended that if the court were to hold otherwise, it would lead to a situation where the plaintiff could file a suit for specific performance simpliciter, obtain a decree, and then seek amendment of the plaint to include a prayer for transfer of possession.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court mention several precedents. The court noted that in Babu Lal (supra), it was held that in view of the interplay between Sections 22 and 28 of the Specific Relief Act respectively and Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act, the handing over of possession of the immovable property in respect of which a decree of specific performance has been granted is only incidental. The court also cited Moolji Jaitha (supra), where it was held that the nature of the Suit and its purpose have to be determined by reading the Plaint as a whole, and not by dissecting the prayers.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states that the Special Leave Petitions fail and are hereby dismissed. The interim relief granted earlier stands vacated. It is now for the plaintiff to take appropriate steps to present the plaint before the court of competent jurisdiction and get his suit adjudicated on merits in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant has been incarcerated for 15 months or more for an offence punishable under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The trial of the scheduled offences and, consequently, the PMLA offence is not likely to be completed in three to four years or even more. The appellant's influential position in the State may have resulted in a so-called compromise between the bribe givers and the bribe takers.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court observed that the appellant's detention for such an extended period would amount to an infringement of his fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees a speedy trial. The learned Solicitor General (SG) relied upon cases where stringent conditions were imposed due to the fear of tampering with evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that clean acquittals are granted by criminal courts to accused individuals after very long incarceration as undertrials, resulting in crucial years being lost from their lives. This can give rise to a claim for compensation under Article 21 of the Constitution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the appellant shall be enlarged on bail till the final disposal of CC No. 9 of 2023 pending before the Principal Session Judge, Chennai. The conditions for bail include:
a. Furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.25,00,000/ with two sureties in the like amount;
b. Not directly or indirectly attempting to contact or communicate with the prosecution witnesses and victims of the three scheduled offences;
c. Marking attendance every Monday and Friday between 11 am and 12 noon in the office of the Deputy Director, the Directorate of Enforcement at Chennai;
d. Surrendering his passport to the Special Court under the PMLA at Chennai;
e. Regularly and punctually remaining present before the Courts dealing with scheduled offences as well as the Special Court and cooperating with the Courts for early disposal of cases; 
f. If seeking adjournments on non-existing or frivolous grounds, creating hurdles in the early disposal of the mentioned cases may result in cancellation of bail.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The High Court had quashed the criminal proceedings against the accused in Spl. S.C. No. 170 of 2023 on the ground that the victim's mother did not report the incident within a month as required by Section 21(1) of POCSO.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The judgment highlights the following arguments:
* The petitioner's argument that the High Court erred in quashing the criminal proceedings against the accused under POCSO Act, 2012.
* The respondent's (High Court) argument that the mother did not report the incident within a month as required by Section 21(1) of POCSO Act, 2012.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The judgment makes the following observations:
* The court emphasized the importance of reporting incidents under POCSO Act, 2012 and the need for public awareness about the same.
* The court noted that the victim's mother did report the incident within a reasonable time frame and that the delay was not due to any negligence on her part.
* The court observed that the High Court erred in quashing the criminal proceedings against the accused without considering the provisions of Section 21(1) of POCSO Act, 2012 correctly.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment sets aside the impugned order passed by the High Court and restores the criminal proceedings in Spl. S.C. No. 170 of 2023 to the court of Sessions Judge, Mahila Neethi Mandram (Fast Track Court), Tiruvallur District.
The court also directed the Registry to send one copy each of this judgment to the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Law & Justice, Union of India and to the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Union of India for undertaking appropriate course of action.

<FUNCTIONS>
Applicable legal principles, such as bail being a rule and refusal an exception.
The objective to keep a person in judicial custody pending trial or disposal of an appeal is to secure the attendance of the prisoner at trial.
</FUNCTONS>

<FACTS>
An ED case (HIU-II/14/2022) was registered against the appellant, while a CBI FIR (RC0032022A0053 of 2022) was also registered against him.
The case involved thousands of pages of documents and over a lakh pages of digitized documents.
493 witnesses were named in the case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period would not deprive his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.
The appellant's counsel argued that bail should be granted as there was no possibility of tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses, and conditions could be imposed to ensure his attendance at trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty should not be permitted to become punishment without trial.
The case largely depended on documentary evidence that was already seized by the prosecution.
There was no possibility of tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses, and stringent conditions could be imposed upon the appellant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were allowed, and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Delhi in Bail Application Nos. 1557 and 1559 of 2024 was quashed and set aside.
The appellant was directed to be released on bail in connection with ED Case No. HIU-II/14/2022 registered against him by the ED and FIR No. RC0032022A0053 of 2022 registered against him by the CBI.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case deals with the interpretation of Section 18 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act (MSMED Act) read with Section 80 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (A&C Act). The facts of the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:

* The MSEFC, which undertakes conciliation proceedings, cannot act as an arbitrator in terms of Section 18 of the MSMED Act read with Section 80 of the A&C Act.
* The assessee may not be able to acquire an absolute stay of the recovery of tax until the dispute is resolved, but they will certainly be able to get breathing time to pay up the same where their case deserves it.
* There is a divergence of opinion regarding whether the disputed amount needs to be deposited to avail the statutory remedy, and some cases have attempted to find a solution to provide support in cases involving extreme hardship.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The construction of Section 18 of the MSMED Act read with Section 80 of the A&C Act vests in the appellate authority a power to deal with the appeal otherwise than by way of final disposal even if the disputed tax is not paid.
* The interpretation will greatly ameliorate the genuine grievances and hardships faced by the assessee in the payment of the tax as determined.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is that:

* The Registry is directed to place the papers before the Chief Justice so that an appropriate decision can be taken on the administrative side for the constitution of a larger Bench in the present case.
* Two questions are referred to a larger Bench of five Judges:
	1. Whether the ratio in M/s India Glycols Limited that a writ petition could never be entertained against any order/award of the MSEFC, completely bars or prohibits maintainability of the writ petition before the High Court?
	2. If the bar/prohibition is not absolute, when and under what circumstances will the principle/restriction of adequate alternative remedy not apply?
	3. Whether the members of MSEFC who undertake conciliation proceedings, upon failure, can themselves act as arbitrators of the arbitral tribunal in terms of Section 18 of the MSMED Act read with Section 80 of the A&C Act?

The questions will subsume the question of when and in what situation a writ petition can be entertained against an order/award passed by MSEFC acting as an arbitral tribunal or conciliator.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two appeals related to the exploitation of a domestic worker. Ajay Malik's appeal (SLP (Crl.) No. 8777/2022) challenges the High Court's judgment dated 01.09.2022 in Criminal Misc. Application No. 96/2018, which upheld a FIR and chargesheet against him. Ashok Kumar's appeal (SLP (Crl.) No. 15131/2024) challenges the High Court's order dated 12.01.2021 in Criminal Revision No. 173/2019, which dismissed his petition.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by Ajay Malik and Ashok Kumar are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that their appeals were based on the exploitation of a domestic worker and the alleged improper handling of the case by law enforcement and the judiciary.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observes that the democratic setup of India is governed by the doctrine of separation of powers, which prevents the judiciary from straying into legislative matters. The court expresses faith in the Legislature to ensure an equitable and dignified life for domestic workers.

The Supreme Court allows Ajay Malik's appeal, sets aside the Impugned Judgement dated 01.09.2022, and quashes the FIR No. 60/2017 (Case Crime No. 94/2017) and all other proceedings against him. The court dismisses Ashok Kumar's appeal and upholds the High Court's order dated 12.01.2021 in Criminal Revision No. 173/2019.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant's legal team were not clearly mentioned in the given case. However, it can be inferred that they argued against the framing of charges against the appellant for the offenses punishable under Section 302, IPC, and 120-B with the aid of Section 34, IPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court were critical of the High Court's decision to confirm the order of the Trial Court. The court noted that there was no ground for a prima facie case revealed from the materials produced by the prosecution against the appellant. The court also observed that the mere fact that the application for discharge was rejected is not sufficient to confirm the impugned order.

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was dismissed by the court.
The decision in Rajpal Singh v. Saroj (supra) was held to be inapplicable to the current case.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the acquittal of respondents in a criminal appeal under Section 19 of the TADA Act. The respondents were accused of kidnapping and subsequent murder of Shri H.L. Khera, the then General Manager, HMT Watch Factory, Srinagar. The prosecution's case centered around the confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2), which was recorded by Shri A.K. Suri (PW-3). However, this statement was rejected in a previous criminal appeal, and the present appeal also fails due to lack of evidence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution relied on the confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2) as primary evidence against the respondents. However, this statement was rejected by the court in a previous criminal appeal. The respondents' defense team argued that there was no concrete evidence to link them to the crime.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the procedural safeguards were not followed in recording the confessional statements of the accused persons. The statements were recorded in a BSF camp and JIC, which cannot be considered as a "free atmosphere" for the accused persons. The court also noted that the draconian provisions of TADA Act have since been repealed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the criminal appeal, stating that there was no error or infirmity in the view taken by the Special Court in acquitting the respondents. The court held that the prosecution's case relied heavily on the rejected confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2), and therefore, the present appeal also fails.

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that no substantial question relating to environment had arisen, nor was there any violation of enactments specified in Schedule-I. They contended that the Tribunal had committed gross error by assuming jurisdiction and giving directions that were legally untenable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that while economic development should not be allowed to take place at the cost of ecology or environment, neither should environmental preservation hamper economic developments. The concept of "sustainable development" was emphasized as essential for maintaining a balance between the right to environment and development.

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned SG relied upon decisions that indicate the appellant's influential position in the State may have resulted in a compromise between the bribe givers and the bribe takers. Considering the apprehension of the appellant tampering with evidence, stringent conditions must be imposed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that there are cases where clean acquittal is granted by the criminal courts to the accused after very long incarceration as an undertrial. When we say clean acquittal, we are excluding the cases where the witnesses have turned hostile or there is a bona fide defective investigation.

<FACTS>
The case involves an inquiry proceeding under the Act, where the Inquiry Officer is appointed to decide on the eviction of unauthorized occupants from public premises. The respondents had raised several points before the High Court, including impleading the State Government and the competence of the Inquiry Officer to proceed without regulations being framed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that the Inquiry Officer was biased as he was an officer of the first appellant and could not be considered an independent quasi-judicial authority. They also contended that the proceedings should be kept in abeyance until regulations were framed under section 105H of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had already rendered a finding on the issue of bias, holding that the Inquiry Officer was an independent quasi-judicial officer under the Act. The court also observed that mere non-framing of regulations would not entitle the respondents to keep the proceedings in abeyance.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the Inquiry Officer had the competence to proceed with the inquiry, despite the absence of regulations being framed under section 105H of the Act. The court also set aside the impugned order of the High Court, which had entertained writ petitions that were not maintainable in their form. The Supreme Court directed the Inquiry Officer to allow both parties to lead evidence and raise whatever points are available in defense, and to proceed to independently notice contentions and issues arising for his decision on the basis of evidence led.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, Perumal Raja @ Perumal, was accused of murdering his son Rajini @ Rajinikanth. The case involved a disclosure statement made by the appellant on 25.04.2008 (Exhibit P-37) during the investigation into another murder case (FIR No. 204 of 2008). The statement led to the recovery of several incriminating articles, including a blood-stained knife and a piece of fabric with human tissue attached.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution relied on the disclosure statement made by the appellant as primary evidence. The court applied Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, which allows for the admissibility of statements made by an accused person regarding facts that were previously unknown but subsequently discovered through their actions. The defense argued that the disclosure statement was unreliable and that the prosecution had failed to establish a clear link between the appellant's involvement in the murder.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the murders of Rajaram (23.11.2007) and Rajini @ Rajinikanth (21.04.2008) were separate incidents, with no direct connection between them. The trial court had acquitted the co-accused due to a lack of evidence against them. The prosecution's case relied heavily on the disclosure statement made by the appellant.

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Perumal Raja @ Perumal, relying on the disclosure statement and the incriminating articles recovered as a result. The court rejected the defense's arguments regarding the reliability of the disclosure statement and the lack of evidence linking the appellant to the murder. The acquittal of co-accused was confirmed due to insufficient evidence against them.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a composite suit filed for cancellation of the sale deed and recovery of possession. The original plaintiff, now represented through her heirs, sought to cancel the sale deed dated 19-4-1996 and recover possession.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court treated the relief for possession as a consequential prayer and the relief for cancellation of Sale Deed as the substantive prayer. The limitation period should be considered with respect to the substantive relief of cancellation of Sale Deed, which would be three years from the date of knowledge of the Sale Deed sought to be cancelled.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute over the entitlement of shares in a property. The first partition suit was decreed, and the matter has been ongoing for over two decades. The High Court observed that the pre-emption Act, 1973, does not apply to the case, but this observation is later deemed incorrect by the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in the case is that the objections of the appellant should be decided afresh on merits. The High Court's observation regarding the pre-emption Act is challenged, and it is argued that the matter has been pending for too long.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court notes that the discussion of pre-emption in the first partition suit judgment appears to correspond to an earlier transaction in the 1930s and 1940s. The High Court's observation regarding the pre-emption Act is deemed incorrect.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allows the appeals and remands the matter to the First Appellate Court for a decision on the objections of the appellant afresh, on merits. The Court clarifies that it has not expressed any view on the facts of the case. The matter is requested to be disposed of expeditiously due to its long-pending nature.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was previously convicted and sentenced to death by the Trial Court. The High Court later acquitted him, but with a direction for reinvestigation by a different investigation agency.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that the right enshrined in Article 20(2) of the Indian Constitution, which prohibits double jeopardy, was violated in this case. The defense contended that since the High Court's acquittal had to remain in force and the subsequent reinvestigation by a different agency meant starting from zero, the conditions for double jeopardy were met.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the principle of double jeopardy is unquestionable under Indian law. The court noted that there are three conditions for double jeopardy: previous valid proceedings before a competent court, conviction or acquittal in force at the time of subsequent proceedings, and fresh proceedings for the same offense.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the defense's argument was correct, and the right enshrined in Article 20(2) had been violated. The court stated that since the first condition (previous valid proceedings) and the second condition (conviction or acquittal in force) were met, the subsequent reinvestigation by a different agency meant starting from zero, thus meeting the third condition (fresh proceedings). The Supreme Court quashed and set aside all subsequent proceedings and acquitted the appellant of all charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of the High Court, dated 03.04.2023, refusing to grant bail to the appellant. The appellant is accused of committing a serious offense and has been in custody for some time.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the counsel for the appellant are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the defense team argued that the continued incarceration of the appellant was unjustified and requested bail.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Several observations are made by the court:

* The right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution is considered sacrosanct.
* A three-judge bench decision (K.A. Najeeb) is binding on a two-judge bench like the one deciding this case.
* Continued incarceration of the appellant cannot be justified, and bail should be granted.

The court also mentions several previous judgments that support the granting of bail:

* K.A. Najeeb
* Frank Vitus
* Gurwinder Singh

These cases are distinguished on their facts, but they all emphasize the importance of considering the right to life and personal liberty when deciding bail applications.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court sets aside the impugned order of the High Court and quashes it. The appellant is directed to be released on bail subject to certain conditions:

* The trial court shall impound the passport and/or citizenship document(s) of the appellant.
* The appellant shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court and shall furnish his address to the trial court.
* He shall appear before the trial court on each and every date of the trial.
* In addition to the above, the appellant shall mark his attendance before the police station indicated by the trial court once in every fortnight till conclusion of the trial.
* He shall not tamper with the evidence and shall not threaten the witnesses.

If there is any violation of these bail conditions, it would be open to the prosecution to move the trial court for cancellation of bail.

The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, specifically sub-sections (1) and (2). The facts are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are centered around the proper interpretation of Section 14. The court seems to be considering the principles laid down in various judgments, particularly those from cases such as Karmi, Bhura, and Gumpha. There is no clear mention of opposing sides or specific arguments.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The court notes that there are many decisions that are inconsistent with each other on principle but have tried to negotiate a contrary view by distinguishing them on facts or by simply ignoring the binding decision.
- The court observes that there must be clarity and certainty in the interpretation of Section 14 of the Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment includes:
- The court directs the Registry to place the order along with the appeal paper book before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constituting an appropriate larger bench for reconciling the principles laid down in various judgments of this Court and for restating the law on the interplay between sub-section (1) and (2) of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 29A(4) and (5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The main issue is whether an application for extension of time period for passing an arbitral award can be made after the expiry of the twelve-month or extended six-month period.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court examines various provisions under Section 29A(4) and (5), including:
- Sub-section (4): Provides for a maximum time limit of 12 months from the date of the appointment of the sole arbitrator or the presiding officer, in case of a three-member arbitral tribunal.
- Sub-section (5): Allows an application to be made by the arbitral tribunal for extension of period for making the award beyond the prescribed time limit.
- The first proviso: Requires that no extension shall be granted unless the parties jointly make an application for such extension.
- The second proviso: Mandates that the mandate of the arbitral tribunal continues even if an application under sub-section (5) is pending.

The court also refers to other relevant provisions, including:
- Section 11(4)(a): Provides for the appointment of a new arbitrator in case the originally appointed arbitrator fails or refuses to act.
- Sections 29A(6) and (7): Relate to the substitution of an arbitrator and the recommencement of arbitral proceedings from the stage already reached by the newly constituted tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
- The legislative intent is to effectuate efficiency and expediency in the arbitral process, as evident from provisions such as Sections 29A(6) to (8).
- An interpretation which produces unreasonable results should be avoided, and if possible, a more acceptable, practical, and pragmatic construction should be adopted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that an application for extension of time period for passing an arbitral award under Section 29A(4) read with Section 29A(5) is maintainable even after the expiry of the twelve-month or extended six-month period. The court also emphasizes that such applications will be guided by the principle of sufficient cause and the observations made in paragraph 15.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the orders of the Tribunal, which assumed jurisdiction and gave directions that were untenable in law. The Tribunal had directed the respondent to remove trees, but no substantial question relating to environment had arisen, nor was there any violation of enactments specified in Schedule-I.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the Tribunal had committed a gross error by assuming jurisdiction and giving directions that were untenable in law. The petitioner relied on various case laws, including Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India [(1996) 5 SCC 281] , to support their argument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The right to clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, but so is the right to development through industrialization.
- There is a need for "sustainable development" that harmonizes and strikes a balance between the right to development and the right to clean environment.
- The concept of "sustainable development" is an integral part of "life" under Article 21.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:
- The impugned Orders passed by the Tribunal are set aside, being without jurisdiction and legally untenable.
- The Appeals stand allowed accordingly.

<Facts>
The case involves a dispute between Ram Kishori Gupta and Harishchandra Gupta against SEBI, regarding a disgorgement order dated 28.09.2018. The appellants had filed an appeal against the Tribunal's order dated 02.08.2019, which was set aside by the Securities Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No. 44 of 2019.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by SEBI include:
- The exercise undertaken by SEBI after the passing of the final order dated 31.07.2014, resulting in the disgorgement order dated 28.09.2018, was unsustainable in law.
- The compensation claim of Ram Kishori Gupta and Harishchandra Gupta against SEBI stood decided by the Tribunal's order dated 30.04.2013, which also attained finality.
- The directions in that regard by the WTMs of SEBI in the orders dated 16.12.2014 and 01.04.2016, culminating in the direction for restitution by the Tribunal in its judgment dated 02.08.2019 in Appeal No. 44 of 2019, cannot be sustained.
- The Tribunal was not justified in setting aside the disgorgement order dated 29.08.2018, and the direction to mulct SEBI with exorbitant costs payable to the appellants is completely unsustainable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The entire exercise undertaken by SEBI after the passing of the final order dated 31.07.2014 was unsustainable in law.
- The compensation claim of Ram Kishori Gupta and Harishchandra Gupta against SEBI stood decided by the Tribunal's order dated 30.04.2013, which also attained finality.
- The directions in that regard by the WTMs of SEBI in the orders dated 16.12.2014 and 01.04.2016, culminating in the direction for restitution by the Tribunal in its judgment dated 02.08.2019 in Appeal No. 44 of 2019, cannot be sustained.
- The Tribunal was fully justified in setting aside the disgorgement order dated 29.08.2018.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed Civil Appeal 7941 of 2019 and set aside the judgment dated 02.08.2019 passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai, in Appeal No. 44 of 2019. The court also dismissed Civil Appeal (Diary) No. 42829 of 2019 as it was unsustainable in law. Lastly, the court allowed Civil Appeal Nos.1649-1652 of 2022 to the extent that the direction to mulct SEBI with exorbitant costs payable to the appellants is set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a contempt petition filed by the Bank against the Borrower and the Subsequent Transferee for violating court orders. The Borrower had taken a loan of Rs. 400 crore from the Bank, which was secured by a mortgage on a certain property known as the Secured Asset. However, the Borrower failed to repay the loan and subsequently entered into an Assignment Agreement with the Subsequent Transferee, assigning the rights and obligations under the loan agreement to it. The Subsequent Transferee then filed a petition in the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) seeking to set aside the notice of sale issued by the Bank for the recovery of the loan amount.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Bank argued that the Assignment Agreement was hit by lis pendens and was therefore void. It also contended that the Subsequent Transferee had no right to file a petition in the DRT challenging the notice of sale issued by the Bank. The Bank further submitted that the Subsequent Transferee's actions were in contempt of court, as it had failed to comply with the court orders.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Assignment Agreement was indeed hit by lis pendens and was void. It also noted that the Subsequent Transferee had no right to file a petition in the DRT challenging the notice of sale issued by the Bank. The court further held that the actions of the Borrower and the Subsequent Transferee were in contempt of court, as they had failed to comply with the court orders.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court passed the following directions:

* Confirmed the sale of the Secured Asset to the petitioner (the Bank) and declared the title conferred through the Sale Certificate dated 27.09.2023 to be absolute.
* Ordered the Borrower and the Bank to take steps for the cancellation of the Release Deed dated 28.08.2023 within a period of one week from the date of pronouncement.
* Directed the Borrower to unconditionally withdraw the S.A. No. 46 of 2022 pending before the DRT within a period of one week from the date of pronouncement.
* Declared the Assignment Agreement dated 28.08.2023 void and ordered the Subsequent Transferee to hand over the peaceful physical possession of the Secured Asset along with its original title deeds to the Bank within a period of one week from the date of pronouncement.
* Ordered the Subsequent Transferee to withdraw the police complaint dated 17.01.2024 lodged by it within a period of one week from the date of pronouncement of this judgment.
* Clarified that the Subsequent Transferee was not entitled to recover the amount paid by it towards redeeming the second charge over the Secured Asset or any other dues or amount paid in respect of the same from the petitioner (the Bank).
* Directed the Bank to refund the amount of Rs. 129 crore paid by the Borrower towards the redemption of mortgage without any interest only after the aforesaid directions had been complied with.
* Allowed the Subsequent Transferee to recover the amount paid by it towards the Assignment Agreement dated 28.08.2023 and any other amount from the Borrower by availing appropriate legal remedy as may be available under the law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of the High Court of Delhi, which refused to implead respondent nos. 2 and 3 as parties in the arbitration proceedings. The appellant had filed a claim in 2022 under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (ACA), but the arbitral tribunal did not initially include respondent nos. 2 and 3 as parties. The High Court also declined to implead them, holding that the arbitral tribunal lacked jurisdiction over these individuals.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that a notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the ACA is mandatory for determining limitation periods and applicable law, but it does not denude the arbitral tribunal of its jurisdiction to implead parties during proceedings. The appellant also contended that an application under Section 11 of the ACA only involves a limited prima facie examination into the existence of the arbitration agreement and its parties, and thus, a court's referral order does not finally determine this issue.

The appellant further argued that respondent nos. 2 and 3 are parties to the arbitration agreement in Clause 40 of the LLP Agreement despite being non-signatories, as their conduct is in accordance with and in pursuance of the terms of the agreement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Information not available
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court. The court directed that respondent nos. 2 and 3 be impleaded as parties before the arbitral tribunal, and the proceedings must be continued from the stage of the arbitral tribunal's order dated 15.02.2024.

The court also requested the arbitral tribunal to complete the hearings and pass its award as expeditiously as possible, considering that the claim was filed in 2022.

No order was made as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appeal of a respondent-accused against the judgment of acquittal entered by the High Court. The accused was convicted for an offense committed against 'V', a minor female. The prosecution's case relied on the testimony of PW-14 and the medical evidence, which pointed to the accused having committed the offense.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case revolve around the credibility of the witness PW-14 and the discrepancy between his statement in the FIR and his deposition in Court. The prosecution argued that despite the contradiction, the evidence of other witnesses, including the medical evidence, supports the prosecution's case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the purpose of cross-examination is to discredit the witness or elicit facts favorable to the opposing party. However, in this case, none of these criteria were met, and the discrepancy was not adequately addressed during cross-examination. The Court also noted that even if there was a contradiction, it may be considered material or immaterial depending on the circumstances of the case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the judgment of acquittal entered by the High Court is set aside. The original judgment of conviction returned by the Sessions Judge is restored. The respondent-accused is directed to surrender before the competent authority within four weeks from the date of this judgment to serve out the sentence as awarded by the learned Trial Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The questions posed to the court are:
    (i) Whether a spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 can seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25?
    (ii) If yes, whether such relief can be granted in cases where the conduct of one of the spouses is questionable?

The case does not explicitly mention specific facts about the parties involved.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court considers various arguments and precedents:
    - The meaning of Sections 24 and 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
    - Precedents on the interpretation of these sections in previous cases
    - Equitable considerations for granting maintenance under Section 25

The court also addresses hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate that discretionary relief can be granted or denied based on the conduct of the parties involved.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes the following key points:
- The grant of relief under Sections 24 and 25 is discretionary
- Conduct of the parties must be considered when granting maintenance under Section 25
- Equitable considerations apply when deciding on maintenance
- Prima facie conclusion about the marriage being void or voidable does not preclude interim maintenance

The court also addresses concerns that the interpretation might lead to "ridiculous results" but finds that discretionary relief can be tailored to each case's facts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court answers the questions as follows:
    (a) A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25, depending on the facts and conduct of each case.
    (b) Even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act, the court can grant maintenance pendente lite provided the conditions mentioned in Section 24 are satisfied.

The court directs the Registry to place these appeals before an appropriate Bench for decision on merits.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute related to the eviction of unauthorized occupants from public premises under the Delhi Development Authority Act, 1957. The first appellant was served with a notice for eviction, and an inquiry officer was appointed to conduct the proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents raised several points, including:
1. The Inquiry Officer's personal interest in the case due to being an officer of the first appellant.
2. The need to implead the State Government in the proceedings under section 105B of the Act.
3. The competence of the Inquiry Officer to proceed with the inquiry in the absence of regulations having been framed under section 105H of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court held that:
1. The Inquiry Officer was an independent quasi-judicial officer under the Act and did not have a personal interest in the case.
2. Impleading the State Government was unnecessary, as the subject premises belonged to the first appellant.
3. The absence of regulations under section 105H of the Act did not entitle the respondents to keep the proceedings in abeyance.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
1. The High Court erred in framing points for determination by the Inquiry Officer, as this was beyond its jurisdiction.
2. The Inquiry Officer should allow both parties to lead evidence and raise whatever points are available in defense.
3. The Inquiry Officer should proceed with the inquiry independently, noticing contentions and issues arising for his decision on the basis of evidence led and the defense raised by the respondents.
4. The proceedings can continue despite the absence of regulations under section 105H of the Act, as long as natural justice principles are adhered to.
5. The civil appeals were allowed, and the impugned order was set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by a person convicted of a crime and sentenced to death. The High Court had acquitted the appellant, and the prosecution was directed for reinvestigation by a different investigation agency.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case revolve around the application of Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India, which deals with the protection against self-incrimination. The court discussed the three conditions laid down in T.P. Gopalakrishnan (supra) to determine whether the principle applies:

1. Previous proceedings must have been before a court of law or a judicial tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
2. The conviction or acquittal in the previous proceeding must be in force at the time of the second proceeding in relation to the same offence and the same set of facts.
3. The subsequent proceeding must be a fresh proceeding where the person is sought to be prosecuted and punished for the same offence and the same set of facts.

The court also discussed the principles of double jeopardy, innocence until proven guilty, and the importance of not displacing an acquittal in any circumstances except as provided by law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There are no explicit observations made by the court in this case. The text appears to be a summary of the judgment and discussion on applicable laws.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, holding that the right enshrined in Article 20(2) of the appellant stands violated due to the reinvestigation by a different investigation agency. The court quashed and set aside all proceedings subsequent to the direction for reinvestigation and acquitted the appellant of all charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The writ petition was filed by a group of persons with disabilities (PwDs) against the Respondent No.1, an examination conducting body, for not providing reasonable accommodations during examinations.
The petitioners contended that the guidelines issued by the Respondent No.5, the nodal agency, which provide for reasonable accommodations to PwDs during examinations, were not being enforced by the Respondent No.1.
The petitioners also relied on the judgments in Vikash Kumar and Avni Prakash, which emphasized the importance of providing reasonable accommodations to PwDs under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act, 2016).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the Respondent No.1 was obligated to provide reasonable accommodations to PwDs during examinations under Article 19 and 21 of the Constitution, which guarantee the right to equality and life with dignity.
They contended that the guidelines issued by the Respondent No.5 were clear and specific on providing reasonable accommodations to PwDs, but were not being enforced by the Respondent No.1.
The petitioners also argued that the lack of accountability and enforcement mechanisms was leading to a denial of rights to PwDs under the RPwD Act, 2016.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the guidelines issued by the Respondent No.5 were not being enforced by the Respondent No.1, resulting in a denial of rights to PwDs during examinations.
The court also noted that there was a lack of accountability and enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure compliance with the guidelines.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the Respondent No.5 to revisit the Office Memorandum dated 10.08.2022, remove the restrictions, and grant relaxations to PwDs during examinations in a reasonable manner.
The court also directed the Respondent No.1 to uniformly follow the guidelines issued by the Respondent No.5 and ensure strict adherence through periodic surveys/verification.
Additionally, the court ordered the setting up of a grievance redressal portal to register complaints, providing necessary training to scribes, and extending the validity of the scribe certificate.
The court emphasized the importance of providing reasonable accommodations to PwDs under the RPwD Act, 2016, and directed the Respondent No.5 to ensure strict compliance with the letter and spirit of the judgments in Vikash Kumar and Avni Prakash.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal by the Appellant, who was convicted and sentenced for a crime. The Appellant's bail bonds are to be cancelled if he is on bail, and he is directed to surrender and undergo the remainder of the sentence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution presented evidence that supported their case, including statements from eyewitnesses and medical reports. The Investigating Officer recorded the statement of the deceased instantly, a day after the incident, and it was clear that the declarant Tularam was in a fit condition as he properly explained the incident and specified the role of the Appellant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The mere non-obtainment of a medical fitness certificate will not deter the consideration of a properly recorded statement under Section 161 CrPC to be a dying declaration. The Constitution Bench in Laxman v. State of Maharashtra has authoritatively ruled that where eyewitnesses state that the deceased was in a fit and conscious state to make the declaration, the medical opinion will not prevail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concluded that there are no contradictions or discrepancies in the prosecution case of such a nature that would compel them to take a view different than that of the Trial Court and the High Court. The appeal is dismissed, and if the Appellant is on bail, his bail bonds are cancelled, and he is directed to surrender and undergo the remainder of the sentence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two appeals (Bail Application Nos. 1557 and 1559 of 2024) filed by an appellant against the order dated 21st May 2024 passed by the High Court of Delhi, quashing the bail granted to the appellant in ED Case No. HIU-II/14/2022 registered against him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and FIR No. RC0032022A0053 of 2022 registered against him by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The case involves 493 witnesses, thousands of pages of documents, and over a lakh pages of digitized documents.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are:
* The appellant's right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution is being infringed upon by his prolonged incarceration.
* There is no possibility of the trial being concluded in the near future, given the number of witnesses and documents involved.
* Keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period would be a violation of his fundamental rights.
* The objective of keeping a person in judicial custody pending trial or disposal of an appeal is to secure their attendance at trial, not as punishment.
* Conditions can be imposed on the appellant to ensure he does not flee and is available for facing trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are:
* The principle that bail is a rule and refusal is an exception is often followed in breach.
* Non-grant of bail even in straightforward cases results in a huge number of bail petitions, adding to the pendency.
* It is high time for trial courts and High Courts to recognize that "bail is a rule and jail is an exception".
* The prolonged incarceration of the appellant would deprive his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court is:
* The appeals are allowed, and the impugned judgment and order dated 21st May 2024 are quashed and set aside.
* The appellant is directed to be released on bail in connection with ED Case No. HIU-II/14/2022 and FIR No. RC0032022A0053 of 2022 on furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- with two sureties of the like amount.
* The appellant is to surrender his passport with the Special Court.
* The appellant shall report to the Investigating Officer on every Monday and Thursday between 10-11 AM.
* The appellant shall not make any attempt either to influence the witnesses or to tamper with the evidence.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between Gopalkrishnan (the plaintiff) and Vasantha & Ors. (the defendants). The plaintiff claimed ownership of the suit property, while the defendants disputed this claim. The issue of limitation was raised by the defendants, stating that the plaintiff's remedy had barred due to the lapse of time. The plaintiff alleged that he had been in possession of the property until 1993 and later claimed that the defendants were in possession.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case include:
- The plaintiff argued that he was not aware of the limitation period and therefore should be allowed to file his claim despite its expiry.
- The defendants contended that the plaintiff's failure to assert his title within the stipulated time frame rendered him ineligible for relief.
- The appellate court noted that the lapse of limitation bars only the remedy, but does not extinguish the title, citing Section 27 of the Limitation Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case include:
- The Court noted that after the death of the life-estate holder in 2004, there was no attempt made by the original plaintiff to amend the plaint to seek the relief of recovery of possession.
- It was emphasized that amendment of a plaint can be made at any stage of a suit, even at the second appellate stage.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 29A(4) and Section 11 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act (A & C Act). The court is examining whether an application for extension of time period for passing an arbitral award under Section 29A(4) read with Section 29A(5) is maintainable even after the expiry of the twelve-month or the extended six-month period, as the case may be.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court presents various arguments and observations to justify its decision. The key points include:

* The court emphasizes that an interpretation which produces an unreasonable result should not be imputed to a statute if there is some other equally possible construction which is acceptable, practical, and pragmatic.
* The court highlights the legislative intent to effectuate efficiency and expediency in the arbitral process through provisions such as sub-sections (6) to (8) of Section 29A.
* The court also notes that an application for extension under sub-section (5) must be disposed of expeditiously, with the endeavour of doing so within sixty days from the date of filing.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The key observations made by the court include:

* The arbitral tribunal's mandate continues where an application under Section 29A(5) is pending, but the power to extend time period for making of the award vests with the court, and not with the arbitral tribunal.
* An interpretation which produces an unreasonable result should be avoided in favor of a more acceptable and pragmatic construction.
* The legislative intent underlying Sections 29A(6) to (8) is to effectuate efficiency and expediency in the arbitral process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that an application for extension of time period for passing an arbitral award under Section 29A(4) read with Section 29A(5) is maintainable even after the expiry of the twelve-month or the extended six-month period, as the case may be. The court will be guided by the principle of sufficient cause while adjudicating such extension applications.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a merger of two companies, HNGIL and AGI, and the objectors raised concerns about the impact on competition in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) conducted an investigation and concluded that the proposed combination would not have an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC) in the relevant market.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The objectors argued that the CCI's conclusion was incorrect, citing various factors such as the product outflow from the acquirer and target, installed capacity, and consented capacities. They also pointed out alleged errors in the CCI's calculation of AAEC.
The respondents (the companies involved) defended the CCI's decision, arguing that it had carefully considered all relevant factors and reached a correct conclusion.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court noted that an appeal under section 53T of the Competition Act is not a re-hearing of the facts but rather a review of whether there has been a patent error in the CCI's decision-making process. The court also observed that the data details need not be reconsidered, and findings need not be recorded on whether the proposed combination has AAEC in the relevant market in India.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals filed by the objectors, affirming the CCI's decision. The court relied on the conclusion of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which had upheld the CCI's findings that the proposed combination would not have an appreciable adverse effect on competition.
Justice Hrishikesh Roy, writing for the majority, noted that the consideration and conclusion recorded by the CCI were affirmed by NCLAT and should be given due weightage. Justice S.V.N. Bhatti wrote a separate opinion reaching a different conclusion but agreeing to the dismissal of the appeals.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and its minority status. The matter pertains to the interpretation of Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, which grants minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of the AMU's minority status:
- The university was established by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan in 1920 with the objective of providing education to Muslims, who were marginalized at that time.
- The British Indian Government had no objection to its establishment and even granted it recognition as a minority institution.
- The AMU has maintained its minority character over the years despite changes in government policies.

Arguments against the AMU's minority status:
- Article 30(1) of the Constitution requires that educational institutions be established or administered by persons belonging to a particular religious community.
- The court observed that since the AMU was established with public funds and is now recognized as a public institution, it cannot claim minority status.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made during the case:
- The judge noted that there were no rights, fundamental or otherwise, prior to the Constitution coming into force in 1950, making it impossible for the AMU to have "surrendered" any right.
- The court observed that Article 30 is not an absolute provision and has substantial interplay with other fundamental rights.
- It was also stated that the purpose of Article 30 is not to create 'minority only' ghettos but to provide positive rights to minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The reference is answered in the above terms. The matters may be placed before an appropriate bench as per the prevailing rules.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the respondents and the first appellant regarding the eviction of public premises. The High Court had framed points for determination by the Inquiry Officer, which were challenged by the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants include:
- The Inquiry Officer's bias and lack of independence as an officer of the first appellant
- The necessity to implead the State Government in the proceedings under section 105B of the Act
- The Inquiry Officer's incompetence to proceed with the inquiry in the absence of regulations having been framed under section 105H of the Act

The High Court had addressed these points, holding that:
- The Inquiry Officer is an independent quasi-judicial officer under the Act and not biased
- Impleading the State Government was superfluous as the subject premises belonged to the first appellant
- The absence of regulations does not entitle the respondents to keep the proceedings in abeyance
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had already rendered findings on the issues raised by the appellants, including the Inquiry Officer's independence and competence. The respondents' pleas based on technical grounds were deemed as losing utility in ensuring that public premises are made free of unauthorized occupants.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
- The High Court should not have entertained writ petitions that were not maintainable
- The inquiry proceedings can continue despite the absence of regulations under section 105H of the Act, as long as natural justice principles are adhered to
- The Inquiry Officer is directed to allow both parties to lead evidence and raise points in defense, except as determined by judicial orders previously. The officer should proceed to decide the claims independently and in consonance with principles of natural justice.

<START CASE>
<FUNCTS>
The appellant, a stockbroker, entered into an agreement with the respondents to buy and sell securities on their behalf. The respondents, however, failed to pay for the securities purchased, resulting in a loss of Rs. 1,18,48,069/- to the appellant. The dispute was referred to arbitration, and the arbitral tribunal awarded the amount to the appellant along with interest.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties are as follows:
- The respondents argued that the adjustment of accounts on 05.03.2001 was illegal and invalid without written authorization.
- The appellant contended that the adjustment of accounts was in accordance with the BSE Bye-laws and SEBI Guidelines.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations were made by the court:
- The arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction to exercise its powers over respondent no. 1 based on an oral contract.
- The High Court incorrectly exercised jurisdiction under Section 37 and reappreciated evidence.
- There was no written authorization required for the adjustment of accounts as per Bye-law 227(a) and SEBI Guidelines.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The arbitral award dated 26.02.2004 is upheld in its entirety.
- Respondent no. 1 is jointly and severally liable, along with respondent no. 2, to pay the appellant the arbitral sum of Rs. 1,18,48,069/- along with 9% interest p.a. from 01.05.2001 till date of repayment.
- The impugned order of the High Court is set aside.

</FINDINGS>

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a property dispute between two parties, with the first partition suit being one of the key documents in the matter. The Punjab Pre-emption (Repeal) Act, 1973, is also mentioned as relevant legislation. The matter has been ongoing for over two decades and has seen several court appearances.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court's observation that the first partition suit could not have been decreed by virtue of the Punjab Pre-emption (Repeal) Act, 1973, is contested. It is argued that this observation is in error as it relates to an earlier transaction from the 1930s and 1940s.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's discussion on pre-emption appears to be misplaced in the context of the first partition suit.
The matter has been ongoing for over two decades, with the litigant facing numerous problems after obtaining a decree.
Despite improvements in law and procedure, the problems faced by litigants remain unchanged from past centuries.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allows the appeals to the extent that the matter is remanded to the First Appellate Court for a fresh decision on the objections of the appellant. The concerned Court is requested to take all necessary steps for expeditious disposal of the case.
A copy of the judgment is directed to be forwarded to the learned Registrar General of the High Court, who shall ensure its passage to the concerned Court.
The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal proceeding against Naresh Aneja, one of the two accused individuals (along with R.K. Aneja), in relation to an FIR No. 1074 of 2019. The complaint was filed by another individual, who alleged that he was harassed and exploited by both Naresh and R.K. Aneja.
The case involves a complaint filed under sections 498A, 506, 323, 504, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Naresh and R.K. Aneja. The complainant alleged that he was subjected to harassment and exploitation by both accused individuals.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are based on various judgments of the Supreme Court of India, which state that the High Court is entitled to quash a proceeding if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed.
The court also relies on various precedents, including State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy, State of A.P. v. Aravapally Venkanna, Neeharika Infrastructure (P) Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, Sachin Garg v. State of U.P., and Vishal Noble Singh v. State of U.P.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include that the sum total of the circumstances, submissions, and documents on record do not point to Naresh Aneja having committed any offense against the complainant.
The court also notes that the impugned judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad passed in Application u/s 482 No. 18712 of 2020 is set aside, and the criminal proceedings arising out of FIR No. 1074 of 2019 are quashed qua Naresh Aneja.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court states that the appeal is allowed, and the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside. Ex consequenti, criminal proceedings arising out of FIR No. 1074 of 2019 are quashed qua Naresh Aneja.
The observations made by the court are restricted only to the present Appellant (Naresh Aneja), and no view whatsoever has been expressed in respect of R.K. Aneja, regarding whom the law will continue on its course.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the Appellant against his conviction and sentence. The incident occurred on a day when the Appellant was involved in a scuffle with another person, resulting in the death of one Tularam. The prosecution case relied heavily on the statement recorded by the Investigating Officer under Section 161 CrPC from the deceased, Tularam.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the Appellant's defense team likely argued against the admissibility of the statement recorded by the Investigating Officer under Section 161 CrPC as a dying declaration due to the lack of medical certification confirming Tularam's mental fitness.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the requirement for a doctor's certification is merely a matter of prudence and not mandatory. The Constitution Bench in Laxman v. State of Maharashtra ruled that if eyewitnesses assert the deceased was conscious and capable of making the declaration, medical opinion cannot override such affirmation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the mere non-obtainment of a medical fitness certificate will not deter it from considering a properly recorded statement under Section 161 CrPC to be a dying declaration. The Appellant's appeal was dismissed, and he was directed to surrender and undergo the remainder of his sentence if on bail, or complete the remainder of the sentence if already in custody.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant has been incarcerated for 15 months or more for the offence punishable under the PMLA. The trial of the scheduled offences and, consequently, the PMLA offence is not likely to be completed in three to four years or even more.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned SG relied upon decisions indicating that the appellant's influential position in the State may have resulted in a so-called compromise between the bribe givers and the bribe takers. Considering the apprehension of the appellant tampering with the evidence, stringent conditions must be imposed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The decision highlights the importance of a speedy trial as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court also observes that clean acquittal after long incarceration may amount to a violation of rights under Article 21 and give rise to a claim for compensation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the appellant shall be enlarged on bail till the final disposal of CC No. 9 of 2023 pending before the Principal Session Judge, Chennai, on the following conditions:

a. The appellant shall furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs.25,00,000/ (Rupees twenty-five lakhs only) with two sureties in the like amount;

b. The appellant shall not directly or indirectly attempt to contact or communicate with the prosecution witnesses and victims of the three scheduled offences in any manner.

c. The appellant shall mark his attendance every Monday and Friday between 11 am and 12 noon in the office of the Deputy Director, the Directorate of Enforcement at Chennai.

d. He shall also appear on the first Saturday of every calendar month before the investigating officers of the three scheduled offences;

e. Before the appellant is enlarged on bail, he shall surrender his passport to the Special Court under the PMLA at Chennai;

f. The appellant shall regularly and punctually remain present before the Courts dealing with scheduled offences as well as the Special Court and shall cooperate with the Courts for early disposal of cases.

g. If the appellant seeks adjournments on non-existing or frivolous grounds or creates hurdles in the early disposal of the cases mentioned above, the bail granted to him shall be liable to be cancelled.

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court treated the relief for possession as a consequential prayer and the relief for cancellation of Sale Deed as the substantive prayer. The limitation period was considered with respect to the substantive relief of cancellation of Sale Deed, which would be three years from the date of knowledge of the sale deed sought to be cancelled.
</OBSERVATIONS>

The case involves the appellant, who was charged with offenses under Sections 353 and 186 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in Case Crime No. 290 of 2015. The CJM, Varanasi, took cognizance of the offenses, and the appellant was issued a summons. The High Court initially declined to interfere, but this Court later allowed the appeal and quashed the criminal proceedings against the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

*   The CJM, Varanasi, did not follow due process while taking cognizance of the offenses under Sections 353 and 186 of the IPC.
*   The High Court's initial decision to decline interference was based on a prima facie view of the case, without considering the specific issues raised in the appeal.
*   The order dismissing the Special Leave Petition (SLP) in limine did not constitute a declaration of law or a binding precedent under Article 141 of the Constitution.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations were made during the case:

*   The High Court's decision was based on a prima facie view of the case, without considering the specific issues raised in the appeal.
*   The order dismissing the SLP in limine did not constitute a declaration of law or a binding precedent under Article 141 of the Constitution.

The case involves a husband (appellant) who had his passport impounded under Section 10 of the Passport Act, 1967. The appellant's wife filed a complaint against him and his family members under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Domestic Violence Act. The appellant then filed an application under Article 142(1) of the Constitution to dissolve their marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court referred to several precedents, including:
- Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P. (2018), which stated that impounding of passports or issuance of 'Red Corner Notice' should not be a routine for persons ordinarily residing out of India.
- The judgment in Rajiv Chaudhary v. U.K. (1997) 3 SCC 247, which held that the power under Article 142(1) can be exercised to grant divorce on irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
The court also noted the principles of natural justice and the importance of granting an opportunity to be heard before impounding a passport.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the act of impounding the appellant's passport was carried out without granting him an opportunity to be heard, which is a clear violation of the principles of natural justice. The court also noted that the judgment in Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P. emphasizes that impounding of passports or issuance of 'Red Corner Notice' should not be a routine for persons ordinarily residing out of India.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The judgments/orders dated 15th September, 2022 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Howrah and 25th January, 2023 passed by the High Court are quashed and set aside.
- The application filed by the appellant-husband under Article 142(1) of the Constitution is allowed, and the marriage between the appellant and the respondent is dissolved on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.

The case involves a complaint filed by the 4th respondent against the accused under the POCSO Act. The accused was a teacher in a higher secondary school and allegedly made pressure on the complainant not to lodge any report after an incident occurred.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court quashed the FIR and all further proceedings on the ground that the accused and the complainant had settled the matter. However, the Supreme Court disagreed with this decision, stating that the power under Section 482, Cr.P.C. cannot be used to quash proceedings based on compromise if it is in respect of heinous offences which are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the accused was making pressure on the complainant not to lodge any report, despite giving such a statement in the complaint. Within a couple of weeks, the accused managed to compromise the case with the 4th respondent and his wife. The court also noted that the POCSO Act has a specific object and purpose of deterring others from committing similar offences.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed the impugned order dated 04.02.2022 of the High Court, and set aside the decision to quash the FIR No.6/2022 and all further proceedings. The court directed that the FIR, investigation, and criminal proceedings be proceeded with against the accused in accordance with law.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a reference on the interpretation of Articles 105 and 194 of the Constitution, specifically regarding the immunity from prosecution for members of Parliament or State Legislatures.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of interpreting Articles 105 and 194 to grant immunity:
* The purpose of these articles is to sustain an environment where debate and deliberation can take place within the legislature without fear of prosecution for anything done or said in respect of his speech in, or statement made in, either House of Parliament or the State Legislature.
* Bribery is not essential to the casting of a vote or the ability to decide on how a vote should be cast.

Arguments against interpreting Articles 105 and 194 to grant immunity:
* The expressions "anything" and "any" must be read in the context of the accompanying expressions, which means that bribery is not immune.
* Corruption and bribery by members of the legislatures erode probity in public life.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court:
* The potential of misuse against individual members of the legislature is neither enhanced nor diminished by recognizing the jurisdiction of the court to prosecute a member of the legislature who is alleged to have indulged in an act of bribery.
* The offence of bribery crystallizes on the exchange of illegal gratification, regardless of whether the agreed action is performed or not.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Judgment of the Supreme Court:
* Articles 105 and 194 do not grant immunity to members of Parliament or State Legislatures from prosecution for bribery.
* The interpretation that bribery is immune under these articles results in a paradoxical outcome where a legislator who accepts a bribe but does not follow through with their actions can be prosecuted, while one who agrees to accept a bribe and then votes independently cannot.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal filed by the Claimant-Appellant against the impugned judgments passed by the Courts below, challenging the award dated 18th February 2003 of the learned Arbitrator.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the appeal include:
* The lower courts had failed to comply with the well-laid-out parameters and contours of both Section 34 and Section 37 of the A&C Act, resulting in an incorrect interpretation and application of the law.
* The learned Arbitrator's award was correct, and any challenge thereto has failed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:
* The concept of "sum" under Section 31(7) of the Act includes both principal and interest.
* The purpose of enacting this provision is to encourage early payment of the awarded sum and to discourage delay in execution of the award.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court states:
* The impugned judgments are required to be set aside due to non-compliance with the parameters and contours of both Section 34 and Section 37 of the A&C Act.
* The award dated 18th February 2003 of the learned Arbitrator is restored, as any challenge thereto has failed.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioner, a former Judge of the High Court, is seeking to have his pensionary payments recomputed after giving him the benefit of an addition of ten years of service. The petitioner had held judicial office for at least ten years within the meaning of Article 217(2)(a) and was also a member of the Bar for over fourteen years and eight months prior to his appointment as a Judge of the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioner are based on the judgment of this Court in Union of India vs Justice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg, which held that a member of the Bar is entitled to the addition of ten years of service by virtue of the provisions of Section 14A. The petitioner's counsel submitted that the addition of ten years of service should be applied for computing the pension of a member of the district judiciary who is appointed to the High Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that accepting the submission of the Union of India would discriminate against Judges of the High Court based on the source from which they are drawn. The court noted that any other interpretation would result in a plain discrimination between the Judges of the High Court based on the source from which they have been drawn.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the petition and directed that the pensionary payments due to the petitioner be recomputed after giving him the benefit of an addition of ten years of service. The court clarified that the maximum basic pension which is payable to a Judge of the High Court of Rs 13,50,000 per annum shall continue to apply to the petitioner. The difference in pensionary payments payable to the petitioner shall be computed with effect from the date of his retirement within a period of three months and the arrears that are due and payable in terms of the present order shall be paid over by 31 March 2025.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Writ Appeals Nos. 425/2016, 6/2017, and others filed by the appellants against the judgments of the Division Bench of the High Court in relation to the levy of penalty under Rule 19. The appeals were allowed, and the judgment of the Division Bench was set aside.
The substituted penalty under Rule 19 reduced the penalty from four times the duty to the value of the duty. The appellants had challenged the imposition of a higher penalty under the old rule.
The case involved multiple Writ Appeals filed by the appellants against the judgments of the Division Bench, which were allowed and set aside by the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The single Judge held that the amendment by substitution had the effect of repealing the law existing as on the date of repeal. However, this approach was considered limited by the Supreme Court.
The Division Bench held that levy of penalty is substantive law and cannot operate retrospectively. This approach was also rejected by the Supreme Court.
The appellants argued that the substituted penalty only mollified the rigour of the law by reducing the penalty from four times the duty to the value of the duty, and therefore, the bar of Article 20(1) did not apply.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the single Judge's approach was limited, and the Division Bench's approach was incorrect. The court underscored the importance of a simple and plain understanding of laws and its processes, keeping in mind the purpose and object for which they seek to govern and regulate.
The Supreme Court also noted that the substituted Rule 19 operated retroactively and thus saved it from arbitrarily classifying offenders into two categories with no purpose to subserve.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the judgment of the Division Bench, and held that the penalty to be imposed on the appellants would be based on Rule 19 as substituted on 29.03.2011. There was no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a District Town Planner who was accused of carrying out a demolition during the course of performance of their official duties. The demolition was ordered by superior officers, and there was a correlation between the act of demolition and the discharge of official duty. An application for regularization of the construction put up by the first respondent was also pending at the time of the demolition. A complaint was filed against the District Town Planner under Section 197 of the CrPC, but no prior order of sanction was obtained.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the context and the outcome of the case, it can be inferred that the defense argued that the District Town Planner was carrying out their official duties at the time of the demolition and that there was sufficient basis for doing so. The prosecution likely argued that the District Town Planner acted outside the scope of their authority by demolishing the construction without prior order or sanction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the first respondent ought to have sought sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of the CrPC in this case. Since no prior order of sanction was obtained, the initiation of the criminal proceeding against the District Town Planner was vitiated. The summoning order and subsequent steps taken by the trial court are liable to be quashed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and disposed of it in the following terms: "Consequently, the summoning order and the consequent steps taken by the Trial Court pursuant to the said summoning order are liable to be quashed and are thus quashed. Insofar as the very initiation of the complaint is concerned, we observe that since there was no prior order of sanction passed under Section 197 of the CrPC, the initiation of the complaint itself, is non est."
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation and evolution of Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. by various decisions of the Supreme Court. The facts mentioned in the given text are about a recent pronouncement of this Court in the case of Babu Venkatesh v. The State Of Karnataka, where it was held that applications under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C. are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the complainant who seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case focus on the procedural practices and safeguards introduced by judicial decisions aimed at curbing the misuse of invocation of powers of a Magistrate by unscrupulous litigants for achieving ulterior motives. The BNSS has affixed greater accountability on the police officer responsible for registering FIRs under Section 173, ensuring that the Magistrate applies his mind judicially while considering both the complaint and the submissions of the police officer.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by this Court are as follows:
- The applications under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C. are filed in a routine manner without taking any responsibility only to harass certain persons.
- Prior to the filing of a petition under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C., there have to be applications under Sections 154(1) and 154(3)Cr.P.C.
- The requirement of filing an affidavit deters people from making false affidavits, thus preventing them from casually invoking the authority of the Magistrate.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal succeeds, and the impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. The order passed by the Magistrate directing police investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. is also set aside.
Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.

The BNSS has merely codified the procedural practices and safeguards which have been introduced by judicial decisions aimed at curbing the misuse of invocation of powers of a Magistrate by unscrupulous litigants for achieving ulterior motives.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an application seeking leave to file a replication in an election petition. The election petitioner alleged that the returned candidate had stated new facts in his written statement, requiring a reply. The High Court was asked to grant leave to file a replication to meet these explanations.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the election petitioner argued that the returned candidate's written statement contained new facts that required a reply, and therefore, leave to file a replication should be granted.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the court highlight the purpose of a replication. The court noted that the replication only sought to meet the explanations provided in the written statement and did not introduce any new material facts or causes of action. The court observed that this was within its discretionary jurisdiction.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states that leave to file a replication was justified, as it only sought to explain the averments made in the written statement. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that there was no merit in it and making no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the State Financial Corporations (SFCS) and their right to recover loans through specific Acts, such as the Haryana Revenue Recovery Act. The SFCS claim that they have an additional right to recover amounts due under these Acts, notwithstanding other rights, including the right to file a suit.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The State Financial Corporations (SFCS) assert their right to recover loans through specific Acts, such as the Haryana Revenue Recovery Act.
* The SFCS claim that these Acts confer an additional right to recover amounts due, notwithstanding other rights, including the right to file a suit.
* Several judgments and cases are cited in support of this argument, including V.R. Kalliyanikutty v. Kerala State Financial Corporation and Deep Chand v. Union of India.
* The opposing view is presented by the debtor, who argues that the right to recover loans through these Acts does not supersede their other rights, such as the right to file a suit for refund under protest (Section 70(3) of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations from the case include:

* The object of the specific Acts mentioned is to enable speedy recovery of money.
* These Acts do not supersede other rights, including the right to file a suit.
* Statute of limitation only bars a remedy, while the right to recover the loan through 'any other suitable manner provided' remains untouched.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:

* The matter needs to be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate three-judge bench for comprehensive consideration and authoritative pronouncement.
* The papers along with this order should be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for seeking appropriate directions from His Lordship.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a SEZ developer that has been granted the status of a deemed licensee. The developer is required to comply with certain regulations, including rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules and regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations. However, the developer argues that it is exempt from complying with these regulations as it is a deemed licensee.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant (SEZ developer) argued that:
- Being a SEZ developer in terms of the 2010 Notification does not automatically confer the status of a deemed licensee without scrutiny and application.
- The condition stipulated in rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules is unjustified and contrary to the statutory scheme.
The respondent (TSERC) relied on regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations to enforce the applicability of regulation 12, and also argued that the term 'general conditions' in regulation 49 pertains exclusively to the general conditions outlined in Chapter-4.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The language of regulation 12 merits careful scrutiny, as it states that an applicant shall comply with the provisions of the 2005 Rules, but the appellant is not a regular applicant but a deemed distribution licensee.
- Regulation 49 of the 2013 Regulations specifies that "these general conditions shall apply to distribution licensees and to all deemed distribution licensees", which does not include regulation 12 within its scope.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- Being a SEZ developer in terms of the 2010 Notification does not automatically confer the status of a deemed licensee without scrutiny and application.
- The condition stipulated in rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules is unjustified and contrary to the statutory scheme.
Therefore, the recognition of the status of a deemed distribution licensee cannot hinge on compliance with rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules read with regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations. The order of the TSERC granting the status of a deemed licensee to the appellant is modified to exclude the condition that its promoters infuse additional capital.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a charge-sheet submitted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against certain respondents under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The charges include alleged involvement in terrorist activities. The respondents had filed an application for bail, which was granted by the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The NIA argued that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the accusations against the respondents were prima facie true and that the mandate contained in the proviso to Section 43(D)(5) of UAPA would be applicable for not releasing them on bail. The High Court's order granting bail was challenged by the NIA, arguing that it was illegal and perverse.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that national security is a matter of paramount importance and that any act in aid to terrorist activities must be restricted. It noted that the UAPA has been enacted to prevent certain unlawful activities and deal with terrorist activities while imposing reasonable restrictions on civil liberties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order granting bail to the respondents, directing them to surrender themselves before the NIA. The court ordered that the Special Court proceed with the trial as expeditiously as possible without being influenced by any of the observations made in this order.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute regarding the reporting conditions in certain cases. The parties involved are not specified, and the context is that of legal proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
There is no clear indication of specific arguments presented by either party. However, the text does mention various court cases (listed in the "CASES" section) where different courts have held that reporting conditions are either directory or not illegal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the judges in this case are as follows:
- The court mentions a list of 22 cases where different courts have held that reporting conditions are either directory or not illegal. 
- Another list of 21 cases is mentioned, where various courts have held that reporting conditions are illegal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in this case appears to be a collection of previous court decisions on the matter, rather than an original ruling by the current court. The text does not specify any new law or precedent established in this particular case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the issue of jurisdiction to issue show cause notices under Section 28. The Commissioner of Customs challenged the orders of the High Court of Delhi in Mangali Impex (supra) and preferred review petitions before the Supreme Court.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments were presented on the jurisdiction of the proper officer to issue show cause notices under Section 28, with the Commissioner of Customs contending that the High Court had erred in holding that only the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) had the power to issue such notices. The Commissioner argued that the CBIC's powers were not exclusive and that other officers could also issue show cause notices.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court of Delhi in Mangali Impex (supra) had erred in its decision, upholding the view taken by the High Court of Bombay in Sunil Gupta (supra). The court also held that Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 was constitutionally valid.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the review petitions and set aside the decision of the High Court of Delhi in Mangali Impex (supra), upholding the view taken by the High Court of Bombay in Sunil Gupta (supra). The court also upheld the constitutional validity of Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022. The registry was directed to list the connected civil appeals and writ petitions before the appropriate bench.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a SEZ developer who has been granted the status of a deemed distribution licensee. The developer is required to comply with certain rules and regulations, but there is a dispute over whether they must also adhere to specific provisions in the 2005 Rules.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
TSERC argued that the developer should comply with regulation 12, which requires applicants to comply with the 2005 Rules. However, the developer contended that as a deemed distribution licensee, they are exempt from complying with regulations 4-11 and thus do not need to adhere to regulation 12.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the language of regulation 12 is clear in stating that applicants who come within the purview of regulations 4-11 must comply. Since the developer is a deemed distribution licensee, they fall outside the scope of these regulations and therefore do not need to comply with regulation 12.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concluded that the TSERC's reliance on regulation 49 was flawed and that the term 'general conditions' in this provision pertains exclusively to Chapter-4. Therefore, the recognition of the developer's status as a deemed distribution licensee cannot hinge on compliance with rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules read with regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations.

The court also set aside the judgments and orders of the TSERC and APTEL to this extent, but modified its order granting the status of a deemed licensee to the developer while excluding the condition that its promoters infuse an additional capital. The appeal was partly allowed in these terms.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the applicability of the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 to insurance policies. The appellant had attempted to purchase India Insurance Stamps from within the state but was unable to do so due to the lack of mechanism for payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability of insurance stamps.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* The Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 applies to the present case.
* The state legislature has the legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III.
* The rate prescribed by the Parliament under Entry 91 of List I is applicable for the collection of stamp duty on insurance policies.
* The appellant had no choice but to purchase the insurance stamps from outside the state due to the lack of mechanism for payment of stamp duty under the 1952 Act in case of unavailability of insurance stamps.

The High Court, while considering these arguments, held that:

* The Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 applies to the present case.
* The state legislature has the legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III.
* For the execution of insurance policies within the state of Rajasthan, the appellant is bound to purchase India Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state of Rajasthan.

However, the High Court's judgment was challenged by the parties, leading to the present appeal.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case are as follows:

* The High Court failed to consider sub-section (4) of Section 3A despite quoting it, which excludes instruments under Entry 91, List I from the application of Section 3A.
* The state government's demand for stamp duty as per the orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004 was upheld by the High Court.

However, these observations were later set aside by the Supreme Court in its judgment.

</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

* The Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 applies to the present case.
* The state legislature has the legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III.
* For the execution of insurance policies within the state of Rajasthan, the appellant is bound to purchase India Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state of Rajasthan.

However, in view of the specific facts and circumstances of the case, the Supreme Court directed that:

* The state government shall not demand and collect the stamp duty as per the orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004.

The appeals were dismissed by the Supreme Court, and it affirmed the judgment of the High Court in D.B. Civil Special Appeal (Writ) No. 670 of 2004, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3418 of 2006, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3419 of 2006, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3420 of 2006 and D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 8187 of 2004.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the judgment of a Special Judge, NIA, in which the trial court did not take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 120-B of the RPC, 1989. The complaint was conveyed by the District Magistrate, Ramban to the Special Judge on 20.09.2019, and the investigation stood completed with the filing of a chargesheet on 25.09.2019. The appointed day for the Act, 2019 was 31.10.2019.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's submission that there is no need to get the appropriate sanction or empowerment as mandated under Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 cannot be countenanced. The respondent (Special Judge) had failed to exercise their power in granting an authorization for conveying a complaint at the conclusion of investigation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that while an investigation could continue after its initiation under the CrPC, 1989, by way of the application of the CrPC, 1973, it cannot be stated that even for a case where there was a clear non-compliance of the former, it can be ignored by the application of the latter. Para 2(13) confers sufficient power on the investigating agency to deal with such situations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed in part. The court sets aside the impugned judgment and gives liberty to the appellant to comply with the mandate of Section 196-A of the CrPC, 1989 by seeking appropriate authorization or empowerment as the case may be. If such compliance is duly made, then the Trial Court shall undertake the exercise of taking cognizance and proceed further with the trial in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves four accused persons, Waseem, Nazim, Aslam, and Abubakar, who are charged with a double murder. They have been in custody for less than three years. A cross-FIR was filed by the mother of one of the accused persons, Smt. Saeeda Begum, but it has been pending due to a protest petition filed by the complainant. The appellant in the case has also moved an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C against the complainant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented are that despite being charged with a serious offence of double murder, the accused persons have remained in custody for less than three years, which is a short period. The court is expected to consider whether granting bail at this stage would be appropriate given the circumstances. The prosecution has also highlighted the seriousness of the crime and the need for the accused to face trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are that all the factors collectively indicate that the respondents do not deserve the concession of bail. The court notes that the accused persons have filed a cross-complaint, but the affidavit supporting it has been denied by the affiants. The protest petition and the application under Section 340 Cr.P.C against the complainant are also pending.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is to quash and set aside all the four impugned orders granting bail to the accused persons. The respondents are directed to surrender within two weeks from the date of passing of this order. The observations made above are limited to examining the infirmities in the impugned orders and shall not be treated as an opinion on the merits of the matter which is still pending trial.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the quashing of an FIR (First Information Report) under the Uttar Pradesh Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. The appellants were allegedly involved in a gang-related activity, but the complainant(s)/informant(s) had already resorted to their remedies under criminal law by lodging three CCs (Crime Cases). A fourth CC was also lodged against the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The FIR should be quashed as the State's action seems premature and uncalled for, given that the complainant(s)/informant(s) had already resorted to their remedies under criminal law.
- Assuming all allegations are correct, there is no mention of any instance where the appellants implemented or acted on the alleged threats post-registration of the CCs.
- The State's resort to the Act seems unnecessary, given that the complainant(s)/informant(s) have also resorted to civil proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- The overall picture emerging from the facts suggests that resorting to the Act by the State was premature and uncalled for.
- Despite the allegations, there is no instance where the appellants implemented or acted on the alleged threats post-registration of the CCs.
- The complainant(s)/informant(s) had already resorted to their remedies under criminal law, which suggests that the State's action may not be justified.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is as follows:
- The FIR (CC No.0092/2023) is quashed.
- The impugned judgment stands set aside.
- Proceedings consequential to CC No.0092/2023 stand effaced.
- Observations made hereinabove are only on the issues arising and are not definitive re pending CCs, which shall be dealt with on their own merits by the courts concerned.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order granting bail to a respondent in a specific case. The respondent is also accused in three other cases, but has been acquitted or enlarged on bail in those cases. The appellant-state did not seek cancellation of the bail till date and there are no other overwhelming materials on record to set aside the order granting bail.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the Additional Solicitor General of India include that the respondent is involved in three other cases and should be denied bail. However, it was contended by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent that the respondent has been acquitted or enlarged on bail in those cases. The court also considered the fact that the appellant-state did not seek cancellation of the bail till date.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The prosecution would be at liberty to seek for cancellation of the bail in the event any of the conditions being violated by the respondent. The jurisdictional court shall proceed to adjudicate the case on merits after trial, without being influenced by the observations made under the impugned order.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal stands dismissed. The court observed that interference is not warranted in this case and there are no grounds to set aside the order granting bail. However, the prosecution would be free to seek cancellation of the bail if any conditions are violated.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the termination of two female judicial officers, Sarita Chaudhary and Aditi Kumar Sharma, by the High Court. The petitioners claimed that their termination was unjustified and based on indirect discrimination.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had erred in acting agnostic to claims of insubordination of petitioner-Sarita Chaudhary and acute medical and emotional conditions battled by petitioner-Aditi Kumar Sharma. The petitioners argued that the termination orders were arbitrary and based on discriminatory practices.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that despite the growing number of female judicial officers, they still face a sensitive work environment and lack of guidance. The High Court's decision to terminate the petitioners was deemed unjustified, and their complaints were kept in abeyance due to their termination.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court set aside the termination orders and reinstated the petitioners in their service with all consequential benefits. The respondents were directed to declare the petitioners' probation as on the date their juniors were confirmed, and they shall not be entitled to any salary from the date of termination till their reinstatement.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Supreme Court of India was hearing a case related to the pendency of execution petitions in various High Courts across the country. The court was concerned about the delay in disposing of these cases and its impact on the decree holders.
The court also mentioned that it had previously issued directions to ensure that all execution proceedings were completed within six months from the date of filing, but these directions seemed to have been ignored by the lower courts.
Additionally, the court noted that there was a need for regular training of court personnel to improve their efficiency in handling execution cases.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the petitioners (decree holders) were arguing for a speedy disposal of their cases and a vacation of vacant and peaceful possession of the suit properties.
Similarly, the respondents (lower courts and High Courts) may have argued against the court's directions to expedite the execution proceedings, citing reasons such as lack of resources or personnel.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court made several observations in this case:
- The mandatory direction contained in Para 42.12 of Rahul S. Shah (supra) requiring the execution proceedings to be completed within six months from the date of filing has been reiterated by the court.
- The court noted that this direction had previously been mentioned in Bhoj Raj Garg v. Goyal Education and Welfare Society & Ors., Special Leave Petition (C) Nos. 19654 of 2022.
- The court expressed concern about the delay in disposing of execution petitions, which was affecting the decree holders.
- The court observed that there was a need for regular training of court personnel to improve their efficiency in handling execution cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court's judgment in this case is as follows:
- The appeals were allowed and the impugned judgments passed by the High Courts were set aside.
- The order passed by the Executing Courts was also set aside.
- The Executing Courts were directed to ensure that vacant and peaceful possession of the suit properties was handed over to the decree holders within a period of two months from today, without fail.
- All High Courts across the country were directed to call for information regarding the pendency of execution petitions in their respective districts and report compliance to the Registry of the Supreme Court within a specified timeframe.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal related to the procedure prescribed under Section 52A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. The facts are not explicitly stated in the given text, but it can be inferred that the case pertains to a trial involving alleged possession or trafficking of illicit substances.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved in the appeal are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the observations and judgment, it can be inferred that the defense argued for procedural irregularities in the collection and presentation of evidence under Section 52A of the NDPS Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Several key points were observed by the court:

* The procedure prescribed by Section 52A of the NDPS Act is intended to guide officers and ensure a fair process during investigations.
* Non-compliance with this procedure may not be fatal to the trial unless discrepancies in physical evidence render the prosecution's case doubtful.
* The court can proceed to convict an accused even if there are procedural defects under Section 52A, as long as other material on record inspires confidence regarding recovery and conscious possession of contraband.
* Non-compliance or delayed compliance with the provision may lead to drawing an adverse inference against the prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal, stating that:

* The initial burden lies on the accused to lay foundational facts indicating non-compliance with Section 52A of the NDPS Act, which only requires a preponderance of probabilities.
* Once these facts are laid, the onus shifts to the prosecution to prove by cogent evidence either substantial compliance with Section 52A or that such non-compliance does not affect its case against the accused, requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt.

The court also noted that pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the murder of two individuals, Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar Sahu. The trial court convicted Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) under Sections 302 and 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC. However, the High Court acquitted them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution relied on several pieces of evidence, including statements from witnesses and forensic reports. The defense argued that there was insufficient evidence to prove their clients' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the charge of conspiracy (Section 34) was not substantiated, and therefore, it could not be proved against Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), and Rajan Tiwari (A-9).
The court also noted that the trial court had imposed default punishment, but it was not specified in the judgment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court partially allowed the appeals of Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8), setting aside the acquittal by the High Court. The court affirmed their conviction under Sections 302 and 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC and restored their sentence.
The Supreme Court directed Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8) to undergo imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs. 20,000/- each under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC and rigorous imprisonment for five years with a fine of Rs. 20,000/- each under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
The court also directed them to surrender within two weeks from today to serve the remainder of their respective sentences.
The appeals were partially allowed, upholding the acquittal of Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan Singh (A-3), Ram Niranjan Chaudhary (A-6), and Rajan Tiwari (A-9) due to lack of sufficient evidence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The original plaintiff instituted a suit against the defendant company. The defendant company was declared a sick company under the 1985 Act and was under the supervision of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). The BIFR proceedings were pending from 1992 to 2013. The original plaintiff claimed interest on its dues at 24% per annum as per the provisions of the 1993 Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The original plaintiff argued that the suit was not hit by the embargo under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act, and therefore, the decree awarded in favor of the original plaintiff by the trial court and modified by the High Court could not be said to be coram non-judice. The original plaintiff also argued that the period during which the defendant company was a sick company should be excluded for the purposes of calculation of interest.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court held that the suit instituted by the original plaintiff was not hit by the embargo under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. The court also observed that the period during which the defendant company was a sick company should be excluded for the purposes of calculation of interest.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment and order were upheld subject to the modification of the period for which interest may be granted as discussed above. The interest will be calculated at 24% p.a. with monthly compounding. The final amount that may be determined in accordance with the final decree shall be paid to the original plaintiff within a period of 4 weeks from today, failing which interest at the rate of 36% p.a. with monthly compounding shall accrue.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellant No.1 stood automatically disqualified as a Member since he failed to produce the Validity Certificate within 12 months from the date of his election.
The Appellant No.1 was contesting in an election and did not have a Validity Certificate on the date of nomination.
The District Caste Certificate Scrutiny Committee had disposed of the Appellant's application for non-compliance with Rule 17.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant No.1 argued that he should be protected under Section 3 of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023, which provides a protective umbrella for those who fail to produce the Validity Certificate within a certain timeframe.
However, it was contended by the Respondents that the Appellant's application was not pending on the date of commencement of the said Act and hence, he is hit by Section 3(2)(b) of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had set aside the rejection of the No Confidence Motion against Appellant No.2-Sarpanch, holding that the motion was duly carried.
The High Court directed that the Appellant No.2 should stop exercising the powers as a sarpanch and that the election for the post of village Sarpanch be notified afresh.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment and order of the High Court dated 20.09.2023 in Writ Petition No.7924 of 2023, dismissing the Appeal.
The Appellant No.1 stood automatically disqualified as a Member due to his failure to produce the Validity Certificate within 12 months from the date of his election.
The High Court's direction that the election for the post of village Sarpanch be notified afresh was upheld by the Supreme Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case deals with a state-legislation, the implementation of which lies with the State of Maharashtra. The statute in question was intended to benefit the marginalized and impoverished. There have been problems indicated in the working of the statute, as mentioned in Paragraph 34.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argues that the judiciary can perform a facilitative role in access to justice and effective functioning of constitutional bodies. This role does not involve reviewing executive and legislative actions but rather nudging and providing impetus for systemic reforms. The court believes that this is an essential component of constitutional justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the overwhelming majority of legislations in India are introduced and carried through by the government, with very few private member bills being introduced and debated. This makes it difficult for the intended beneficiaries to carry their voice to the legislative branch for effective reform.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court requests the Ld. Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court to constitute a bench to initiate suo motu proceedings for reviewing the working of the statute and identifying the cause of problems indicated in Paragraph 34. The concerned bench is asked to hear the government, statutory authorities, necessary stakeholders including intended beneficiaries, and perhaps take assistance from senior members of the bar as amici curae.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves cellular mobile service providers (assessees) who challenged the judgments of various High Courts regarding the applicability of Section 194-H of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The section requires deducting tax at source on payments made to distributors/franchisees for the income/profit component in such payments.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the assessees were that:
* They are not required to deduct tax at source under Section 194-H of the Income-tax Act, 1961 as they do not have control over the distributors/franchisees and do not have any fiduciary relationship with them.
* The distributors/franchisees are independent contractors who work for themselves and are not agents of the assessees.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The term 'agent' in Section 194-H of the Income-tax Act, 1961 should be restricted to one who has the power of affecting the legal position of his principal by making contracts or disposition of the principal's property.
* The relationship between the assessees and distributors/franchisees is that of an independent contractor and not a fiduciary relationship.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The assessees are not under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in payments received by distributors/franchisees from third parties/customers or while selling/transferring pre-paid coupons or starter-kits.
* Section 194-H of the Income-tax Act, 1961 is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case.
* The appeals filed by the assessees are allowed and the judgments of the High Courts of Delhi and Calcutta are set aside. The appeals filed by the Revenue challenging the judgments of High Courts of Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Bombay are dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellant had claimed 'Mochi' caste, and the Scrutiny Committee validated and granted the 'Mochi' caste certificate. The Appellant's claim was for 'Mochi' based on genealogical caste history of their forefathers. The Scrutiny Committee verified the claim holding that the Appellant belongs to 'Mochi' caste in accordance with Entry 11 of Presidential Order as applicable to Maharashtra.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court was criticized for undertaking an erroneous exercise of appreciating evidence in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The Scrutiny Committee's order did not merit any interference by the High Court in a 'writ of certiorari' under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The Presidential Order cannot be amended directly or indirectly, but the case did not call for any inquiry into a sub-caste nor does it amend the Presidential Order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Scrutiny Committee had followed the due procedure under Rule 12, 17 and 18 of the 2012 Rules. The High Court swayed itself into a roving inquiry which was not expected as per settled legal position. The Scrutiy Committee is an expert forum armed with fact-finding authority.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The instant appeals stand allowed, and the impugned judgment passed by the High Court stands set-aside. The validation order dated 03.11.2017 passed by the Scrutiny Committee is restored. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appointment of Assistant Professors in universities and colleges. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has framed a scheme for appointment on this post, which includes eligibility criteria, selection process, and marking system. Respondent 1, Brahma Deo, challenged the selection process and the marking system, specifically arguing that teaching experience was not given due weightage.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (UGC and others) argued that the selection process and marking system were in accordance with the UGC scheme. They contended that teaching experience was only one of the eligibility criteria and that other factors like post-doctoral experience, research publications, and academic credentials also carried significant weightage.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Division Bench of the High Court observed that the marking system for teaching experience did not provide sufficient weightage to candidates with higher teaching experience. However, this observation was made without seeking clarification from the UGC or the appellants on what constituted "post-doctoral experience" and how it was marked.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the impugned order of the Division Bench was unsustainable in law and deserved to be set aside. The court observed that the selection process and marking system were in accordance with the UGC scheme, which did not make teaching experience a sine qua non for direct recruitment. The court also noted that the Division Bench had erred in appreciating the contentious issues in the proper perspective vis-à-vis the law applicable thereto.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case pertains to land acquisition proceedings for the Yamuna Expressway project in Uttar Pradesh, India. The appeals were filed by both the landowners (Batch No. 1) and the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) (Batch No. 2). The landowners had challenged the invocation of the urgency clause under Sections 17(1) and 17(4) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the landowners argued against the invocation of the urgency clause, while YEIDA supported its use for the project's timely completion.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court in Kamal Sharma had granted an additional compensation of 64.7% to the landowners as a "No Litigation Bonus" in consonance with the Government order dated November 4, 2015. The Court noted that this was already a significant enhancement and no further increase was warranted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court of India dismissed the appeals filed by the landowners (Batch No. 1) and allowed the appeals filed by YEIDA (Batch No. 2). The Court held that the invocation of the urgency clause under Sections 17(1) and 17(4) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was justified in this case. Additionally, the Court directed that the 64.7% enhancement in compensation granted by the High Court would apply uniformly to all affected landowners, as per the Government order dated November 4, 2015.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the efficacy of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in Indian elections. The court is evaluating the reliability and trustworthiness of EVMs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments from the court:
- The use of EVMs has been previously raised before this Court, and it's imperative that the issue is concluded definitively now.
- Substantial evidence must be presented against the EVMs for any alternative to be considered.
- The current system with enhancements will persist unless substantial evidence is presented.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations from the court:
- Blindly distrusting any aspect of the system can breed unwarranted scepticism and impede progress.
- A critical yet constructive approach, guided by evidence and reason, should be followed to make room for meaningful improvements.
- The focus should be on building harmony and trust between all pillars of democracy through open dialogue, transparency in processes, and continuous improvement of the system.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balanced perspective when evaluating systems or institutions. It suggests that any attempt to revert to paper ballots or alternative systems without substantial evidence should be eschewed.

The court concludes with hope and trust that the current system will not fail the electorate, and the mandate of the voting public shall be truly reflected in the votes cast and counted.

A lawyer, Mr. P.Soma Sundaram, filed a second Special Leave Petition (Criminal) against the same order of the Hon'ble High Court of Madras dated 29.09.2023 in Criminal Appeal No. 618 of 2011 without disclosing this fact in his petition. 
The first Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Diary No. 5111/2024 was dismissed on 29.04.2024.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The lawyer apologized for the mistake and submitted that it was neither wilful nor wanton. He also submitted that he had mentioned the factum of filing the first Special Leave Petition (Criminal) in pages G, H, and I of the List of Dates and Events.
He prayed to this Hon'ble Court to accept his unconditional apology and render justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The apology was described as honest and genuine, coming from a penitent heart. 
Several eminent leaders of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), Office Bearers of the SCBA, and Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) appealed to this Court for mercy.
Suspending an Advocate -on-Record for a period of one month would cast a stigma on the future of the Advocate-on-Record. 
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Judge accepted the unconditional apology tendered by the lawyer, Mr. P.Soma Sundaram, and warned him to be careful in not repeating any such misconduct in future.
He also directed the lawyer to ensure that he shall appear before all cases where he has entered appearances.
The case was closed on 17th April, 2025.

<FACTS>
The case involves a selection process for 104 Constables in the Armed Forces (Paramilitary) Forces (AFPF). The appellants had undergone a recruitment process, but it was cancelled by the successor government. The appellants challenged this cancellation before the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants were:
* They did not have an indefeasible or vested right of appointment and could question any decision adverse to their interest affecting achievement of their goals to secure public employment.
* The selection process should be taken forward in accordance with law, and fresh advertisement should be published for filling up 104 Constables.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court were:
* The absence of grant of legitimacy to the select list by way of an approval from the Government did not infringe the respondents' legal rights.
* There were materials providing sufficient justification for the successor government to cancel the select list.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court was:
* The impugned judgments and orders of the High Court stood quashed.
* The civil appeal stood allowed, without order for costs.
* The appellants were granted liberty to take forward the process of filling up 104 Constables in the AFPF, in accordance with law, by publishing fresh advertisement.
* The respondents, if they chose to apply in pursuance of such advertisement, would be considered for appointment waiving their age bar as well as insignificant minor deficiencies in physical measurement and requirements of the PET.

The case involves an auction of a property under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The subject property is valued at ₹39,41,28,800/- in the first round of e-auction and ₹29,55,96,375/- in the second round. The difference between these two figures comes to approximately ₹10,00,00,000/-. The Auction Purchaser retained the balance sale consideration for over six months from 10th February, 2020.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the auction was conducted irregularly and that the Sale Deed should be declared void. However, the respondents maintained that the auction was conducted fairly and that the Sale Deed is valid. The court noted that repeated interferences in public auctions can cause uncertainty and frustrate the purpose of holding auctions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the appellants delayed preferring an appeal against the order passed by the Adjudicating Authority, which took 19 months to be filed. Additionally, the appellants resisted handing over possession of the subject property to the respondents, causing further delay. The court also noted that once an auction is confirmed, it should be interfered with on fairly limited grounds.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court partly allowed the appeals and directed the Auction Purchaser to pay an additional sum of ₹5,00,00,000/- (50% of the differential figure) along with interest @ 9 % p.a. reckoned from 26th March, 2020 till date of actual payment. The said amount is to be deposited by the Auction Purchaser with the Liquidator within eight weeks from the date of the order.

The Superintendent of Police issued an order on December 4, 2023, directing the registration of an FIR and authorizing a Deputy Superintendent of Police to conduct the investigation. The High Court of Karnataka quashed this order, citing violations of Section 17 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The appeal was filed against this judgment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
- The preliminary inquiry is not mandatory in every case under the PC Act.
- If a superior officer has detailed and well-reasoned source information, they can bypass the preliminary inquiry.
- Section 17 of the PC Act only restricts investigations, not the initial act of registering an FIR.
- The Superintendent of Police is competent to direct the registration of an FIR for cognizable offenses under the PC Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The High Court erred in imposing unwarranted administrative frameworks on law enforcement agencies.
- The order issued by the Superintendent of Police was compliant with the law and had due application of mind.
- The reasons assigned for entrusting the investigation to the Deputy Superintendent of Police were manifest and obvious.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The High Court's judgment was set aside, and the FIR in Crime No. 56 of 2003 was restored.
- The appeal was allowed, and the order dated December 4, 2023, issued by the Superintendent of Police was validated as being within the statutory framework of the CrPC and PC Act.

The case involves appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The High Court had passed an impugned judgment on July 7, 2023, which was challenged before the Supreme Court. The matter was listed for hearing before a roster Bench on August 11, 2023.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act were being treated as if they were appeals under Section 96 of the Civil Procedure Code. They contended that this was leading to a waste of time and resources, as multiple grounds not covered by law were being urged in petitions under Section 34.
The respondents argued that the appellants had failed to incorporate only relevant and permissible grounds in their petition under Section 37, resulting in unnecessary delay and expenditure.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act were not being conducted efficiently. The Court noted that the time of the Courts was precious, considering the huge pendency, and that the arbitral procedure needed to be made more effective.
The Court also observed that there was a tendency among members of the Bar to incorporate multiple grounds in petitions under Section 34, which were not legally permissible, resulting in waste of time and resources.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned judgment dated July 7, 2023, in Commercial Appeal No. 31 of 2023, and restored Commercial Appeal No. 30 of 2023 to the file of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
The Court directed that the restored appeal be placed before a roster Bench on July 29, 2024, at 10:30 a.m., and that the parties to the appeal be under an obligation to appear before the concerned Bench on that day.
The Court also permitted the appellants to file an amended memorandum of appeal containing only relevant and permissible grounds. The High Court was directed to fix a schedule for hearing of the appeal.
The interim relief granted by the Supreme Court on August 11, 2023, was continued to operate till the disposal of the remanded appeal.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of several accused individuals for various charges. The main facts include:
* A kidnapping incident where a boy named Sachin Garg was kidnapped.
* Several accused individuals were identified and arrested in connection with the incident.
* The prosecution presented evidence, including witness statements and recovered currency notes.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the accused individuals were involved in the kidnapping and had also committed other crimes. They presented evidence to support their claims, including:
* Witness statements from Sachin Garg and his father, which implicated several of the accused individuals.
* Recovered currency notes, which the prosecution claimed were recovered from the accused individuals.
* Disclosure statements made by some of the accused individuals, which the prosecution argued provided evidence of their involvement in the crime.

The defense argued that:
* The identification of the accused individuals was faulty and did not meet the required standards for a fair trial.
* The recovered currency notes were not properly handled or produced as evidence.
* The disclosure statements made by some of the accused individuals were not reliable or admissible.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* Several loopholes and shortcomings existed in the prosecution's case, including faulty identification, mishandling of evidence, and unreliable witness testimony.
* The defense had raised several valid points regarding the admissibility and reliability of certain evidence presented by the prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately ruled that:
* The prosecution's case was not strong enough to support a conviction, due to the numerous loopholes and shortcomings in their evidence.
* The accused individuals were acquitted of all charges.
* The bail bonds of the accused individuals were discharged.

The judgment also stated that:
* The entire story presented by the prosecution was "nothing but a piece of fabrication" and that the accused were "framed in the case for ulterior motive".
* There was no iota of truth in the prosecution's story, and the fabric of their case was full of holes.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the identification of forest areas and the criteria for their identification. The appellant, an NGO, challenged the existing criteria adopted by the Sawant and Karapurkar Committees for identifying private forests. The appellant proposed a new criterion of 0.1 density instead of the existing 5 ha with 0.1 canopy density.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the existing criteria were flawed and that the new criterion would help in accurately identifying forest areas. However, the respondent (Government) countered by stating that adopting the proposed criterion would lead to a reassessment of forest areas across the country, which had already been settled based on the existing criteria.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the appellant was attempting to approbate and reprobate by challenging the existing criteria while also relying on them in previous cases. The court also noted that the proposed criterion of 0.1 density would result in all plantations, including those grown by farmers on their private lands, being classified as forests.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court rejected the appeals and upheld the impugned order dated 30.07.2014. The court also vacated the interim order dated 04.02.2015 passed in I.A. No.3845 of 2015 in WP No.202 of 1995.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The assessees argued that they are not under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in the payments received by the distributors/franchisees from the third parties/customers, or while selling/transferring the pre-paid coupons or starter-kits.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that Section 194-H of the Act is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case. The relationship between the assessees and the distributors/franchisees is that of an independent contractor, who is free from control on the part of his employer.

The plaintiff had filed a suit for specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 26.04.1991 in the year 1993 itself.
The plaint in the said suit was rejected on 12.01.1998.
The plaintiff could have filed the second suit on or before 12.01.2001 as it got right to file the suit on 12.01.1998 on the rejection of the plaint in the earlier suit filed by it.
The limitation period expired in January, 2001 itself and the second suit was filed belatedly in the year 2007.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff's right to sue stood extinguished as the cause of action had faded and paled into oblivion beyond the prescribed period of limitation as per Article 113 to the Schedule to the Limitation Act.
Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code was invoked to reject the plaint in O.S No.49/2007 filed by the respondent herein even in the absence of any evidence being recorded on the issue of limitation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court followed the principle that bringing an action stops running of time for the purpose of that action only, as per Andrew McGee's Limitation Periods, 4th Edn., Sweet & Maxwell, chapter 2, para1.
The Indian law also follows the English law in this regard, as per James Skinner vs. Kunwar Naunihal Singh, ILR (1929) 51 All 367, (PC).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed by setting aside the impugned orders of the High Court and the trial court.
The plaint in O.S No.49/2007 filed by the respondent herein was rejected under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code, as being barred under Article 113 to the Schedule to the Limitation Act.

The Superintendent of Police issued a composite order directing the registration of the FIR and authorizing an officer to conduct an investigation. The High Court of Karnataka was challenged by this decision.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
- The preliminary inquiry is not mandatory in every case under the PC Act, as per the judgment. If a superior officer has a detailed and well-reasoned source information report that prima facie discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, the preliminary inquiry may be avoided.
- Section 17 of the PC Act relates specifically to the investigation process, not the initial act of registering the FIR, which relies on the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
- The Superintendent of Police is competent to direct the registration of an FIR if he has information about the commission of a cognizable offence punishable under the PC Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judgment holds that the order dated 4th December, 2023, issued by the Superintendent of Police was fully compliant with the law. The High Court erred in imposing unwarranted administrative frameworks that could potentially incapacitate law enforcement agencies.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the State procurers (BEC) and M.B. Power (Madhya Pradesh) Limited, which was awarded a contract to supply power at higher rates than quoted by SKS Power (L-5 bidder). The High Court issued a mandamus to the instrumentalities of the State to enter into a contract with MB Power, citing that the power/electricity would be procured at rates quoted by MB Power. However, this decision was harmful to public interest as it would have led to financial burden on the State and consumers.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:
* The BEC's decision-making process was in conformity with principles laid down by the Supreme Court from time to time.
* The rates quoted by SKS Power (L-5 bidder) were not market aligned, as concluded by the BEC and approved by the State Commission.
* Issuing a mandamus to enter into a contract with MB Power would be harmful to public interest, as it would lead to financial burden on the State and consumers.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case are:
* The Court observed that unless the decision-making process is vitiated by arbitrariness, mala fides, irrationality, it will not be permissible for the Court to interfere with the same.
* The decision-making process adopted by the BEC was in accordance with the law laid down by the Supreme Court, and therefore, should not have been interfered with by the learned APTEL or the High Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the case is:
* The appeals are allowed, and the impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan, Bench at Jaipur dated 20th September 2021 in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.14815 of 2020 is quashed and set aside.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants' shares were transferred to the State Government in 1973. The suit was instituted in 1978, and the valuation of Rs.70.50 per share was claimed initially. Later, the appellants sought an amendment increasing the valuation to Rs.874/- per share based on a private valuer's report. The amendment was allowed in 2001. Subsequently, the appellants accepted the valuation of Rs.640/- per share as determined by M/s Ray & Ray, which was also ordered by the High Court and affirmed by this Court. It is an admitted fact that the Respondent No. 1 agreed to pay a fair valuation for the shares to the appellants but is yet to make the payment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants claimed interest at 18% with quarterly rest or 15% with monthly rest, which was deemed unreasonable by the court. The court exercised its discretion to award reasonable interest considering the prolonged pendency of the dispute and substantial share amount involved in a commercial transaction. The court aimed to strike a balance between the parties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court recognized the discretion to award interest, whether pendente lite or post-decree, guided by equitable considerations. The rate and period of interest should not be applied mechanically or at an unreasonably high rate without any rationale. The court must ensure that while the claimant is fairly compensated, the award does not become punitive or unduly burdensome on the Judgement Debtor.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court awarded simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum from 8th July 1975, on the enhanced valuation of shares till the date of decree and interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of decree till the date of realisation. The interest shall be paid along with the amount due towards the enhanced value of the shares, after adjusting the amount already paid, to the appellants within a period of two months from today.

The case involves an insurance claim filed by the appellant against the respondent insurance company. The appellant's father had taken two policies with the respondent, and he passed away due to illness. The appellant claimed the insurance amount under both policies, but the respondent repudiated the claim on the grounds of suppression of material facts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:
- The respondent argued that the insured had fraudulently suppressed information about existing insurance policies with other companies while entering into the contracts with them.
- The appellant contended that there was no suppression of any material fact and that the respondent's repudiation of the claim was without basis or justification.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
- The court noted that the respondents failed to adequately prove the fact that the insured had fraudulently suppressed information about existing policies with other insurance companies.
- The court also observed that the respondent's attempt to annex documents in support of their claim before the State Commission was declined due to the presentation of unauthenticated documents.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the identification of forest areas in Goa, India. The appellant had challenged the criteria adopted by the Sawant and Karapurkar Committees for identifying private forests, including those under private ownership. The committees' reports were considered by the Tribunal and subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the existing criteria for identifying forest areas should be revised, specifically suggesting a change from 5 ha to 1 ha and from 0.1 density to 0.1 canopy cover. This would result in reclassifying plantations on private lands as 'private forests', necessitating government permission under the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 for even minor developments.
The appellant also took a contradictory stance, relying on the same criteria adopted by the Sawant and Karapurkar Committees to identify forests, including private ones, before the Tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
None
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court rejected the appeals, upholding the impugned order dated 30.07.2014 and vacating the interim order dated 04.02.2015 passed in I.A. No.3845 of 2015. The court observed that there can be no uniform criteria for identifying forest areas across the country and delegated the task to Expert Committees to be constituted by State Governments.
The Court also noted that adopting the proposed 0.1 density criteria would open a Pandora's box, necessitating reassessment of forest areas in all States, which had previously been settled based on existing criteria.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the investigation into the activities of Hindenburg Research and other entities that took short positions, allegedly causing losses to Indian investors. The petitioners sought various reliefs, including a transfer of the investigation to an SIT or CBI.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
- The petitioner relied on the OCCPR report to suggest that SEBI was lackadaisical in conducting the investigation. However, this reliance was rejected by the court as the report was not verified for authenticity.
- The petitioner also relied on a letter from the DRI, but this issue had already been settled by concurrent findings of DRI's Additional Director General, the CESTAT, and the court itself.
- The allegations of conflict of interest against members of the Expert Committee were unsubstantiated and rejected.
- SEBI was directed to complete two pending investigations expeditiously, preferably within three months.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Public interest jurisprudence under Article 32 of the Constitution has been expanded by the court to secure access to justice and provide ordinary citizens with opportunities to highlight legitimate causes. However, this tool can be counterproductive if petitions lack adequate research and rely on unverified material.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
- The court did not interfere with the outcome of the investigations by SEBI but directed them to take their investigations to a logical conclusion in accordance with the law.
- No transfer of investigation was warranted, as there were no extraordinary circumstances presented that would justify such action.
- The Union Government and SEBI are directed to constructively consider the suggestions of the Expert Committee's report and take any necessary actions to strengthen the regulatory framework, protect investors, and ensure orderly market functioning.
- SEBI and investigative agencies are tasked with probing whether the losses suffered by Indian investors due to Hindenburg Research and other entities involved any infraction of the law, and if so, suitable action should be taken.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an arbitration petition filed by the AMP Group against various respondents, including the SRG Group. The petition relates to a dispute arising from a Family Arrangement Agreement (FAA) between the parties. The FAA is linked to a share transfer agreement and involves several transactions, including the sale of shares in a company.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The AMP Group argued that the SRG Group was bound by the arbitration agreement under the FAA, despite its claim that it had not agreed to the contract or the arbitration clause. The petitioner contended that the SRG Group's participation in the negotiation and performance of the underlying contract should be examined in detail to determine whether it is a party to the arbitration agreement.
The petitioner also argued that the nomenclature of the agreement, referred to as the "Family Arrangement Agreement," was not determinative of its character. They relied on a Supreme Court decision (Sasan Power Ltd.) that held that the name given to an agreement does not preclude its character as an arbitration agreement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, it was limited in conducting a mini-trial and delving into contested or disputed questions of fact. The court noted that a dual test needed to be satisfied before the SRG Group could be compelled to participate in the arbitration proceedings.
The court also found force in the contention of the petitioner (AMP Group) that the determination of whether the SRG Group was bound by the arbitration agreement required a detailed examination of evidence, which would be best conducted by an arbitral tribunal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the petition and appointed Mr. Akil Kureshi as the sole arbitrator to act in the dispute. The fees of the arbitrator and other modalities were to be fixed in consultation with the parties. The court clarified that all rights and contentions of the parties would remain open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of arrest and detention under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The appellants, Ankush Jain and Vaibhav Jain, are accused of money laundering and were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the basis of a complaint filed under the PMLA. The ED alleged that the appellants had misrepresented facts to the Income Tax authorities regarding their investments in certain companies, which actually belonged to Mr. Satyendar Kumar Jain. The appellants made declarations under the Income Disclosure Scheme (IDS), which were later held to be void by the Authorities and the High Court.
The ED also relied on the chargesheet filed by the CBI, which showed that the appellants had laundered money through various transactions. The ED argued that the appellants had failed to satisfy them that they were not guilty of the alleged offences.

The case was heard by a bench comprising Justices Bela M. Trivedi and Pankaj Mittal. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments in this case are as follows:
- The ED argued that there is sufficient material collected by them to show that the appellants are prima facie guilty of the alleged offences.
- The ED relied on the chargesheet filed by the CBI, which showed that the appellants had laundered money through various transactions.
- The ED also pointed out that the declarations made by the appellants under the IDS were not accepted by the Income Tax authorities as they had misrepresented facts regarding their investments in certain companies.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations are made:
- The High Court found the appellants guilty of the alleged offences under the PMLA and prima facie held them liable for money laundering.
- The ED pointed out that the declarations made by the appellants under the IDS were not accepted by the Income Tax authorities as they had misrepresented facts regarding their investments in certain companies.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed all the appeals, holding that the appellants had miserably failed to satisfy them that there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are not guilty of the alleged offences. The court also observed that the declarations made by the appellants under the IDS were held to be void and therefore, could not be used as a defense.
The court further held that the ED had sufficient material to show that the appellants are prima facie guilty of the alleged offences.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute related to the efficacy of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in Indian elections. The issue was previously raised before the court, and the court is considering whether substantial evidence has been presented against EVMs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argues that there are concerns about the accuracy and reliability of EVMs, which can lead to irregularities in election results. They also argue that reverting to paper ballots or alternative systems would be more transparent and secure.
On the other hand, the respondents (likely the Election Commission of India) may argue that EVMs have been extensively tested and proven to be reliable, and that any concerns about their efficacy are unfounded.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that this issue has been raised before, but substantial evidence is required to justify changes to the current system. The court also observes that blindly distrusting aspects of the electoral system can hinder progress and undermine trust in democratic institutions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Honorable Justice Dipankar Datta delivers the judgment on April 26th, 2024. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balanced perspective when evaluating systems or institutions, and notes that a critical yet constructive approach is necessary to ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the electoral system.
Justice Datta concludes by expressing hope and trust that the current system will not fail the electorate and that the mandate of the voting public will be truly reflected in the votes cast and counted.

<FACTS>
The case involves cellular mobile service providers (assessees) and the issue of whether they are under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in payments received by distributors/franchisees from third parties/customers, or while selling/transferring pre-paid coupons or starter-kits to distributors.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The assessees argued that they are not under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in payments received by distributors/franchisees from third parties/customers, or while selling/transferring pre-paid coupons or starter-kits to distributors.
- The Revenue argued that Section 194-H of the Act is applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case, making it obligatory for the assessees to deduct tax at source.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The term 'agent' in Explanation (i) to Section 194-H of the Act denotes a relationship that is very different from that existing between a master and his servant, or between a principal and principal, or between an employer and his independent contractor.
- An independent contractor is free from control on the part of his employer, and is only subject to the terms of his contract. But an agent is not completely free from control, and the relationship to the extent of tasks entrusted by the principal to the agent are fiduciary.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The assessees would not be under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in payments received by the distributors/franchisees from the third parties/customers, or while selling/transferring the pre-paid coupons or starter-kits to the distributors.
- Section 194-H of the Act is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case.
- Accordingly, the appeals filed by the assessees-challenging the judgments of the High Courts of Delhi and Calcutta are allowed and these judgments are set aside. The appeals filed by the Revenue-challenging the judgments of High Courts of Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Bombay are dismissed.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an arbitral award made in favor of DAMEPL against a public utility. The Division Bench of the High Court set aside the award, holding that it suffered from the vice of perversity and patent illegality. However, the two-judge Bench of this Court interfered with the judgment of the Division Bench, restoring the arbitral award.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments in the case were:
* The petitioner contended that the arbitral award was patently illegal and had been set aside by the Division Bench of the High Court due to perversity and patent illegality.
* DAMEPL argued that the judgment of the Division Bench suffered from a misappreciation of law and fact, and that this Court should interfere with the decision under Article 136 of the Constitution.
* The petitioner relied on the decision in Rupa Hurra (supra) to argue that the curative jurisdiction of this Court was available to correct grave miscarriages of justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court include:
* The Division Bench applied the correct test in holding that the arbitral award suffered from perversity and patent illegality.
* This Court failed to justify its interference with the well-considered decision of the Division Bench of the High Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
* The decision of this Court has resulted in restoring a patently illegal award, causing a grave miscarriage of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Court is as follows:
* The Curative petitions are allowed, and the parties are restored to the position they were in before the pronouncement of the judgment of the Division Bench.
* The execution proceedings for enforcing the arbitral award must be discontinued, and the amounts deposited by the petitioner pursuant to the judgment of this Court shall be refunded.
* Any part of the awarded amount paid by the petitioner as a result of coercive action is liable to be restored in favor of the petitioner.
* The orders passed by the High Court in the course of the execution proceedings for enforcing the arbitral award are set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a dispute over the classification of an imported oil product under the Indian Customs Act. The appellants had imported the product, which was allegedly classified as "High Speed Diesel" (HSD) under the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) specifications IS 1460:2005. However, upon inspection, the customs authorities reclassified the product as not conforming to the BIS standards and imposed confiscation proceedings against the appellants.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The appellants argued that the product was indeed HSD and met all the requirements of the BIS specifications. They claimed that the testing facilities for all the parameters were not available, leading to inconclusive test results and expert opinions. The appellants contended that they should be given the benefit of doubt due to the inconclusive evidence.
The respondents (customs authorities) argued that the product did not conform to the BIS standards and was therefore liable for confiscation under the Customs Act.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observed that the genesis of the prolonged litigation lies in the non-availability of adequate facilities for testing all the parameters laid down by the customs authority. The court noted that such disputes could have been avoided had the testing facilities for all the parameters been available.
The court also observed that laying down specific parameters for classification of goods without ensuring necessary facilities for testing would be meaningless.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals by setting aside the impugned common judgment and order. The court directed the respondents to ensure that proper facilities are made available in the appropriate laboratories for undertaking tests for all the parameters or at least for those parameters which the Authorities consider are of essential character to satisfy the "most akin" test.
The court also directed the respondents to take necessary steps within a period of six months for proper testing in all the parameters in future.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the respondent-CBI and the appellants, related to a contract between two parties for the supply of coal. The appellants are accused of profiting from the sale of coal rejects in the open market. The CAG Audit Report is also mentioned as a basis for the criminal inquiry.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
- The respondent-CBI embarked on a roving and fishing inquiry based on the CAG Audit Report, without any justification to attribute criminal intent to them.
- The dispute was a civil matter premised on a contract between the parties, breach of which could lead to determination of the contract or lease deed.
- The clauses of the agreements governing the parties were misinterpreted by the respondent-CBI.
- The CAG Audit Report had not attained finality till date.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The respondent-CBI heavily banked on the observations made in the CAG Audit Report, which has not attained finality.
- The clauses of the agreements governing the parties were misinterpreted by the respondent-CBI.
- The entire edifice of criminality and conspiracy built by the respondent-CBI was based on an incorrect premise that the coal rejects had a commercial value.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The order on charge dated 24th December, 2021 and the order framing charges dated 3rd March, 2022 passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI qua the appellants before this Court are unsustainable and accordingly quashed and set aside.

The Appellant No.1 was elected as a member and stood automatically disqualified as a Member since he failed to produce the Validity Certificate within 12 months from the date of his election.
A no-confidence motion against Appellant No.2-Sarpanch, was moved in the village panchayat which was rejected by the Tahsildar due to lack of quorum.
The High Court set aside the rejection of the No Confidence Motion and held that the No Confidence Motion against Appellant No. 2-Sarpanch, was duly carried.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant No.1 argued that he should be entitled to the protective umbrella of Section 3 of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023 despite his failure to produce the Validity Certificate within 12 months from the date of his election.
The Respondents argued that since there was no valid application pending on the date of the commencement of the said Act, Appellant No.1 is hit by Section 3(2)(b).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed that the Appellant No.1 had taken the 'risk' of contesting the election by not having a Validity Certificate on the date of nomination.
The High Court observed that accepting the contention of the Appellant No.1 would amount to putting a premium on the concession given to a party who was taking the ‘risk’ of contesting the election by not having a Validity Certificate on the date of the nomination.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court held that the Appellant No.1 stood automatically disqualified as a Member since he failed to produce the Validity Certificate within 12 months from the date of his election.
The High Court was justified in setting aside the rejection of the No Confidence Motion and in holding that the No Confidence Motion against Appellant No. 2-Sarpanch, was duly carried.

The case involves cellular mobile service providers (assessee) who are challenging the judgments of various High Courts regarding their liability to deduct tax at source on payments received by distributors/franchisees from third parties/customers, or while selling/transferring pre-paid coupons or starter-kits.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The assessee argues that they would not be under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in the payments received by the distributors/franchisees from the third parties/customers, or while selling/transferring the pre-paid coupons or starter-kits. They claim that Section 194-H of the Act is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case.
The Revenue argues that the assessee should deduct tax at source on the payments received by distributors/franchisees from third parties/customers, or while selling/transferring pre-paid coupons or starter-kits.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The Court observes that the term 'agent' in Section 194-H of the Act is used in a restricted sense to denote a relationship that is very different from that existing between a master and his servant, or between a principal and principal, or between an employer and his independent contractor. The Court notes that an independent contractor who may incidentally affect the legal position of his principal in other ways does not qualify as an 'agent' under Section 194-H of the Act.
The Court also observes that the relationship between the assessee and the distributors/franchisees is akin to a master-servant or employer-employee relationship, where the distributor/franchisee acts on behalf of the assessee. However, this relationship does not qualify as an 'agency' under Section 194-H of the Act.
</Observations>

<Judgment>
The Court holds that the assessee would not be under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in the payments received by the distributors/franchisees from third parties/customers, or while selling/transferring pre-paid coupons or starter-kits. Section 194-H of the Act is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case.
The appeals filed by the assessee are allowed and the judgments of the High Courts of Delhi and Calcutta are set aside. The appeals filed by the Revenue challenging the judgments of High Courts of Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Bombay are dismissed.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are as follows:

* The landowners argued that the invocation of the urgency clause was illegal and that they should be entitled to higher compensation for their lands.
* YEIDA, on the other hand, contended that the invocation of the urgency clause was justified and that the compensation awarded by the High Court in the case of Kamal Sharma was reasonable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Some key observations made by the Supreme Court are as follows:

* The majority of landowners had accepted the escalated compensation granted by the High Court in Kamal Sharma, indicating that they were satisfied with the compensation awarded.
* In previous cases, such as Savitri Devi v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Sahara India Commercial Corporation Limited v. State of Uttar Pradesh, the Supreme Court had upheld the acquisition proceedings despite holding the invocation of the urgency clause to be illegal.

* The appeals filed by the landowners (Batch No. 1) were dismissed.
* The appeals filed by YEIDA (Batch No. 2) were allowed.

- The Trial Court had no authority to decree the suit against Samiullah in exercise of its power under Rule 10 of Order VIII, CPC.
- There is no reason to interfere with the judgment and order of the High Court under challenge.
- The decree signed by the Trial Court is not a formal expression of an adjudication/determination since there has been no adjudication/determination so as to conform to the requirements of a decree within the meaning of section 2(2), CPC.

- The Trial Court's order dated 5th August, 1991 does not reveal any adjudication leading to determination of the rights of the parties in relation to any of the matters in controversy in the suit.
- There is no decree at all in the eye of law.
- A decree that follows a judgment or an order (of the present nature) would be inexecutable in the eyes of law and execution thereof, if sought for, would be open to objection in an application under section 47, CPC.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involved the acquittal of accused appellants in a kidnapping and extortion case. The prosecution's story was found to be fabricated, with several loopholes and shortcomings in the evidence. The key facts include:
- The kidnapped boy, Sachin Garg, identified one of the accused, Gaurav Bhalla, from before.
- The names of the accused persons were not disclosed to the police until 20th April, 2003.
- The special report forwarded by the Investigating Officer did not mention the names of the accused.
- The currency notes recovered at the instance of the accused were handed back to the complainant without any order from the Court.
</Facts>

The prosecution's arguments included:
- The identification of the accused persons by Sachin Garg and his father.
- The disclosure statements made by the accused, which led to the recovery of currency notes.
- The fact that the accused were known to be involved in similar crimes.

However, the defense argued that:
- The identification of the accused was not free from doubt.
- The disclosure statements were not proved as per law.
- The recovery of currency notes was a sham exercise.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The observations made by the Court include:
- The prosecution's case was full of holes, which were impossible to mend.
- There was no iota of truth in the prosecution story.
- The accused were framed for ulterior motives.
- The Court drew adverse inferences against the prosecution for not examining key witnesses and for the shoddy investigation.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Court was:
- To acquit the accused appellants of all charges.
- To set aside the impugned judgments passed by the trial Court and the High Court.
- To discharge the bail bonds of the accused, who were on bail.

The Court observed that the entire story of the prosecution was a piece of fabrication, and there was no evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all manner of doubt. The judgment highlighted the importance of thorough investigation and the need for the prosecution to prove its case with reliable evidence.

The case involved a legal dispute related to the revocation of a Cancellation Decision made by the Tribunal. The Appellant sought the revocation of the decision, but their request was dismissed by the executing court without affording them an opportunity for a hearing. The High Court upheld this decision.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the Appellant's legal team argued against the Tribunal's decision and sought revocation of the Cancellation Decision.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Observations section highlights a critique of the High Court's decision. The judges express concern that the High Court failed to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution, which could have led to a more favorable outcome for the Appellant. They suggest that the High Court should have remanded the case back to the executing court to afford the Appellant an opportunity for a hearing.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The final judgment states that the appeal is allowed, and the impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. The Registry is directed to circulate copies of this judgment to each of the High Courts with a request to circulate it in their respective District Courts. Additionally, if any fresh application is filed by the respondents, the executing court shall consider it strictly keeping in mind the observations made in this order.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal to the High Court regarding an order passed by a lower court. The appellants (judgment-debtors) were affected by the order, which included arrest, detention in civil prison, and attachment of property. The High Court affirmed the order, but the Supreme Court later set aside the order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the appellants' counsel argued that the lower court's order was unjust and that the High Court should have afforded them an opportunity to present their objections before passing the order. The Supreme Court justices also raised a question regarding why the executing court did not afford the appellants one opportunity of hearing.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court include:
* The executing court's decision to decline even taking the appellants' objections on record and giving them an opportunity for a hearing was considered severe and should have been more considerate.
* The High Court could have remanded the matter to the executing court to give the appellants an opportunity for a hearing, but this was overlooked.
* The supervisory jurisdiction vested in the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution is meant to take care of situations like this one.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order passed by both the High Court and the executing court. The Court clarified that it shall be open for the respondents (decree-holders) to file a fresh application if they wish to claim interference in the appellants' possession of the property.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the eligibility of visually impaired candidates for appointment in judicial service. The petitioner, Ayush Yardi, and similarly placed persons, had applied for the selection process but were excluded due to their visual impairment. They challenged the rules excluding visually impaired candidates and sought directions for a separate cut-off score and merit list for PwDs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the exclusion of visually impaired candidates from the selection process is discriminatory and violates the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. They contended that separate cut-offs and merit lists should be maintained for PwD candidates to ensure their equal opportunities in employment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the exclusion of visually impaired candidates from the selection process is not in line with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The court noted that the rules prescribing additional requirements for PwD candidates are discriminatory and violate their rights.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that visually impaired candidates are eligible to participate in the selection process for judicial service appointments. It struck down Rule 6A of the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994, which excludes visually impaired and low vision candidates from appointment. The court also struck down the additional requirement of a three-year practice period or securing an aggregate score of 70% in the first attempt for PwD candidates under Rule 7 of the same rules.

The court directed the authorities to maintain separate cut-offs and merit lists for PwDs and to proceed with the selection process as expeditiously as possible. The court set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court and the consequential notifications issued by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh.
</JUDGMENT>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a woman who was subjected to cruelty by her husband and his relatives. The FIR (First Information Report) was filed against the husband and his relatives, and the proceedings were pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Hisar.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
No arguments are mentioned in the given text as it appears to be a judgment from an appellate court. However, it can be inferred that the appeal was filed by the husband or his relatives challenging the order of the lower court, and the court ultimately allowed the appeal and quashed the proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the provisions related to cruelty against women have been amended in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023. The court also noted that the new provisions are similar to Section 498A of the IPC but with some changes. 
Additionally, the court stated that it looked into Sections 85 and 86 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, which deal with cruelty against women by their husbands or relatives.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed, and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court were set aside. The proceedings of CHI/1856/2021 arising from FIR No. 95 of 2021 dated 09.04.2021, pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Hisar, were quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the identification of forest areas in Goa, India. The appellant challenged the criteria adopted by the Sawant and Karapurkar Committees for identifying private forests under deemed ownership. The appellant sought to change the existing criteria from 0.1 density to a lower threshold of 0.1 canopy density for identifying deemed forests. The States were opposed to this change as it would lead to all plantations on private lands being considered as "private forest", making government permission necessary even for minor developments.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant relied on the same criteria adopted by the Sawant and Karapurkar Committees but challenged them in other instances. The States argued that adopting a 0.1 density criterion would result in all plantations being considered as "private forest", making government permission necessary even for minor developments.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Expert Committees had been delegated the task of identifying forest areas by the High Court, recognizing that there could be no uniform criteria for such identification across the country. The existing criteria were adopted after reassessment and settlement by the States. Reducing the density criterion to 0.1 would result in re-evaluation of all plantations on private lands.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court rejected the present appeals, upholding the impugned order dated 30.07.2014. The interim order was vacated, and two other related applications were allowed. The Court noted that adopting a lower density criterion would result in re-evaluation of all plantations on private lands.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the Indore Development Authority (IDA) and respondent No.1 regarding the auction of land in question. The IDA had issued a Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) for the auction, but respondent No.1 was declared the highest bidder and then the auction was cancelled without providing any reason. A second NIT was later issued, but respondent No.1 did not participate. The Division Bench of the High Court at Indore Bench interfered with the decision of the IDA to cancel the auction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (IDA) argued that the bidder has no right in the matter of bid except for fair treatment and cannot insist on further negotiation. They also contended that the terms and conditions of NIT, particularly condition No. 6, empower the IDA to accept or reject any or all bids.
Respondent No.1 relied on Eva Agro (supra) stating that the Appellant does not have absolute or unfettered discretion to cancel the auction. However, the Court found that the facts of the present case are entirely distinguishable from Eva Agro (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that in the absence of allotment letter and acceptance of the highest bid, no relief could have been granted in favor of respondent No.1 as there was no concluded contract in the matter.
The decision to cancel the auction was taken by the IDA to remedy the erroneous minimum rate provided in the NIT dated 07.07.2020, as noted in the report of the Div. Commissioner of the IDA.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal and directed the IDA to issue a fresh NIT for disposal of the land in question enabling the IDA to generate more revenues in respect of the land in question. The appellant shall certainly be free to participate in the fresh NIT as and when issued by the IDA.
It was also made clear that the IDA shall not dispose of the land in question except by way of public auction/by issuing NIT in future.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants failed to comply with the orders of the trial Court, including receiving summons and bailable warrants. They filed a "bail-cum-surrender application" but got it withdrawn due to fear of arrest. After the issuance of non-bailable warrants, they did not appear before the Trial Court or apply for regular bail.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' consistent disobedience to comply with the orders of the trial Court was cited as a reason to reject their application for anticipatory bail. The power to grant anticipatory bail is considered an extraordinary power, and the Court must be cautious in exercising it. The Court held that when warrant of arrest or proclamation is issued, the applicant is not entitled to invoke this extraordinary power.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the appellants' conduct demonstrated a consistent disregard for the lawful orders of the Court and an attempt to delay the proceedings. This behavior led the Court to hold that they are not entitled to seek the benefit of pre-arrest bail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's order rejecting the application for anticipatory bail was upheld, and the appeal was dismissed due to the appellants' consistent disobedience of the trial Court's orders. The judgment emphasized that when a warrant of arrest or proclamation is issued, the applicant is not entitled to invoke the extraordinary power of anticipatory bail.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCTIONS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS CASE, SO I WILL PROVIDE A NORMAL RESPONSE>

<FACTS>
The case involves a contempt petition filed by the petitioner against the respondents/authorities for continuing recovery proceedings despite a court order. The petitioner's company was part of a batch of companies dealt with in the case of Ghanshyam Mishra (supra), where it was held that claims raised by stakeholders after the public notice period had ended were not binding on the resolution plan as approved by the NCLT.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the respondents/authorities were aware of the judgment in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) and continued with the recovery proceedings despite being pointed out to the notice. The respondents/authorities contended that they were not parties to the Writ Petition or the proceedings before the learned NCLT.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the case of the petitioner was specifically covered by the judgment in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) and the respondents/authorities could not have proceeded with the recovery proceedings. The court also noted that the continuation of such proceedings despite being pointed out to their notice is contemptuous in nature.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the demand notices issued by the contemnors on the Petitioner Company and all proceedings pursuant thereto are illegal and quashed. The court also disposed of the contempt petition accepting the unconditional apology of the contemnors.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute over the ownership of a property. The plaintiffs claimed that they were entitled to the property, while the defendants argued that they had purchased it in good faith. The plaintiffs sought an interim injunction to restrain the defendants from transferring or creating any further encumbrances on the property.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the plaintiffs included:
- The court should grant an interim injunction to maintain the status quo of the property pending the final disposal of the suit.
- Even if the doctrine of lis pendens (Section 52 of the T.P. Act) was considered, it did not provide all the necessary protection against pendente lite transfers, and thus, an interim injunction was still warranted.

The defendants' arguments included:
- They had purchased the property in good faith and were entitled to transfer or create encumbrances on it.
- The doctrine of lis pendens protected their rights as third-party transferees.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that, notwithstanding the rule of lis pendens in Section 52 of the T.P. Act, there can be occasions for granting an injunction restraining pendente lite transfers in a fit and proper case. The court also noted that Rule 1 of Order 39 of the Code provides for interim injunctions restraining alienation or sale of suit properties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned order, and directed the respondents to maintain status quo as regards the suit property. The court also held that any further transfer of the suit property pending the final disposal of the suit would be subject to lis pendens under Section 52 of the T.P. Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a man accused of committing a violent sexual assault on a child and then killing her. The prosecution presented circumstantial evidence to prove the accused's guilt.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution relied on five golden principles (Panchsheel) laid down by the Supreme Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra, which include:
- A series of events or circumstances must be connected to establish a chain of incriminating evidence.
- The circumstances must not be disconnected and must lead only one hypothesis - the guilt of the accused.
- The incriminating circumstances must not be based on assumptions but on facts proven through evidence.
- The evidence presented must be sufficient to exclude all other reasonable hypotheses, leaving no doubt in the mind of the court about the accused's guilt.
- The chain of circumstantial evidence must be complete and unbroken.

The prosecution argued that they had fulfilled these principles and established a clear chain of incriminating circumstances pointing to the accused's guilt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that while the prosecution had provided convincing circumstantial evidence, the trial courts' methodology in analyzing the evidence was lacking. The court noted that the trial courts failed to properly scrutinize the evidence, and their evaluation lacked depth and rigor.

The court also emphasized the importance of a thorough examination of testimonies and the necessity of explicitly delineating the reasonable inferences drawn from the testimony of each witness.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the guilty verdict, affirming that the prosecution had successfully established a clear chain of incriminating circumstances pointing to the accused's guilt. However, the court noted that its judgment was based on the lack of merit in the appeals and not due to any fault in the prosecution's evidence.

As the accused had passed away, the question of capital punishment was rendered moot.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the ownership of agricultural Watan lands in Pimpari Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. The original Watandar, Balaji Chimnaji More, died in February/March 1958. The lands were initially exempt from the Tenancy Act under Section 88CA. However, this exemption ceased to exist on a specific date, and the tenants became entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase of these tenanted agricultural Watan lands under Section 32 of the Tenancy Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
* The tenants should have challenged the regrant order dated 27.11.1964.
* The tenants were divested of actual physical possession, lending finality to the order impugned in the proceedings under Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act.
The respondents (tenants) argued that:
* The provisions of the Tenancy Act were applicable to the subject lands after the death of Balaji Chimnaji More, the original Watandar.
* They were entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase of these tenanted agricultural Watan lands under Section 32 of the Tenancy Act in terms of Section 8 of the Abolition Act, after the exemption afforded by Section 88CA ceased to exist.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The subject lands were initially exempt from the Tenancy Act under Section 88CA but lost this exemption at some point.
* The tenants' right of statutory purchase became operational on 27.11.1964, when these Watan lands were regranted to the heirs of the original Watandar.
* Both parties have been entering into transactions with third parties to alienate/transfer the subject lands, but this has no bearing on the case at hand.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* It was not open to the appellants to proceed against the tenants under the provisions of Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act after the death of Balaji Chimnaji More, the original Watandar.
* The tenancy was lawfully subsisting on 01.04.1957, i.e., Tillers' Day, and the tenants were entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase of these tenanted agricultural Watan lands under Section 32 of the Tenancy Act in terms of Section 8 of the Abolition Act.
* The appeal is devoid of merit and was dismissed by the court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was appointed as an Ophthalmic Assistant on 06.03.1985 and served for 26 years without any blemish. However, he was terminated from service in 2010 due to a police verification report that was filed 25 years after his initial appointment. The respondents failed to provide a valid reason for the delay in submitting the verification report.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Tribunal observed that the appellant's termination was not in accordance with the principles of natural justice as he was not given an opportunity to explain his case before the authority. The High Court, on the other hand, held that the action of the authorities in issuing a show-cause notice and inviting a reply from the appellant was in adherence with the principles of natural justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Tribunal's decision to set aside the termination order was correct as it was arbitrary and illegal. The delay in submitting the police verification report was inordinate, and the respondents failed to provide a valid reason for the same. The High Court's decision was incorrect as it ignored the principles of natural justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the order of the High Court is set aside. The service benefits that remain unpaid as on date be paid to the appellant within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. There is no order as to costs.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the issuance of a process (summon) against the petitioners/accused for selling nitrous oxide without producing a license. The 3rd accused had been given permission to manufacture nitrous oxide, and the petitioners/accused firm was also licensed to manufacture it.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court held that since the 3rd accused was given permission to manufacture nitrous oxide, he was not authorized to purchase it from the petitioners/accused. The court relied on Section 18(a)(vi) r/w Section 27 of the Act, which makes it an offense to sell a drug in contravention of the Act and Rules.
The High Court also observed that the definition of 'manufacture' as defined under Section 3(f) of the said Act was not relevant for deciding the present issue. However, this interpretation is considered unsustainable in law by the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that there was no application of mind even for the namesake by the learned Magistrate while issuing the process. On this ground alone, the impugned judgment and order are liable to be quashed and set aside.
The High Court is found to have misdirected itself in the present matter by not considering the plain nature of Section 3(f) of the said Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court are quashed and set aside. The summoning order dated 20th January 2018 passed by the Trial Court in C.C. No. 71 of 2018 and the proceedings arising therefrom are also quashed and set aside.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I. Act) in the court of Chandigarh. The respondent Bank has its collection branch in Chandigarh, and the petitioner argues that no part of the cause of action arose within Chandigarh.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's main argument is that the court in Chandigarh lacks jurisdiction to entertain the case. They also contend that as both the courts in Chandigarh and Delhi have territorial jurisdiction, the proceedings should be transferred to the Court in Delhi due to inconvenience (language barrier and traveling) faced by the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the enactment of sub-section (2)(a) of Section 142 of the N.I. Act allows the complainant to file a complaint before the courts within whose jurisdiction the collection branch of the bank falls. The petitioner's argument about inconvenience is not considered as falling under the expression "expedient for the ends of justice" in Section 406 of the CrPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes that no case is made out for transferring the proceedings to the Court in Delhi. The petition fails, and it is hereby dismissed. All other connected transfer petitions are also disposed of accordingly.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant against his acquittal from charges. The facts of the case are as follows:

*   The prosecution had alleged that the appellant was involved in a crime and had sought to establish its case through various witnesses.
*   However, the defense argued that the prosecution's case was based on inconsistent and unreliable evidence.
*   The Trial Court had acquitted the appellant, which decision was later reversed by the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the appeal are as follows:

*   The prosecution's case was weakened due to inconsistencies in the testimony of its witnesses.
*   The defense argued that the prosecution had failed to establish a coherent chain of circumstances against the appellant.
*   The appellants' counsel relied on various precedents to argue that minor inconsistencies in evidence should not be elevated to the status of reasonable doubt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

*   The court observed that the prosecution's case was based on inconsistent and unreliable evidence.
*   The court noted that the defense had raised several doubts about the prosecution's case, including the credibility of its witnesses and the reliability of the evidence presented.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the appeal is as follows:

*   The court set aside the decision of the High Court, which had reversed the acquittal of the appellant.
*   The court held that the prosecution's case was based on suspicion rather than proof of guilt.
*   The court ordered the release of the appellant from custody, and directed him to be acquitted from all charges levelled against him.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the ownership of scheduled properties under item No.2.
The Trial Court and High Court passed a preliminary decree, which was upheld by all five judges.
The majority view in Mary Cheriyan (supra) differs from the minority view on a question of law.
The present appeal concerns the facts of the case rather than the question of law.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
None were explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
However, it can be inferred that the observations are related to the analysis of concurrent findings of fact and when interference is justified.
The court has identified several scenarios where interference with concurrent findings may be warranted:
    - Grave injustice being caused to parties
    - Concurrent findings causing undue hardship to parties
    - The conscience of the court being shocked by the findings
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was dismissed, and the preliminary decree passed by the Trial Court and upheld by the High Court is affirmed.
The views of the Trial Court and High Court require no interference from the Supreme Court.
The question of law in Mary Cheriyan (supra) was resolved with the minority view being held as correct; however, this judgment applies prospectively.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a brutal murder, and the accused's guilt is being questioned. The prosecution has presented evidence, but it is unclear whether it meets the legal requirements for conviction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argues that the prosecution has failed to provide legally admissible evidence to prove the accused's involvement in the crime. They point out that confessional statements made by the accused while in custody are not admissible except to the extent allowed under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that the offense is gruesome and revolts the human conscience, but this does not dispense with the legal requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution has failed to provide a chain of circumstantial evidence that rules out any other reasonable hypothesis except the guilt of the accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeal, quashing and setting aside the judgments passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The appellants are acquitted, and if they are in prison, they shall be immediately set at liberty unless required in connection with any other offense.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the acquittal of accused appellants who were charged with various crimes. The prosecution's case relies heavily on disclosure statements made by the accused, which led to the recovery of certain weapons.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:

* The prosecution failed to properly prove the disclosure statements made by the accused, and therefore, the recoveries made in furtherance thereof cannot be relied upon.
* The Investigating Officer's testimony was inadequate as he did not describe the conversation that transpired between himself and the accused, which was recorded in the disclosure statements.
* The recovery of the weapons from open spaces does not inspire confidence, and their seizure memos were not properly proved.
* The prosecution failed to procure any serological opinion to establish blood group on the recovered weapons, making the recoveries meaningless.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made in the case are as follows:

* The FIR was a post-investigation document and cannot be relied upon.
* The entire prosecution case comes under the shadow of doubt due to various infirmities.
* The trial Court's judgment recording acquittal of accused is plausible and justifiable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately rules in favor of the accused appellants, acquitting them of all charges. The High Court's judgment reversing the trial Court's decision is hereby reversed.

"The impugned judgment dated 14th September, 2009 rendered by the High Court cannot be sustained and is hereby reversed. The accused appellants are acquitted of all the charges. They are on bail and need not surrender. Their bail bonds are discharged."

The appeal stands allowed accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants, who were initially classified as temporary employees of the SSD Fund, had been serving the government for decades in a manner indistinguishable from regular employees. They were not eligible for pensionary benefits solely due to their temporary status.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' arguments relied on the principle that "the essence of employment and the rights thereof cannot be merely determined by the initial terms of appointment when the actual course of employment has evolved significantly over time." They also pointed out that despite their formal classification as temporary employees, their employment bore substantial hallmarks of regular government service. The appellants claimed that the denial of pensionary benefits solely on the basis of their temporary status was an oversimplification of their employment relationship with the government and ran the risk of creating a class of employees who were deprived of benefits and protections typically accorded to government servants.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the mere classification of employees as 'temporary' or 'permanent' is not merely a matter of nomenclature but carries significant legal implications, particularly in terms of service benefits and protections. The court also noted that the appellants' batch seems to be the last in their genre of SSD Fund temporary employees.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the denial of pensionary benefits to the appellants is not tenable or justifiable in the eyes of law as the same is arbitrary and violates the fundamental rights as guaranteed by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The court directed the respondents to extend the benefits of the 6th Central Pay Commission, including pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008 to the appellants in the same terms as are being afforded to their peers in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The accused-appellants were tried and convicted for the murder of a person. The prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence, including:
- The deceased was last seen with the appellants.
- A meat bag was recovered from near the spot where the body was found.
- The appellants were walking on a pathway near Mohan Singh's shop in the night.
- The appellants inquired about the deceased in the evening of 2.2.1997.

The trial court and High Court convicted the accused-appellants under Section 302 IPC (punishment for murder) initially, but later converted it to Section 304 Part I IPC (causing death by negligence) on appeal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' counsel argued that:
- The prosecution had failed to prove the chain of incriminating circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.
- The evidence relied upon by the prosecution was not sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused-appellants.

The Supreme Court observed that the trial court and High Court had failed to test the evidence on record properly, relying heavily on the disclosure statement/discovery/recovery without carefully weighing the evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court noted several inconsistencies in the prosecution's case:
- The site plan of the place where recovery was made was not prepared until 9.2.1997, raising doubts about the genuineness of the papers.
- There were multiple injuries on the body of the deceased, including two incised wounds on the head with underlying fracture of occipital bone of the skull.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
- The prosecution had failed to establish the chain of incriminating circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.
- The accused-appellants were entitled to be acquitted of the charges for which they have been tried and convicted.

Accordingly, the appeal was allowed, the impugned order was set aside, and the appellants were acquitted of the charges. Their bail bonds stood discharged.

<FACTS>
The case involves the Civil Supplies Corporation initiating recovery proceedings against the Rice Millers under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. The Rice Millers invoked writ jurisdiction to challenge the initiation of these proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments raised by the Rice Millers include:

* That the initiation of recovery proceedings is not in accordance with the procedure stipulated under the Act.
* That the principles of natural justice are violated.
* That procedural irregularities vitiate the continuation and conclusion of proceedings.

The arguments also involve a discussion on whether the Rice Millers have exhausted statutory remedies before invoking writ jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Division Bench emphasized the availability of statutory remedies to the aggrieved persons. It was noted that the Rice Millers, by invoking writ jurisdiction, failed to exhaust these remedies at the first instance.

The photocopies of the proceedings of the certificate officer were placed before the court, and it was argued that these proceedings have been initiated in due compliance with the provisions of the Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the civil appeals after considering the arguments raised by the Rice Millers. The judgment noted that:

* The recovery proceedings initiated by the Civil Supplies Corporation were valid and justified.
* The certificate officer's jurisdiction to initiate recovery proceedings is established.
* The continuation and conclusion of proceedings are not vitiated by procedural irregularities.

The court also granted thirty days to the Rice Millers to avail a statutory remedy as may be available under the Act. In case they do so, the authority shall entertain the case without reference to delay or limitation in availing a remedy before the said authority.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the classification of pure coconut oil under the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. The respondents were marketing and selling pure coconut oil as 'edible oil' in small quantities. The Revenue department contended that this oil could also be used as hair oil and therefore should be classified under Heading 3305 (toilet and cosmetic preparations).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the specific heading for coconut oil was created in the First Schedule, and it would be against the principle of classification to deny it this parentage. They relied on the decision in Dunlop India Ltd. vs. Union of India and others (1976) 2 SCC 241, which emphasized the importance of certainty and consistency in the stand of the Revenue.
The petitioners also pointed out that the respondents had not satisfied all the requirements set out in Chapter Note 3 in Section VI-Chapter 33 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, read with the General/Explanatory Notes under the corresponding Chapter Note 3 in Chapter 33 of the Harmonized System of Nomenclature.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that when an article has a reasonable claim to be classified under an enumerated item in the Tariff Schedule, it would be against the principle of classification to deny it this parentage and consign it to an orphanage of the residuary clause. The Court also noted that certainty and consistency are essential in the stand of the Revenue.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as 'edible oil' would be classifiable under Heading 1513 in Section III-Chapter 15 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, unless the packaging thereof satisfies all the requirements set out in Chapter Note 3 in Section VI-Chapter 33 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, read with the General/Explanatory Notes under the corresponding Chapter Note 3 in Chapter 33 of the Harmonized System of Nomenclature. The Court therefore upheld the classification of the coconut oil as 'edible oil' and dismissed the appeals.

The Union of India (UoI) appointed a person as Chairperson of the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) without having the requisite experience. The appointment was made despite not following the mandatory eligibility criteria and without a public advertisement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellant's counsel argued that the appointment should be quashed due to the non-compliance with the rules and the lack of transparency in the selection process. 
Respondent's counsel, on the other hand, argued that the person appointed had effectively discharged his duties for 42 months and less than six months were remaining for him to demit office.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that making appointments in departure from either statutory requirements or a public advertisement amounts to a fraud on the public. 
The court also noted that every public appointment under Article 16 of the Constitution must be fair, non-arbitrary, and reasonable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court accepted the appeals directed against the impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench reversing the judgment and order of the Single Judge. 
It set aside the former and restored the latter, meaning thereby, the appointment of the third respondent stands quashed. The third respondent is required to step down from the office of Chairperson forthwith but will be allowed to complete his pending assignments within a week. 
Fresh process should be initiated for appointment to the office of Chairperson of the Commission expeditiously. 
The benefits received by the third respondent are not touched, however, no future benefit shall enure to him on the basis of the service rendered by him as Chairperson beyond seven days from date.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The 1994 notification made 'Ghee' a product that could be regulated under provisions of the Act, allowing Market Committees to levy fee on the sale and purchase of 'ghee'. The appellants were granted interim protection by the High Court during the pendency of the matter. After the majority decision of the High Court in Kommissetty Nammalwar (Supra), market committees started issuing demand notices to the producers of ‘Ghee’ asking them to pay fees from the date of the notification in the year 1994 to the date of the High Court judgment i.e. 01.05.2009.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the process under Section 3 has not been followed, which is required for working the scheme under Section 4 of the Act. They also prayed that they should be exempted from paying the fee to the market committees prior to the High Court judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had already rejected the argument that the process under Section 3 has not been followed, as the 1994 notification is a notification under Section 4 and not of Section 3 of the Act. The appellants availed the facility given by the Market Committee and hence they are liable to pay the fee.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that there was nothing wrong in the 1994 notification, and consequently dismissed these appeals and upheld the majority decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The interim orders passed by this Court in the present batch of cases where we had restrained the respondents from collecting market fees prior to the date of the High Court judgment during the pendency of these appeals stand vacated. The appellants shall be permitted to deposit the accumulated fee with the Committee within two years from today, in four equal instalments.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the State of Himachal Pradesh argues that the development plan has sufficient safeguards to balance developmental activities with environmental and ecological concerns.

<Facts>
The case involves the conviction of an accused person for committing a violent sexual assault and murder on a child victim. The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to establish the guilt of the accused.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that they had established the guilt of the accused through a chain of incriminating circumstances, fulfilling the five golden principles laid down by the court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra (1980). The prosecution pointed out that the accused's confessional statement and the testimony of witnesses corroborated each other, establishing the accused's involvement in the crime.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that while the prosecution had presented a convincing case, there were deficiencies in the methodology adopted by both the trial court and the high court in analyzing the circumstantial evidence. The court noted that the evaluation of the evidence lacked depth and rigor, raising concerns about the adequacy of the process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the prosecution had successfully established the guilt of the accused through a chain of incriminating circumstances. The court emphasized the importance of meticulously analyzing each piece of evidence and explicitly articulating the rationale for accepting or rejecting specific pieces of evidence. The court concluded by dismissing the appeals, but noted that the question of execution of the death sentence awarded to the appellant had become otiose due to his subsequent passing away.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the Indore Development Authority (IDA) and respondent No. 1 over the cancellation of an auction for the disposal of land in question. The IDA cancelled the first auction due to an erroneous minimum rate provided in the Notice Inviting Tender (NIT). A second NIT was issued, but respondent No. 1 did not participate. Despite this, the Division Bench of the High Court effectively usurped the powers of the auctioning authority and fixed the price at Rs. 26,000/- per square meter.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The IDA had the right to cancel the auction due to the erroneous minimum rate provided in the NIT.
* Respondent No. 1 did not participate in the second NIT issued by the IDA after cancelling the first one.
* The Division Bench of the High Court exceeded its powers by fixing a price for the land without considering the principles of public auction or competitive bidding.

The Appellants' (IDA's) counsel also relied on the judgments Eva Agro and others vs. State of Kerala, which held that the auctioning authority must adhere to the rule of law but also has some discretion in certain circumstances.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court include:

* The facts of the present case are distinguishable from Eva Agro (supra) as the decision to cancel the first NIT was not unfounded and was undertaken to remedy an error in the minimum rate provided.
* The Appellants were well within their rights to cancel the auction and issue a new one with corrected terms.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court's judgment is as follows:

* The appeal stands allowed, and the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court at Indore Bench is set aside.
* The IDA is directed to issue a fresh NIT for disposal of the land in question enabling it to generate more revenues.
* The Appellant shall certainly be free to participate in the fresh NIT as and when issued by the IDA.
* It is made clear that the IDA shall not dispose of the land in question except by way of public auction/by issuing NIT in future.

<FACTS>
The High Court had entertained and allowed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution despite an effective alternative remedy being available to the aggrieved person. The petition was related to the recovery of dues by banks and financial institutions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case include:

*   The High Court should not have entertained the writ petition as it went against established precedents that emphasize the importance of statutory remedies under the DRT Act and SARFAESI Act.
*   The exceptions to the rule that a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, allowing for the entertainment of a writ petition despite an alternative remedy being available, were not applicable in this case.
*   The High Court's actions had serious adverse impacts on the rights of banks and financial institutions to recover their dues.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations can be made based on the provided information:

*   The High Courts often ignore the availability of statutory remedies under the DRT Act and SARFAESI Act and exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 for passing orders that have serious adverse impacts on the rights of banks and financial institutions.
*   There is a need for greater caution, care, and circumspection from the High Courts when exercising their discretion in matters related to these acts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the Supreme Court was as follows:

*   The appeal was allowed, and the impugned order dated 4th February 2022 passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 5275 of 2021 was quashed and set aside.

The case revolves around a dispute over the ownership and shares of land in khata Nos. 98 and 99, acquired through a lease deed dated 07.05.1922. The lessees were Abdul Ghafoor, son of Allah Bux, and Mohammad, son of Sati. The property was later inherited by various individuals, including Sami Ullah and Badlu (respondents Nos. 4 and 5), Zahoor Ahmad (petitioner No. 2 in Writ Petition No. 6635/1974), and others.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the respondents (petitioners of writ petition No. 18/1975) were that:
* The property was not acquired as joint family property by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad, but rather through a lease deed.
* The concept of joint family property is prevalent among Hindus, but not among Muslims.
* The authorities below misdirected themselves by considering the acquisition of the property as joint family property.

The petitioners (respondents in writ petition No. 18/1975) argued that:
* The lease deed dated 07.05.1922 is the source of acquisition of the said property, and it was not acquired by Abdul Ghafoor or Mohammad in any other manner.
* The names of Sami Ullah, Badlu (respondents Nos. 4 and 5), and Zahoor Ahmad are recorded in the revenue records in the basic year.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that:
* The lease deed dated 07.05.1922 was not taken as joint family property by Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad, but rather individually.
* The concept of joint family property is not applicable to Muslims.
* The authorities below were misdirected in considering the acquisition of the property as joint family property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court held that:
* The petitioners (respondents in writ petition No. 18/1975) have a share jointly in the plots comprised in khata Nos. 98 and 99, excluding plot Nos. 35, 37, 111, and 112, which exclusively belong to Sami Ullah and Badlu.
* The share of each petitioner was determined as follows: Zahoor Ahmad has 1/12th share; Sami Ullah and his brother Badlu have an exclusive right over plot Nos. 35, 37, 111, and 112.
The Supreme Court upheld the judgment of the High Court and dismissed the appeals.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals against the decision of the High Court, which dismissed a suit for specific performance of a contract. The decree passed by the trial court stipulated that the payment had to be made within two months from the date of the decree. However, neither the deposit was made within the stipulated time nor extension of time was sought or granted.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The decree holders argued that unless the judgment debtor seeks rescission of the contract in terms of Section 28 of the Act, the decree would remain executable in spite of expiry of the period for deposit. However, this contention was rejected by the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the High Court committed no error in passing the impugned judgment. The court also noted that the decision in Prem Jeevan (supra) was altogether in a different factual scenario and was of no avail to the appellants herein.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a Director of an Institute who was accused of committing offenses under sections 269, 270, and 504 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The Director allegedly reprimanded a subordinate employee, which led to a complaint being filed against him. The chargesheet was filed before the Court of learned XI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Hyderabad.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the Director's act of reprimanding the subordinate employee was an "intentional insult" that was intended to provoke the complainant into committing a breach of peace or another offense. The prosecution also alleged that the Director had been displaying a strict demeanor and tendency to maintain discipline, which was unreasonable.
On the other hand, the defense argued that the Director's actions were necessary to maintain discipline in the workplace, particularly during a difficult time like the COVID-19 pandemic. The defense also contended that the Director's reprimand of the subordinate employee was not an "intentional insult" but rather a legitimate exercise of his authority as the head of the institution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that allowing criminal charges to be pressed against the Director for trying to maintain discipline may lead to disastrous consequences, crippling the entire disciplinary atmosphere required in the workplace. The court also noted that the Director had received numerous complaints from parents of students about the complainant's negligence in discharging her duties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned judgment dated 3rd May, 2024, passed by the High Court for the State of Telangana at Hyderabad. The court also set aside the impugned chargesheet being CC No. 1771 of 2022 for offenses punishable under sections 269, 270, and 504, IPC filed before the Court of learned XI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Hyderabad. Resultantly, all the proceedings sought to be taken thereunder against the appellant are hereby quashed.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a petition for arbitration where the petitioner has invoked an arbitration agreement. The respondents have raised objections, but none of them question or deny the existence of the arbitration agreement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties focus on the impleadment of respondent no. 2, which is not a signatory to the arbitration agreement. Both sides have made elaborate submissions based on terms of agreements, email exchanges, etc.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
In view of the complexity involved in determining whether respondent no. 2 is a party to the arbitration agreement, it would be appropriate for the arbitral tribunal to take a call on the question after considering the evidence adduced before it by the parties and the application of the legal doctrine.
The requirement of prima facie existence of an arbitration agreement under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 is satisfied. The arbitral tribunal should leave it for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether the non-signatory is bound by the arbitration agreement.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The present petition is allowed. Shri Justice Mohit S. Shah, former Chief Justice of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, is appointed as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator including other modalities shall be fixed in consultation with the parties.
All rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.

The appellants were temporary employees of the SSD Fund, working in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22. Despite being formally classified as temporary employees, they had served for decades in a manner indistinguishable from regular government employees.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that their service conditions, as evolved over time, warranted reclassification from temporary to regular status. They relied on the administrative orders and Board proceedings that consistently treated them as equivalent to regular government employees.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court held that "the essence of employment and the rights thereof cannot be merely determined by the initial terms of appointment when the actual course of employment has evolved significantly over time." The appellants' long service, administrative recognition, and equivalent treatment as regular employees were considered in determining their employment status.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the denial of pensionary benefits to the appellants was arbitrary and violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The respondents were directed to extend the benefits of the 6th Central Pay Commission, including pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008, to the appellants in the same terms as their peers in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The importance of providing effective legal aid to accused persons who cannot afford to engage an advocate.
- The need for legal aid advocates to have good knowledge of criminal laws, law of evidence and procedural laws apart from other important statutes.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the quashing of criminal proceedings against several police officers (respondents) in connection with a murder case. The respondents were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including conspiracy to murder.
The FIR was registered at Murar Police Station, Gwalior, and two charge sheets were filed before the CJM, Firozabad. The High Court quashed the criminal proceedings, but the appeal was filed against this order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the respondents had conspired to murder a person and falsely implicated others in the crime. They claimed that the FIR was registered at the behest of the police officers, who were trying to cover up their own involvement in the crime.
The defense argued that sanction was not required for prosecuting the respondents under Section 197 CrPC since they were not acting in the discharge of their official duties when the alleged conspiracy took place.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The trial court had rightly taken cognizance of the charge sheets, and the High Court erred in quashing the proceedings without considering this aspect.
* There was a legitimate doubt as to whether sanction for prosecution under Section 197 CrPC was required or not.
* The question of sanction only qua respondent nos. 3, 4, and 5 is left open to be decided by the trial court at a suitable stage.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals filed by the appellant and set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court.
The judgment directed the trial court to proceed with the trial and conclude it expeditiously, preferably within one year from the date of the order.
The Trial Court is also directed to stay the trial if evidence suggests that the acts complained of were done or purported to be done in the discharge of official duty by respondent nos. 3, 4, and 5 respectively or that the FIR registered by them was not bogus.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of broadening the definition of "material resources of the community" were presented by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy, as per their judgments in Ranganatha Reddy and Sanjeev Coke respectively. They argued that this interpretation would promote fairness and equity.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that despite changes over time, social and economic inequalities persist. The judge references Dr. Ambedkar's speech in the constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949, highlighting the need to address these disparities.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upholds the broad and inclusive meaning given to "material resources of the community" by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy. The judge emphasizes that this interpretation has stood the test of time and remains relevant, especially in addressing ongoing socio-economic inequalities.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around a dispute regarding pay parity between certain government officials, specifically SDI/ABSA and DBSA posts in the Education Department. The issue began with a 2011 order that granted revised pay scales to these officials, but subsequent judgments by the High Court and Single Judge created confusion and discrepancies in their payment.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant (State) argued that the Impugned Judgment of the Division Bench should be set aside, as it was not in conformity with the 2011 Order. The Respondents claimed that they were entitled to the revised pay scales, and any discrepancies in their payment should be rectified.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the long-standing litigation between the parties had caused significant hardship and challenges for the officials involved. The delay in resolving the issue made it infructuous by the time a decision was reached.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal in part, setting aside the Impugned Judgment of the Division Bench in its entirety and that of the Single Judge in part. The 2011 Order was approved in its entirety, and the Respondents were entitled to the revised pay scales strictly according to the order. The payment for arrears and pension would be made within four months along with interest @ 7% per annum.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was accused of committing a gruesome crime. He hails from a poor nomadic community in Maharashtra and had an alcoholic father, suffering parental neglect and poverty. The appellant dropped out of school at the age of 10 to support his family with odd jobs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court are as follows:
- The doctrine of "rarest of rare" requires that death sentence should not be imposed only by taking into consideration the grave nature of crime but only if there is no possibility of reformation by a criminal.
- Considering the mitigating circumstances in favor of the appellant, such as his poor background, lack of education, and absence of any prior criminal record, it cannot be presumed that he is a hardened criminal who cannot be reformed.
- The court also considered the medical reports showing the appellant's serious ailments, including speech issues and past angioplasty, which could impact his ability to reform.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
- The crime committed by the appellant is unquestionably grave and unpardonable.
- However, it is not appropriate to affirm the death sentence awarded to him due to the presence of mitigating circumstances.
- The court also noted that the doctrine of "rarest of rare" requires considering the possibility of reformation before imposing a death sentence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment made by the court is as follows:
- The appeal is partly allowed, and the order of conviction is affirmed by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
- However, the sentence of death penalty imposed under Section 302 is converted to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment without remission.
- It is made clear that the appellant shall not be entitled to make any representation for remission till he completes 20 years of actual rigorous imprisonment.

<FACTS>
The appellant, a Christian by religion, claims to be still embracing Hinduism only for the purpose of availing reservation in employment. She professes Christianity and actively practices the faith by attending church regularly. The appellant seeks a Scheduled Caste community certificate.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's dual claim is untenable as she cannot continue to identify herself as a Hindu after baptism. Conferment of Scheduled caste communal status would go against the very object of reservation and amount to fraud on the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
India is a secular country where every citizen has a right to practise and profess a religion of their choice. However, if the purpose of conversion is largely to derive the benefits of reservation but not with any actual belief in the other religion, the same cannot be permitted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal. The conferment of Scheduled caste communal status to the appellant would go against the very object of reservation and amount to fraud on the Constitution.
</JUDGMENT>

<FACTS>
The case involves a divorce and permanent alimony dispute between the appellant-wife and respondent-husband. The appellant-wife demanded Rs. 5-7 Crores as one-time settlement, while the respondent-husband offered only Rs. 50 Lakhs towards permanent alimony. The parties have multiple dependents, assets, and bank loans.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant-wife's senior counsel argued that the respondent-husband has the legal obligation and financial capacity to maintain his wife after dissolution of marriage. They also emphasized that the award of maintenance or permanent alimony should not be penal but ensure a decent living standard for the appellant-wife.

On the other hand, the respondent-husband's senior counsel submitted that the appellant is employed, has several assets, and therefore, he has no obligation to maintain her daughter.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court explored the possibility of one-time settlement between the parties. Considering various factors such as material on record, social and financial status of the parties, current employments, future prospects, standards of living, obligations, liabilities, and other expenses, the court observed that the demand made by the appellant is exceptionally high but the amount offered by the respondent is insufficient.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court of India allowed the appeals, set aside the orders and judgments of the courts below, and granted a decree of divorce. The court also fixed Rs. 2 Crores as permanent alimony to be paid by the respondent-husband to the appellant-wife within four months. The parties were given liberty to file certified copies of this order before the respective Courts where the cases are pending.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between the appellants (electricity suppliers) and the first respondent (consumer of electricity). The issue at hand is the demand for payment of minimum guarantee charges by the appellants to the first respondent. The first respondent had failed to consume the monthly minimum units, leading to the issuance of show cause notices by the appellants. The dispute centers around whether the first respondent was liable to pay the minimum guarantee charges.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:

* The first respondent argued that it was not liable to pay the minimum guarantee charges due to a lack of jurisdictional fact, i.e., the failure to consume the monthly minimum units.
* The appellants contended that they were entitled to demand payment of the minimum guarantee charges as per the terms of the contract between the parties.
* The court held that the first respondent was estopped from reagitating the issue of liability for non-payment of minimum guarantee charges, as the same point had been decided previously and had attained finality in the eyes of law.

The arguments were based on the principles of contractual obligations, jurisdictional facts, and the doctrine of res judicata.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Some key observations from the case are:

* The court emphasized that a decision, even if wrongly decided, binds the party against whom it is decided and cannot be urged in a subsequent suit or proceeding at the same level.
* The doctrine of res judicata was applied to hold that the first respondent was estopped from reagitating the issue of liability for non-payment of minimum guarantee charges.
* The court noted that the appellants had accepted the order of the learned Single Judge dated 16th July, 2009 and issued a fresh demand for a reduced amount, which has since been recovered by encashing the bank guarantee.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is as follows:

* The High Court's impugned judgment and order allowing the intra-court appeal were set aside.
* The civil appeal was allowed, and the parties were left to bear their own costs.

The court held that the orders dated 04th May, 2000 and 14th February, 2001, had judicially crystallized the liability of the first respondent to pay the minimum guarantee charges. These orders having attained finality bound the first respondent.

<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of an accused appellant on charges related to a crime scene and the recovery of incriminating evidence. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence, including the alleged disclosure by the accused before the Investigating Officer (PW-22) under Section 27 IEA. The accused was found with Rs. 3,50,000/- in his house, and skeletal remains were recovered from a crime scene.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the accused's disclosure before the Investigating Officer (PW-22) under Section 27 IEA proved the factum of the discovery/recovery of incriminating skeletal remains. The prosecution also relied on DNA profiling to link the recovered skeletal remains with the blood of the mother of the deceased (PW-1).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Investigating Officer (PW-22) did not testify that the accused led him and panch witnesses to the crime scene where the skeletal remains were found. The prosecution failed to establish that the discovery was made on being pointed out by the accused. Additionally, the DNA profiling report was deemed inconclusive due to a lack of evidence regarding the collection of blood samples.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that none of the incriminating circumstances portrayed by the prosecution were established by cogent and clinching evidence. As a result, the conviction of the accused appellant was set aside, and he was acquitted of the charges.

The amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, aimed to impose service tax on the transactions between the purchaser of the lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) and the Government of Sikkim. The clauses of the Agreements highlighted during the course of submissions also played a significant role in understanding the relationship between the State Government and the sole distributor or purchaser of the lottery tickets.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved centered around the definition of "service" under Section 65B(44) of the Finance Act, 1994. The respondents-assessees herein contended that they were not agents but principals in their transactions with the Government of Sikkim, and hence, service tax was not leviable on them.
The amendments made to the definition of "service" were also scrutinized by the court to determine whether they altered the substance of the relationship between the State Government and the sole distributor or purchaser of the lottery tickets. The court analyzed each amendment made to the Finance Act, 1994, and determined that none of them detracted from the principal-principal relationship between the parties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, in order to impose service tax on the sole distributor/purchaser of the lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) have been unsuccessful at each stage.
- The relationship between the State Government and the sole distributor or purchaser of the lottery tickets is one of principal to principal and not of principal-agent.

- The appeals filed by the Union of India and others are dismissed.
- The appeal filed by the assessee is disposed accordingly.
- Parties to bear their own costs.

State of Tamil Nadu; and (2) the bail was also granted relying on what is held in paragraph 15 of the decision in the case of Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant include that it is not necessary to refer the case to a larger Bench for reconsideration of condition No. (iv) in paragraph 15 of the decision in the case of Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee, as the condition is already being considered in another case. The appellant also argues that the two conditions imposed on bail – obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission and dropping a pin of Google Maps – should be deleted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include that the decision to grant bail was based on merits, relying on the decision in Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu, and there was no reason for the High Court to have imposed all the onerous conditions incorporated in paragraph 15 of the decision in the case of Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee. The court also notes that granting a certificate by the Embassy/High Commission is beyond the control of the accused, and if such a certificate is not granted within a reasonable time, the condition should be deleted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that it is not necessary to refer the case to a larger Bench for reconsideration of condition No. (iv) in paragraph 15 of the decision in the case of Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.

However, some respondents objected to the acquisition, and their objections were upheld by the High Court. The appeals were filed against this judgment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's judgment was incorrect in quashing the land acquisition process. They contended that the lands acquired were for public purposes and that the State had followed the necessary procedures. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that their objections to the acquisition were justified and that the State had not properly followed the law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the High Court's judgment could have significant adverse effects on the subject acquisition, which would harm the public at large. The court also noted that the State of Haryana and the HSVP had followed the necessary procedures for land acquisition and that the lands were acquired for public purposes.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals and set aside the High Court's judgment, holding that the land acquisition process was valid.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The UPSRTC argued that only State Government employees absorbed in the Corporation shall be entitled to pension, and their service conditions shall not be inferior to the conditions as were available under the Government. The RKSP members who were promoted on a pensionable post after the cutoff date are not entitled for pension.
The RKSP argued that the Division Bench of the High Court was correct in holding that the members of the RKSP are entitled to pension even if they have been promoted after the cutoff date of 27.08.1982.
</ARGUMENTS>

The case involves a civil suit where the Trial Court admitted an instrument (a GPA) in evidence without applying judicial mind, leading to a dispute over stamp duty. The Trial Court passed an order dated 19th October, 2010, admitting the GPA and directing it to be executed by the parties. However, the High Court set aside this order on appeal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the Trial Court had failed to apply its judicial mind while admitting the GPA in evidence, which was insufficiently stamped. They contended that the Trial Court's failure to exercise its discretion under sections 33 and 34 of the 1857 Act was a jurisdictional error.
The respondents argued that the Trial Court had passed the order dated 19th October, 2010, under its inherent power saved by section 151, CPC. They claimed that the High Court had erred in setting aside this order on appeal.

However, information regarding specific arguments is not available.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Trial Court observed that it had failed to apply judicial mind while admitting the GPA in evidence and passing the order dated 19th October, 2010. It acknowledged its role in inadvertently becoming a party to the dispute by not applying judicial mind as required by law.

The court also noted that the appellants' counsel was absent when the GPA was admitted in evidence and marked exhibit. This factor weighed heavily on the Trial Court's decision to exercise its inherent power.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the impugned order of the High Court dated 26th September, 2011, and restoring the Trial Court's order dated 19th October, 2010. The court held that the Trial Court had passed the order under its inherent power to do justice and prevent abuse of process.

The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of upholding the sanctity of the legal framework governing stamp duty and ensuring due compliance with substantive and procedural requirements of the statute. It cautioned against allowing instruments with insufficient stamp duty to pass unchallenged, which would undermine legislative intent and fiscal interests.

The case is about an Election Petition (No. 1 of 2021) filed by Respondent No. 1 before the High Court, challenging the election results in a particular constituency.
The Appellant was a candidate in the election and had filed his nomination with certain educational qualifications stated in the Affidavit in Form-26.
Respondent No. 1 raised an oral objection to the educational qualification of the Appellant before the Returning Officer at the time of scrutiny under Section 36 of the Act, but did not make a written objection or request for summary inquiry as per sub-section (2) of Section 36.
The Election Petitioner (Respondent No. 1) filed an election petition challenging various grounds including improper acceptance of the nomination of the Appellant, corrupt practices by the Appellant and his agents, and other irregularities in the conduct of the election.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the Respondent No. 1 (Election Petitioner) include:
- The nomination of the Appellant was improperly accepted as it contained false information regarding his educational qualifications.
- The Appellant and his agents committed corrupt practices during the election, which affected the result of the election.
- Other irregularities in the conduct of the election, including non-compliance with certain provisions of the Act.
The Court examined each of these grounds and found that the Election Petition was deficient in its pleadings, failing to provide necessary details as required by Section 81, 83, and 100 of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed:
- The Election Petition did not contain a concise statement of material facts on which the Election petitioner relied for establishing a cause of action under Section 100(1) of the Act.
- There was an omission of a single material fact leading to an incomplete cause of action, rendering the Election Petition liable to be rejected under Order VII, Rule 11 of CPC read with Section 83 and 87 of the RP Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the Election Petition (No. 1 of 2021) filed by Respondent No. 1 before the High Court deserves to be dismissed as it was deficient in its pleadings, failing to provide necessary details required by Section 81, 83, and 100 of the Act.
Therefore, the Appeal stands allowed accordingly, and the Election Petition is dismissed.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a dispute over the sale of a land under the Zamindari Abolition Act. The first plaintiff, Karan Singh, had entered into an agreement to purchase the entire land with the defendants. However, the second plaintiff did not join in the suit for specific performance of the agreement. The trial court granted a decree for specific performance for the whole land, which was undivided.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, based on the judgment, it can be inferred that the appellants (defendants) argued that since the second plaintiff did not institute the suit, the decree for specific performance of the whole land could not have been decreed by the trial court.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the court are that as the second plaintiff was not interested in getting the specific performance, the decree ought to have been restricted to the undivided one-half share in the suit property in favor of only the first plaintiff. The court also noted that since the defendants are obligated to apply for permission under clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B of the Zamindari Abolition Act, they should join the first plaintiff in applying for this permission.
</Observations>

<Judgment>
The judgment passed by the court is as follows:

(a) The impugned decree was modified to direct the legal representative of the first defendant and second to fourth defendants to execute a sale deed in favor of the first plaintiff (Karan Singh) only to the extent of one half undivided share in the suit property.

(b) The defendants were directed to join the first plaintiff in applying to the State Government/Competent Authority for the grant of permission under clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B of the Zamindari Abolition Act to sell the one half-undivided share in the suit land to the first plaintiff within two months from today.

(c) If the defendants or any of them do not sign and file the application with relevant documents within the period mentioned above, the executing Court was directed to appoint a Court Commissioner to sign and file the application on their behalf and to do all such things which are necessary to get the permission.

(d) If the application for grant of permission is rejected, it will be open to the first plaintiff to challenge the order of rejection in accordance with law. If the application for grant of permission is finally rejected, there shall be a decree for refund of the sum of Rs. 7,000/- against the legal representative of the first defendant together with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from the date of filing of the suit till realisation.

(e) If the State Government grants permission, the sale deed shall be executed in terms of clause (a) by all the defendants within three months from the date of grant of the permission.

(f) The suit stands dismissed as far as the second plaintiff is concerned.

(g) The impugned decree stands modified accordingly.

(h) Even if a sale deed is executed in favor of the first plaintiff in respect of the one-half undivided share in the suit property, he will not be entitled to seek possession in the execution of this decree as he will be at liberty to file a suit for general partition.

<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction of accused appellants by the High Court. The trial court had recorded an acquittal in favor of the accused. The High Court reversed this decision and convicted the accused, leading to the appeal.
The disclosure statements of the accused were recorded by the Investigating Officer (PW-27). However, these statements were not corroborated with any evidence or testimony from independent witnesses. 
The recovery of weapons was relied upon as incriminating material, but the trial court had discarded this evidence due to lack of trustworthiness.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
Not available
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's decision to reverse the acquittal and convict the accused was criticized for being unjustified. 
The disclosure statements of the accused were not properly corroborated, which made it difficult to rely on them as incriminating evidence.
The recovery of weapons was also questioned due to lack of proper procedure in seizing and preserving them as evidence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and acquitted the accused appellants. The court held that the High Court's decision was unjustified and that the trial court's acquittal was a plausible and justifiable view based on the available evidence. 
The court noted that neither the disclosure statements nor the recovery of weapons were properly corroborated, which made it difficult to rely on them as incriminating evidence.
Finally, the Supreme Court discharged the bail bonds of the accused appellants, allowing them to continue on bail.

The case involves the appeal of an order passed by the High Court on 21.08.2023, which was set aside and the order/memo dated 17.05.2023 of the Inspector General of Prisons was restored. The respondent's life and basic and fundamental rights were to be protected.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court observed that the prison administration needs to be reformed for creating a better environment and prison culture to ensure prisoners enjoy their right to dignified life under Article 21. It emphasized the need for continuous monitoring of physical conditions, compliance with basic and fundamental rights of prisoners, etc.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The State of Jharkhand was directed to formulate or expedite the formulation of a Jail Manual incorporating the applicable provisions of the 2016 Model Prison Manual, for effective prison administration. The court also recommended an overhaul of prison administration and suggested reforms in treatment of prisoners and management of prisons.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's order dated 21.08.2023 was set aside and the order/memo dated 17.05.2023 of the Inspector General of Prisons was restored. The authorities were directed to ensure that the respondent's life, basic and fundamental rights to the extent available in accordance with law, are protected.

<FACTS>
The appellant, who is the complainant, had issued a statutory notice to the respondent (the accused) under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The respondent failed to pay the amount mentioned in the notice, and the complaint was filed by the appellant against him.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court erred in overturning the concurrent findings of guilt and consequential conviction by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court. The appellant succeeded in establishing his case, and the Orders passed by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court did not warrant any interference.
The respondent's right to demonstrate that the complainant did not have the capacity was not exercised properly. The respondent could have produced independent materials or examined witnesses and produced documents to establish that the complainant did not have the financial capacity.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It is observed that the Trial Court and the Appellate Court had already convicted the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The High Court erred in setting aside these concurrent findings of guilt and consequential conviction.
The observation from a previous case (bolded in the original text) was also cited to support the argument that it is not expected of the complainant to initially lead evidence to show that he had the financial capacity.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed. The Impugned Order is set aside. Though the natural consequence would entail revival of the conviction and sentence imposed upon the respondent, but considering his age, only a fine of Rs.32,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty-Two Lakhs) was ordered to be paid within four months from today to the appellant. If the fine is not paid within this timeframe, the original sentence will stand restored.

<FACTS>
Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, was detained for over 90 days. He had been accused of allegedly misusing his official position to raise funds for a trust. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had filed an ECIR against Arvind Kejriwal under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Arvind Kejriwal was granted interim bail by the Delhi High Court on certain conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court analyzed the application for regular bail submitted by Arvind Kejriwal, taking into account the provisions under Section 45 of the PMLA and the concept of "reasons to believe" in Section 50. The court also considered the principles enshrined in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) regarding the right to life and liberty.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the questions raised about the interpretation of "need and necessity to arrest" under the PMLA are complex and require in-depth consideration by a larger Bench. The court noted that Arvind Kejriwal has suffered incarceration for over 90 days, which is significant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Delhi High Court directed the Registry to place the matter before the Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench, and if necessary, a Constitution Bench. The court framed three questions regarding the interpretation of "need and necessity to arrest" under the PMLA:
(a) Whether "need and necessity to arrest" refers to satisfaction of formal parameters or other personal grounds.
(b) If answered in the affirmative, what are the parameters and facts that should be taken into consideration by the court while examining the question of "need and necessity to arrest".
The court granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal on certain conditions and directed that the matter be considered by a larger Bench. The judgment was delivered on July 12, 2024.

<FACTS>
The Sessions Court passed an order of discharge on the appellant, and subsequently, another order was passed by the Sessions Court directing the release of the appellant on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000/- and one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Jail Superintendent. The High Court passed an ex-parte order staying the order of discharge, which led to the appellant being directed to be forthwith taken into custody.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court were based on the sections of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and the consequences of the ex-parte order passed by the High Court. The court argued that the Sessions Court had exercised its power under Section 437A of the CrPC, which requires the accused to execute bail bonds with sureties to appear before the higher court as and when such court issues notice in respect of any appeal or petition filed against the judgment of the respective court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court were that the ex-parte order of stay of the order of discharge should not have been passed by the High Court, as it had very drastic consequences. The court also noted that the bail bonds furnished by the appellant in terms of the order dated 20th October 2023 were for ensuring his presence when notice of the proceedings against an order of discharge is served, and thus, their validity may have expired.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court was that the impugned orders dated 21st October 2023 and 4th November 2024 are hereby quashed and set aside. The High Court will decide the revision application without being influenced by any observations made in this judgment. It is open for the first respondent-NCT of Delhi, and the fifth respondent to apply before the High Court for giving necessary priority to the disposal of the revision application. The court directed the appellant to appear before the Sessions Court within four weeks from today and furnish bail effective till disposal of the revision application on such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Sessions Court.

The case involves an investigation report against the second accused, who is alleged to have misused their authority by sanctioning grants of fishing rights on an upset price instead of through a tender process as required by the State's policy.
The accused allegedly deviated from the policy without orders from the Chief Minister or Cabinet, but there is no allegation of demand and acceptance of bribe against the second accused.
The investigation report does not contain any evidence to attract the ingredients of the provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act for the second accused.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned Counsel for the appellant argued that there is no material available from the investigation report, pre-charge statements recorded from the complainant or police officers, or even statements of persons questioned by the investigation team to attract the ingredients of the provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act against the second accused.
The Counsel also pointed out that the accusation of misuse of authority does not come under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and that there is no allegation of demand or acceptance of bribe or any illegal gratification against the second accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that even if the grants have been made in non-tribal areas, the ingredients of the offences alleged under the Prevention of Corruption Act are absent for the second accused.
The Court also noted that there is not even an iota of material available from the investigation report to attract the ingredients of the provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act against the second accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal and directed that the proceedings initiated against the second accused be dropped.
The Court made it clear that its observations with respect to the first accused were only to emphasize that even such an accusation is not available as against the appellant herein.
The appeal thus stands allowed, and pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.

The case involves the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and its WTE project. The MCD established a Waste-to-Energy (WTE) project on Design, Build, Finance, and Operate basis. The project was to generate electricity from waste generated in the city. However, the Discoms, who were supposed to procure the entire power generated by the WTE project, challenged the tariff adopted by the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
- The APTEL had failed to consider all relevant factors while making its decision.
- The APTEL had erred in treating the MCD as a total stranger and not considering its ownership of the WTE project.
- The DERC had granted approval for the tariff after considering various factors, including Rule 15 of the SWM Rules 2016 and the financial evaluation report sent by the Bidding Evaluation Committee.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The APTEL had failed to take into consideration all relevant aspects of the matter, including the ownership of the WTE project and the public interest involved in the disposal of waste generated in Delhi.
- The APTEL's decision was based on a hyper-technical ground, which was not justified in the context of the case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned common final judgment and order of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL), and affirmed the orders of the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC). The court held that the APTEL had erred in its decision-making process and failed to consider all relevant factors. The judgment stated that the MCD was not a total stranger, as it owned the WTE project and had established it to perform its statutory obligations.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by an accused who was convicted under Section 302 r/w 34 IPC for the murder of a person. The accused was acquitted of charges under Section 25/27 of the Arms Act, arising out of the same crime. The accused had undergone a sentence of 13 years 6 months and 20 days without remission and a total sentence of 17 years 1 month and 9 days.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court include:

*   The accused was acquitted of charges under Section 25/27 of the Arms Act, indicating that there was no premeditation in the commission of the crime.
*   The accused had good conduct during his period of incarceration and had undergone more than 14 years of sentence without remission.
*   The accused belonged to a poor economic background and had been taking care of his family, indicating a possibility of reformation.
*   The object of punishment is not only to deter the accused from committing further crimes but also to reform and retribute.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

*   The court considered various factors, including the sudden provocation that led to the commission of the crime, the absence of premeditation, and the good conduct of the accused during his period of incarceration.
*   The court noted that the accused had undergone a significant portion of the sentence without remission, indicating that he had served a substantial part of the punishment.
*   The court considered the possibility of reformation in the case of the accused, given his background and conduct during his period of incarceration.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:

*   The sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to the accused was modified to the period already undergone by the accused.
*   The accused shall pay the fine amount imposed by the Sessions Court, if not paid already.
*   The bail bond executed by the accused stands discharged.
*   The Criminal Appeal stood partly allowed to the extent indicated above.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FINDINGS>
The case involves an appeal regarding the heritability of a tenancy under the West Bengal Premises (Rent Control) Rules, 1995. 
</FINDINGS>

<FACTS>
Sh. S.K. Mitra was a tenant who passed away in 1970. The appellants, Smt. Usha Mitra and others, jointly inherited the tenancy from Sh. S.K. Mitra in the year 2000.
The new West Bengal Premises (Rent Control) Rules, 1995 came into force on December 31, 1996.
The new rules provided for a restriction on heritability of tenancies, limiting it to five years from the date of death or from the date of coming into force of the new Act, whichever is later.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellants argued that their tenancy did not expire in 2006 due to the introduction of the 1997 Act, as there was no clear and unequivocal intention in the 1997 Act to have a retrospective operation.
The Division Bench's interpretation of the statutory provision would not make the law retrospective and take away the heritable rights of the tenant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that statutory laws operate prospectively, unless there is a clear intention shown by the legislature for retrospective application.
In the absence of such an intention, the Division Bench's interpretation was deemed to be incorrect.
The court also observed that the legislature can restrict heritability by amending or repealing the law but must do so clearly and unambiguously in the statute itself.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were allowed, and the orders of the Single Judge and the Division Bench were set aside. The court held that Smt. Usha Mitra and the appellants jointly inherited the tenancy from Sh. S.K. Mitra in 1970, and their tenancy did not expire in 2006 due to the introduction of the 1997 Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquittal of the appellants on charges leveled against them. The High Court had reversed the decision of acquittal, but this decision was later set aside by the Supreme Court. The circumstances in the case were found to be far from conclusive, and a conclusion of guilt could not be drawn from them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in the case is that the High Court erred in reversing the decision of acquittal without arriving at any finding of illegality or perversity or error in the reasoning of the Trial Court. The appellants' counsel argued that even on a fresh appreciation of evidence, it was not possible to agree with the findings of the High Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court include the importance of following the principles of circumstantial evidence as laid down in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra. The court noted that the circumstances must be fully established, consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt, and must exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned order and judgment of the High Court, restoring the decision of acquittal by the Trial Court. The appellants were acquitted from all charges leveled against them, and they were directed to be released forthwith if lying in custody.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute related to the dishonour of a cheque. The respondent-accused was accused of issuing a cheque for Rs. 1,00,000 but had insufficient funds in their account. The trial court acquitted the respondent-accused, and the appeal was filed before the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appeal argued that the concurrent findings of acquittal by the trial court and the High Court were bereft of any merits and did not call for any interference from this court. It relied on various principles to justify non-interference, including:
- The principle of non-interference in cases where the concurrent findings are based on a detailed appraisal of evidence.
- The absence of perversity or lack of evidence in the case of the respondent-accused.
- The requirement for interference only when the trial court adopts an incorrect approach in framing issues of fact, and the appellate court fails to appreciate the evidence produced by the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed that the appeal had no merits and did not warrant any interference from this court. The concurrent findings of acquittal were based on a detailed appraisal of evidence and were bereft of perversity or lack of evidence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the findings of the High Court in the impugned judgment dated 03.03.2023. The pending applications, if any, also stood disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a power purchase agreement (PPA) between the appellant and respondents. The respondent was to commission a solar project within 24 months from the date of commencement, but due to delays in land use conversion, the project could not be completed on time. The appellant granted an extension of six months, considering individual facts and circumstances.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties are as follows:

* Appellant: 
  - The delay was attributable to the respondents and did not fall under the force majeure clause or Article 8.3(b)(i) notice requirement.
  - Force majeure does not apply in this case.
* Respondents:
  - The delay was due to government-approved land use conversion, which is a long and arduous process.
  - They acted diligently and with care and caution to secure approvals.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The APTEL has primarily decided a question of fact regarding the attributability of the delay.
* The government's direction to DISCOMs to set up committees to consider each request for extension shows that the appellant accepted that the respondents were entitled to the benefit of Article 2.5 read with Article 8.3 of the PPA.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court has held as follows:

* The APTEL's findings regarding the attributability of the delay and the applicability of the force majeure clause are neither illegal nor unreasonable.
* No substantial question of law arises in this case.
* The appeals are dismissed, and the direction to pay late payment surcharge on the difference amount is upheld.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of two individuals, A-1 and A-2, under sections 11 and 12 of the POCSO Act, for allegedly committing an act of sexual harassment against a minor girl. The Special Court had recorded their conviction, which was later affirmed by the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the actions attributed to A-1 fall within the purview of 'sexual harassment' under section 11 of the POCSO Act. However, the evidence presented was marred by inadequacies and contradictions, which raised reasonable suspicion about A-1's involvement in any criminal act.
For A-2, the prosecution argued that he was guilty of criminal intimidation punishable under section 506 of I.P.C., based on his overt act attributed to him. However, the case against him did not justify a conviction under this section.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The evidence led in the case has been characterized as 'half-baked' and 'marred by inadequacies and contradictions'. The victim's account appears muddled and prevaricated, making it difficult to rely solely on her testimony. 
A strict scrutiny of the evidence is required in cases where a victim's sole testimony is relied upon for conviction.
The case highlights the importance of ensuring that the rights of accused individuals are protected while also considering the gravity of allegations against them.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The bench consisting of DIPANKAR DATTA, K.V. VISWANATHAN, and SANDEEP MEHTA set aside the conviction of A-1 and A-2 as recorded by the Special Court and affirmed by the High Court. They acquitted both appellants and ordered their immediate release from custody.
The bench held that the circumstances on which the conclusion of guilt was to be drawn were not fully established, making it impossible to secure a conviction under section 11 read with section 12 of the POCSO Act for A-1. For A-2, the prosecution failed to prove that his conduct was a case of criminal intimidation punishable under section 506 of I.P.C.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a conviction under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder. The appellant was found guilty by both the Trial Court and the High Court, and the appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed. The evidence presented included eyewitness testimony, medical evidence, and the recovery of the weapon used in the crime.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that the appellant's old age and medical condition should be considered as grounds for leniency or reduction of sentence. They also raised the issue of parity with other cases, suggesting that the sentence was excessive compared to similar crimes. Additionally, they pointed out that the minimum sentence under Section 302 IPC is life imprisonment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the crime was committed with intent to target vital organs and in a group setting, reflecting a level of intent and cruelty that demands an appropriate punitive response. The Court also noted that the offence occurred in a context of political rivalry, which exacerbates its gravity and has far-reaching consequences.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court upheld the conviction and sentence under Section 302 IPC, rejecting the appeal for reduction of sentence. The Court held that the minimum sentence of life imprisonment is justified due to the nature of the offence and its societal implications. The Court also emphasized the need to uphold the rule of law and ensure accountability for such violent acts.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the maintainability of an application for grant of anticipatory bail by an accused who is already in judicial custody in a different offence. The respondent accused had filed an application for anticipatory bail, and the question arose as to whether such an application was maintainable under the scheme of the CrPC.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by Mr. Luthra on behalf of the appellant were:
- The issue at hand has already been dealt with and decided by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra).
- An anticipatory bail application filed by an accused in a different case, while he is in custody in one case, would not be maintainable.
However, the court was unable to agree with such submissions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed:
- The crux of the grievance of the Petitioners in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra) was that although they had secured an order of bail in one case yet they were being detained in prison on the strength of a production warrant in another matter.
- This, according to the petitioners, was violative of Article 21 as they were deprived of their liberty despite having been granted bail in one of the cases.
The court noted that this judgment had no occasion to go into the question of maintainability of an application for grant of anticipatory bail by an accused who is already in judicial custody in relation to some offence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held:
- The present appeal must fail, and the same is thereby dismissed.
- The High Court of Judicature at Bombay shall now proceed to decide the anticipatory bail application filed by the respondent accused on its own merits.
- Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
- The Registry shall forward one copy each of this judgment to all the High Courts across the country.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the Bank and the accused persons regarding a loan transaction. The accused persons had availed a loan, and after some issues arose, they were charged under Section 307 IPC. However, it was later revealed that the parties had settled their disputes through an OTS (One-Time Settlement) of Rs.3,80,00,000/-.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the criminal proceedings against them should be quashed as they had settled their disputes with the Bank and there was no likelihood of conviction. They also pointed out that the dispute involved predominantly civil aspects and continued prosecution would cause oppression and prejudice to the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court initially refused to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC, but this Court later took into consideration various factors including the intervention of village elders and the parties' decision to live peacefully in the future. This view has been consistently followed by this Court in similar cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed, and the impugned judgment and order dated 1st September 2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad for the State of Telangana and the State of Andhra Pradesh in Criminal Petition No. 5778 of 2016 were quashed and aside. The criminal proceedings against the appellants in C.C. No. 16 of 2014 on the file of Principal Special Judge for CBI Cases, Nampally, Hyderabad was also quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a conviction of the appellant for murder, and the appeal is against the judgment and order of the High Court as well as the trial court. The prosecution's case is based on several circumstances, including the recovery of incriminating articles from the accused's premises.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the prosecution include:
- The recovery of incriminating articles such as a blood-stained knife and a mangalsutra from the accused's premises.
- The presence of blood stains on the accused's clothes, which were allegedly found at the crime scene.
- A motive for the crime, which was based on a family dispute.

The arguments presented by the defense include:
- That the recovery of incriminating articles is dubious and does not prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
- That the presence of blood stains on the accused's clothes can be explained by his own account of being present at the crime scene to inform the police about the incident.
- That the motive for the crime is insufficient to establish the accused's guilt, and that a conviction cannot be based solely on a strong suspicion.

The arguments presented by the court include:
- The importance of proving the prosecution's case beyond reasonable doubt, as per the principles of Indian law.
- The need to consider all possible hypotheses and rule out the accused's guilt before convicting him.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:
- That the place where the accused had taken the police party to show where he had concealed the incriminating article was already within the knowledge of the police.
- That it is difficult to believe that, in flowing water where two swimmers were required to find out the incriminating material, the said article would remain at the same place after 3 days.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
- The appeal is allowed.
- The judgment and order of the High Court dated 23rd July 2019 in Confirmation Case No. 2 of 2016 and the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 26th August 2016 and 31st August 2016 passed by the trial court in Sessions Case No. 64 of 2013 are quashed and set aside.
- The appellant is directed to be set at liberty if not required in any other case.

The judgment further states that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and that a conviction cannot be based solely on a strong suspicion or motive.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a respondent who filed an application for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. in connection with a trial number S.C. No. 61/2014, which has been pending for eleven years after the incident occurred. The respondent had earlier filed applications that were rejected by the court, but then supported by the state in this appeal without providing any valid justification.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that the earlier investigation was lacking in credibility and required further investigation to ensure justice is served. The state initially opposed all the applications up to the High Court but later turned turtle and supported the respondent in this appeal without providing any tenable justification for the lack of credibility in the earlier investigation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that both parties have contributed to the delay in the trial, which has been ongoing for eleven years. The court also notes that some frivolous and vexatious proceedings are being filed with no inhibition, which is affecting the rule of law and adding to pendency and consequential delay in other cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court sets aside the judgment of the High Court dated 30.04.2021 allowing further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. Consequently, Cr. M.P. No 40/2020 filed by the respondent before the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge for further investigation stands dismissed. The additional charge sheet dated 02.12.2021 will not be taken on record.
The court also directs that after hearing arguments of parties afresh, the trial should be concluded and judgment pronounced within eight weeks from today.

The petitioners/accused had sold nitrous oxide to Accused 3 & 4 without producing a license. 
Accused No.3 firm was given permission for manufacturing of nitrous oxide.
A license was also granted to the petitioner/A5 firm to manufacture Nitrous Oxide.
The petitioners/accused have sold the drug in contravention of the Act and Rules.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
There is no application of mind even for the namesake by the learned Magistrate while issuing the process.
The High Court has misdirected itself in the present matter by interpreting Section 3(f) of the Act without considering its plain nature.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The impugned judgment and order is liable to be quashed and set aside due to lack of application of mind.
The learned Single Judge of the High Court presumed that there was an order of issuance of process, which is unsustainable in law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed.
The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at Amravati in Criminal Petition No. 4148 of 2018 is quashed and set aside.
The summoning order dated 20th January 2018 passed by the Trial Court in C.C. No. 71 of 2018 and the proceedings arising therefrom are also quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a child victim who was subjected to forcible and violent sexual assault, followed by strangulation and killing. The accused was charged with the crime.
The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to prove the guilt of the accused.
The court examined the testimonies of witnesses but failed to expound upon the inferences derivable therefrom.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the chain of incriminating circumstances required to bring home the guilt of the accused was complete and consistent only with his guilt.
The prosecution relied on the five golden principles (Panchsheel) laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda to prove the guilt of the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the manner in which the evidence was scrutinized lacked depth and rigor, raising concerns about the adequacy of the evaluative process undertaken to arrive at the decisions.
The court observed that the prosecution had succeeded in constructing an unbroken chain of circumstances that irrefutably establishes the culpability of the accused to the exclusion of any other hypothesis.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the prosecution has been able to prove the guilt of the accused by fulfilling the five golden principles (Panchsheel) laid down by the court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda.
The court concluded that the circumstances present before it established conclusively only one hypothesis, which was the guilt of the accused.
The death sentence awarded to the appellant has been rendered otiose since he has passed away.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a public servant who accepted a bribe in exchange for not performing an official act. The bribe amount was recovered from the respondent, and the trial court convicted him. The High Court acquitted the respondent, but the Supreme Court set aside the acquittal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the respondent accepted the bribe as a motive or reward for not performing an official act, which is covered under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The defense argued that the amount was trivial and did not constitute a corrupt practice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the value of gratification should be considered in proportion to the act sought or performed. It also noted that the High Court's view that the bribe amount was trivial and did not constitute corruption is unsustainable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that once the aspects of "demand" and "acceptance" of the bribe amount are established beyond doubt, no two views are possible in the matter. It set aside the acquittal passed by the High Court and restored the judgment and order passed by the trial court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant, a Christian, who claims to be a Hindu for the purpose of availing Scheduled Caste (SC) reservation in employment. The appellant has been baptized and regularly attends church, but still identifies as a Hindu to avail SC benefits.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the respondent (not explicitly mentioned, but implied through the judgment) are:
* The purpose of conversion should be genuine, not for deriving benefits of reservation.
* The appellant's dual claim of being a Christian and identifying as a Hindu is untenable.
* The conferment of SC communal status to the appellant would defeat the social ethos of the policy of reservation and amount to fraud on the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
* India is a secular country, guaranteeing every citizen's right to practise and profess a religion of their choice under Article 25 of the Constitution.
* The appellant's evidence clearly demonstrates their active practice of Christianity, including attending church regularly.
* The case highlights the importance of genuine intent behind conversion for availing benefits like reservation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismisses the appeal, stating that:
* The appellant's dual claim is untenable and they cannot continue to identify as a Hindu after baptism.
* Conferment of SC communal status to the appellant would go against the object of reservation and amount to fraud on the Constitution.
* There is no order as to costs, and pending application(s) shall stand closed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by respondent no. 2 against the appellant under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 376 (rape), Section 420 (cheating), and Sections 504 and 506 (criminal intimidation). The FIR was registered on August 15, 2017, with the Kharghar Police Station in Navi Mumbai. The complainant alleged that she had a long-term consensual relationship with the appellant, but he subsequently discontinued financial support to her. She claimed that this discontinuance constituted a resiling from his promise to marry her.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court's analysis and arguments are as follows:

*   The court notes that there was a prolonged physical relationship between the complainant and the appellant, lasting for about nine years.
*   The court infers that there was no false promise made by the appellant to marry the complainant, which would have vitiated her consent under Section 376 IPC.
*   The court observes that discontinuing financial support rather than resiling from a promise to marry appears to be the triggering point for making the allegation.
*   The court expresses concern about the trend of criminalizing consensual relationships turning sour by invoking criminal jurisprudence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court's observations are as follows:

*   The court notes that every case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances, considering human relationships and psychology which are dynamic and unpredictable.
*   The court observes that allowing the criminal proceeding to continue where no criminal liability can be attached would amount to an abuse of the process of the court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:

*   The court allows the appeal, setting aside the impugned judgement and order passed by the Bombay High Court in Criminal Writ Petition (CRWP) No. 5190 of 2017.
*   The FIR being CR No. 302 of 2017 dated August 15, 2017, registered against the appellant with the Kharghar Police Station, Navi Mumbai under Sections 376, 420, 504 and 506 of the IPC is quashed.
*   The court makes it clear that quashing the FIR against the appellant will not bar respondent no. 2 from seeking any other remedy available under the law.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the admission of a GPA (General Power of Attorney) in evidence despite being insufficiently stamped. The Trial Court failed to apply its judicial mind when admitting the document, and subsequently, the High Court set aside this order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellant: 
- The Trial Court's failure to apply its judicial mind was a critical error that allowed an unstamped document to be admitted in evidence.
- The High Court erred by setting aside the Trial Court's order without considering the statutory provisions governing stamp duty.

Respondent:
- Section 58 of the 1957 Act allows for the admission of instruments without stamps if certain conditions are met.
- The Trial Court's order was not an exercise of its inherent power, as argued by the Appellant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
- The Trial Court recognized its failure to apply judicial mind and exercised its inherent power under section 151, CPC to set aside the original order admitting the GPA without stamps.
- The legislature has placed a responsibility on courts to ensure that stamp duty is paid for instruments, with provisions like Section 33 of the 1957 Act aiming to prevent abuse of process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court:
- Held that the Trial Court's order was an exercise of its inherent power under section 151, CPC to prevent abuse of the process of court and ensure justice.
- Affirmed the restoration of the Trial Court's original order admitting the GPA without stamps due to the absence of a judicial determination at the time of admission.
- Emphasized the importance of courts upholding the sanctity of legal frameworks governing stamp duty to maintain authenticity and enforceability of instruments.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal regarding bail granted to the appellant under the NDPS Act. The appellant was implicated in a case based on statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act, which were found to be inadmissible due to a decision by the Supreme Court in Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court granted bail to the appellant on two grounds: 
1. The statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act were inadmissible, and
2. Reliance was placed on the decision in paragraph 15 of the case Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.
However, the High Court imposed all the conditions mentioned in paragraph 15 of the decision in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The condition of obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission and dropping a pin on Google Maps was deemed to be impossible for the accused to comply with. If the Embassy/High Commission records adverse reasons for denying the certificate, the Court can consider these while considering an application for dispensing with the condition.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court directs that the two conditions in the order granting bail to the appellant - obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission and dropping a pin on Google Maps - shall stand deleted. The case is listed for passing final orders after considering the compliances made by the appellant.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the question of whether towers and pre-fabricated buildings (PFBs) are considered as "inputs" under Rule 2(k) of the CENVAT Rules, which would qualify them for credit benefits. The Assessee, represented by Vodafone and Bharti Airtel, argued that these structures are indeed inputs used for providing mobile telecommunication services.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Assessee's argument was based on Rule 2(k) of the CENVAT Rules, which defines "input" as all goods, except light diesel oil, high speed diesel oil, motor spirit, commonly known as petrol and motor vehicles, used for providing any output service. The Assessees argued that towers and PFBs are indispensable for the effective functioning of antennas, by which radio signals are received and transmitted, and thus used for providing mobile telephonic services to subscribers.

The CESTAT rejected this argument, observing that towers are immovable structures and therefore non-marketable and non-excisable. The CESTAT relied on Explanation-2 to Rule 2(k), which provides that input includes goods used in the manufacture of capital goods which are further used in the factory of the manufacturer.

The Delhi High Court, however, disagreed with the CESTAT's view, holding that towers and PFBs are "goods" and not immovable property, and that they are used for providing mobile telecommunication services. The court relied on sub-clause (ii) of Rule 2(k), which clearly provides that input means all goods, except light diesel oil, high speed diesel oil, motor spirit, commonly known as petrol and motor vehicles, used for providing any output service.

The Supreme Court, in a subsequent decision, upheld the view of the Delhi High Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations from the case include:

* The definition of "input" under Rule 2(k) is broad enough to encompass goods used for providing any output service, including immovable structures like towers and PFBs.
* The distinction between movable and immovable property is not relevant in determining whether an item is considered as input.
* The fact that towers are indispensable for the effective functioning of antennas, which transmit radio signals, supports their classification as inputs.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that towers and PFBs are indeed "inputs" under Rule 2(k) for the purpose of credit benefits under the CENVAT Rules. The court upheld the view of the Delhi High Court, which had disagreed with the CESTAT's rejection of this argument.

The court observed that the definition of input in Rule 2(k) is clear and unambiguous, and that it encompasses all goods used for providing any output service, regardless of whether they are movable or immovable. The court further noted that the distinction between movable and immovable property is not relevant in determining whether an item is considered as input.

The Supreme Court's decision has significant implications for the telecom industry, allowing operators to claim credit benefits on their inputs used for providing mobile telecommunication services.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellant was involved in a terror funding case, and his bail application was rejected by the court. The Appellant had gone to Srinagar with Accused No.3 and Harpreet Singh @ Happy, where they allegedly purchased weapons. The Appellant's disclosure statement corroborated the statements of Accused No.3 and Harpreet Singh @ Happy.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant's counsel argued that:
* The Appellant had not received any funds or incriminating materials were not recovered from his mobile phone, which absolves him of his role in the crime.
* The name of the Appellant does not find place in the terror funding chart.
* The mere fact that the trial has been delayed for five years is a ground to grant bail, citing the case of KA Najeeb (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The material on record prima facie indicates the complicity of the accused as part of the conspiracy.
* The Appellant was knowingly facilitating the commission of a preparatory act towards the commission of a terrorist act under Section 18 of the UAP Act.
* The trial is already underway, and 22 witnesses including protected witnesses have been examined.
* If the Appellant is released on bail, there is every likelihood that he will influence key witnesses in the case, which might hamper the process of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court rejected the bail application of the Appellant and stated that any observation made in the judgment shall not be construed as an expression on the merits of the matter before the trial court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant against the findings of the Trial Court and the High Court. The Trial Court had convicted the appellant for a crime, and the High Court had upheld the conviction. The appellant was granted bail on April 2, 2012, but this order is now to be vacated.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The appellant's defense against the charges of murder
* The prosecution's evidence and witnesses' testimonies that led to the conviction
* The High Court's upholding of the Trial Court's decision
* The court's rejection of the appellant's claim that the case is not one of murder, but rather culpable homicide not amounting to murder
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The nature of the weapon used and the number of gunshots fired at the deceased suggest a premeditated act
* The fact that the appellant was determined to kill the deceased is evident from the evidence presented
* The case does not meet the criteria for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, as per the Indian Penal Code (IPC)
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The appeal is dismissed
* The interim order granting bail to the appellant stands vacated
* The appellant is directed to surrender before the trial court within four weeks from the date of the judgment
* A copy of the judgment shall be sent to the Trial Court to ensure that the appellant surrenders and undergoes the remaining part of his sentence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction of a 74-year-old appellant under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The incident took place in 1992, and the appellant was accused of firing at a fleeing group of people. One person was injured by the first shot, and the second shot resulted in the death of a 10-year-old boy.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellant had intentionally fired at the fleeing group, intending to cause harm or death. The defense argued that the firing was not intentional and that the death of the child was unintentional.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that even if it were assumed that the appellant had no intention to cause death, the doctrine of transfer of malice under Section 301 of the IPC would still apply. The court noted that the firing took place in a commercial locality and that the appellant's actions constituted murder under Section 302 of the IPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court partially allowed the appeal, modifying the conviction from Section 302 to Section 304 Part-I of the IPC. The sentence was reduced to the period already undergone, taking into account the year of the incident and the age of the appellant as on date (74 years).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an accused appellant who was convicted of charges related to a crime. The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence, including the discovery of incriminating articles and DNA profiling. The Investigating Officer (PW-22) testified about the recovery of currency notes from the accused's house, but did not mention the accused leading them to the crime scene. Other witnesses, including Dr. Syed Irshad and pancha witnesses, also failed to link the accused to the discovery of incriminating articles.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the circumstantial evidence established a clear link between the accused and the crime. They relied on the testimony of the Investigating Officer (PW-22) and other witnesses to prove that the accused led them to the crime scene and made incriminating disclosures. The DNA profiling report was also presented as an additional link in the chain of circumstantial evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Judges observed that none of the incriminating circumstances portrayed by the prosecution were established by cogent and clinching evidence. They noted that the Investigating Officer (PW-22) did not mention the accused leading them to the crime scene, and other witnesses failed to link the accused to the discovery of incriminating articles.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Judges held that none of the incriminating circumstances against the accused were established by cogent and clinching evidence. They quashed and set aside the impugned judgments dated 13th October, 2016 and 20th March, 2019, and acquitted the accused appellant of the charges. The appeal was allowed accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the accused persons and a Bank regarding a loan transaction. The FIR and chargesheet pertain to this dispute, which was settled through an Out of the System (OTS) payment of Rs.3,80,00,000/- by the borrowers to the Bank. After receiving the OTS amount, the Bank closed the loan account. Both appellants are wives of Accused Nos. 1 and 2, with specific roles attributed in the chargesheet pertaining only to Accused No.1.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the appellants argued that since the dispute was predominantly civil in nature, the High Court should have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC to quash the criminal proceedings. The High Court had refused to exercise this jurisdiction initially but later granted it after considering various factors, including intervention by village elders and a decision to live peacefully.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's refusal to quash the proceedings initially was based on the fact that a serious offence under Section 307 IPC was involved. However, the Court later considered the settlement between the parties, the remote and bleak possibility of conviction, and the oppression and prejudice it would cause if the criminal proceedings continued.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashing and setting aside the impugned judgment and order dated 1st September 2017. The criminal proceedings against the appellants in C.C. No. 16 of 2014 were also quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of the Division Bench of the High Court, which set aside the arbitral award dated 03.06.2005.
The matter pertains to the interpretation of Clause 51 and its applicability in a contractual dispute.
The arbitral tribunal had interpreted Clause 51 in a reasonable manner based on the evidence on record.
The learned Single Judge exercising jurisdiction under Section 34 of the 1996 Act affirmed this interpretation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that:
* The respondent (appellant before the Division Bench) challenged the arbitral award, arguing that its interpretation of Clause 51 was opposed to public policy and contained patent illegality.
* The petitioner (respondent in the appeal before this Court) argued that the arbitral tribunal had correctly interpreted Clause 51 based on the evidence on record.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed:
* That frequent interference with arbitral awards would defeat the very purpose of the 1996 Act.
* That a great deal of restraint is required to be shown while examining the validity of an arbitral award when such an award has been upheld, wholly or substantially, under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
* The Division Bench's order setting aside the arbitral award is hereby set aside.
* The arbitral award dated 03.06.2005 is restored.
* Consequently, the appeal is allowed.
* There shall be no order as to cost.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the acquittal of accused appellants in a criminal trial. The prosecution relied on the evidence of the Investigating Officer (PW-27) and some witnesses, but the trial court had already acquitted the accused due to lack of sufficient evidence.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the prosecution were based on the disclosure statements made by the accused, which allegedly led to the recovery of various weapons. However, the Investigating Officer (PW-27) failed to provide a detailed description of the conversation leading to the recording of these statements.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that neither the disclosure memos were proved in accordance with law nor was there any corroboration to the vacillating evidence of the witnesses. The FIR (Exhibit P-10) was also found to be a post-investigation document, casting doubt on the entire prosecution case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allowed the appeal and acquitted the accused appellants of all charges. The High Court's judgment reversing the trial court's acquittal was held to be unsustainable and was reversed. The bail bonds of the accused were discharged, and they were directed not to surrender.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and other private bus operators filed appeals against the High Court's decision denying the delegation power of the State Transport Authority (STA). The STA wanted to delegate its functions for issuing non-stage carriage permits, including contract carriage, special, tourist, and temporary permits.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:

* The power of the STA to delegate the issuance of contracts was supported by Section 68(5) of the Motor Vehicles Act (MV Act) and Rule 56(1)(d) of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules (KMV Rules).
* Delegation is a rational and necessary administrative measure for efficient processing of permit applications without undermining the oversight function of the STA.
* The High Court's reasoning on non-delegability was flawed, and the power to delegate remained intact.

The respondents argued that:

* Delegation would lead to undue delays and inefficiencies in the permit-issuance process, disrupting the balance of public transport service delivery.
* Legislative intent and practical necessity supported the delegation of routine permit-granting powers.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
If the STA's delegation power was not allowed, it could:

* Overload the STA with routine functions
* Cause undue delays in permit-issuance
* Disrupt public transport service delivery

The delegation of routine permit-granting powers is legally permissible and necessary for efficient public transport administration.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

* Section 3 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation and Certain Other Law (Amendment) Act, 2003, which repeals the Karnataka Contract Carriages (Acquisition) Act, 1976, is constitutional.
* The STA possesses the power to delegate its functions under Section 68(5) of the MV Act, as expressly provided by the statute and further clarified by Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules.
* The appeals filed by the private bus operators and the Karnataka State Road Transport Authority are allowed, and the impugned orders of the High Court denying delegation power are set aside.

The Secretary of the STA is empowered to grant non-stage carriage permits (including contract carriage, special, tourist, and temporary permits) in accordance with Section 68(5) of the MV Act and Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a prosecution against an appellant who was granted protection under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and accused of certain offenses related to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The High Court allowed the appeal, and the trial court's proceedings were quashed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented in favor of the appellant:
* Lack of sanction for prosecution by the competent authority under Section 197 of the CrPC
* Competent authority refused to grant sanction for the prosecution of the appellant

Arguments against the appellant (not explicitly mentioned):
* Arguments based on "deemed sanction" were raised, but this concept is not recognized in Section 197 of the CrPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court:
* The competent authority refused to grant sanction for the prosecution of the appellant
* The High Court erred in not considering the fact that the sanction for prosecution was not granted by the competent authority under Section 197 of the CrPC
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court:
"The appeal is therefore allowed in the aforesaid terms. The chargesheet, the summoning order and the consequent steps, if any, taken by the trial court pursuant to the same are liable to be quashed qua the appellant herein and are thus quashed."
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a criminal proceeding against the appellants under FIR RC No.13(E)/2008-CBI, BS & FC, Mumbai. The chargesheet has been filed and the Appellants have settled with the Bank prior to the filing of the chargesheet.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the Appellants are as follows:
- The criminal case against them has an overwhelming and pre-dominant civil character arising out of pure commercial transaction where the parties have resolved their entire dispute amongst themselves.
- The allegations against the Bank Manager relating to his involvement in the commission of offences, which has been alleged against the Appellants, having not been substantiated, the possibility of conviction of the appellants is remote and bleak.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court are as follows:
- The stage and timing of the settlement play a crucial role in determination as to whether to exercise power under Section 482 of the CrPC 1973 or not.
- Cases where settlement has arrived at either immediately or in close vicinity after the alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under investigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal proceeding/investigation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the Court is as follows:
- The impugned order dated 05.05.2017 passed by the High Court is hereby quashed and set aside.
- As a consequence thereof, the criminal proceedings against the Appellants and arising out of FIR RC No.13(E)/2008-CBI, BS & FC, Mumbai are quashed.
- The appeal is allowed.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over forest land, with the plaintiff claiming ownership and seeking a declaration of title and permanent injunction. The lands in question were declared as private lands under the A.P. Land Revenue Act, 1317 F, but the High Court had earlier given a clear finding that these lands were not shown as private lands by the defendant at the time of declaration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff argued that the suit for relief was maintainable despite the finality of the proceedings under Section 15 of A.P. Forest Act, citing the absence of challenge to the concluded proceedings and lack of specific challenge to the actions taken under the A.P. Land Revenue Act.
The respondent/State argued against the maintainability of the suit, relying on the provisions of the A.P. Forest Act and the finality of the proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's earlier judgment had given a clear finding that the lands were not shown as private lands by the defendant at the time of declaration under the A.P. Land Revenue Act, 1317 F.
The proceedings under Section 15 of A.P. Forest Act had become final and conclusive, and the plaintiff had not challenged these proceedings in their suit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed, and the impugned judgment was set aside by restoring the judgment rendered in A.S. No. 145 of 1994.
Costs of Rs. 5,00,000/- each were imposed on appellants and respondents to be paid to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) within two months from the date of the judgment.
The Contempt Case No. 624 of 2021 pending before the High Court was directed to be closed.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the enforcement of a sale agreement. The agreement was executed in favor of Respondent No.1-buyer, and they deposited Rs.24,61,000/- as sale consideration. However, the Appellant claimed that the agreement cannot be specifically enforced due to certain irregularities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the Appellant argued against the enforcement of the sale agreement due to material irregularities, while the Respondent No.1-buyer likely argued for the enforcement of the agreement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Agreement to Sell cannot be specifically enforced due to certain findings made by the court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is in favor of the Appellant. The Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned Judgment dated 27th April, 2018, as well as decrees dated 10th May, 2018, and 09th May, 2024. The sale deed executed in favor of Respondent No.1-buyer is declared null and void. The Appellant is directed to refund the balance sale consideration amount of Rs.24,61,000/- deposited by Respondent No.1-buyer.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the appellant against respondent no.2 under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The respondent failed to honor a cheque issued for Rs.35 lakhs, leading to a demand notice sent by the appellant. Despite receiving the notice, the respondent did not respond or make any payment, prompting the filing of a complaint.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* The trial court and appellate court had already convicted the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, and imposed a sentence of one year's imprisonment and a fine of Rs.35 lakhs.
* The high court, however, overturned the concurrent findings of guilt and conviction by the lower courts, leading to the appeal filed by the appellant.
* The respondent argued that the complaint was barred by limitation and that there was no proper notice served on him before filing the complaint.
* The appellant contended that the respondent had sufficient knowledge of the cheque being dishonored and that he failed to respond to the demand notice sent by the appellant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed the following points:
* The trial court and appellate court's findings of guilt and conviction were concurrent, making it difficult for the high court to overturn them without sufficient reasons.
* The respondent failed to demonstrate that he had no knowledge of the cheque being dishonored or that the demand notice was not properly served on him.
* The court relied on the precedent set by the Supreme Court in the case of State Bank of India v. T.K. Rajan (2005), which held that it is the duty of the courts to consider carefully and appreciate the totality of the evidence before coming to a conclusion.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment was as follows:

* The appeal filed by the appellant was allowed, and the impugned order was set aside.
* The conviction and sentence imposed upon the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, were restored in part, with a modification that the fine be restricted to Rs.32 lakhs instead of Rs.35 lakhs.
* In view of the respondent's age, the court was inclined to modify the sentence to only payment of a fine and not imprisonment.
* The respondent was given four months from the date of the order to pay the fine of Rs.32 lakhs to the appellant; failing which, the original sentence would be restored with the added modification that the entire fine of Rs.35 lakhs would be payable to the appellant.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a charge of abetment to suicide against the appellants. The deceased had written a suicide note alleging that he was being blackmailed by the appellants and had committed suicide due to this blackmailing.
The appellants were accused of taking money and valuables from the deceased as part of the blackmailing scheme.
The prosecution's case relied heavily on the suicide note, which was sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for examination.
The Deputy Chief Handwriting Expert of FSL opined that the handwriting in the suicide note matched the handwriting of the deceased.
However, the prosecution did not examine the expert as a witness and the records did not indicate that the accused had admitted to the genuineness of the report.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the suicide note was genuine and established the blackmailing scheme perpetrated by the appellants against the deceased.
The prosecution relied on the opinion of the handwriting expert, which matched the handwriting in the suicide note with the handwriting of the deceased.
However, the defense argued that the opinion of the handwriting expert should not be given much weight without corroboration or cross-examination.
The defense also pointed out that there was no direct evidence linking the appellants to the alleged blackmailing scheme.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution's case relied heavily on the suicide note, which was a crucial piece of evidence in establishing the charge against the appellants.
However, the court also noted that the opinion of the handwriting expert should be viewed with caution and required corroboration or cross-examination before it can be accepted as reliable evidence.
The court further observed that there was no direct evidence linking the appellants to the alleged blackmailing scheme, which made it difficult to establish their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 17.12.2013 and of the trial court dated 12.05.2011.
The court held that there was no sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the appellants beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly in the absence of direct evidence linking them to the alleged blackmailing scheme.
Consequently, the bail bonds of the appellants were discharged as they had already been on bail.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a civil appeal concerning the applicability of the moratorium under Section 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to regulatory penalties imposed by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC). The appellant, a homebuyer, was facing delays in possession and breaches of contractual obligations by the respondent, a real estate developer. The NCDRC imposed penalties on the respondent for non-compliance with consumer protection laws.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* Appellant's argument: The moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC should extend to regulatory penalties imposed by the NCDRC, citing the analogy between Section 138, NI Act proceedings and Section 27, CP Act proceedings.
* Counter-argument: The respondent argued that the moratorium does not apply to regulatory penalties imposed for non-compliance with consumer protection laws.

The appellant relied on P. Mohanraj (supra) to support their argument that a moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC extends to proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations from the case include:

* The court held that statutory penalties and regulatory actions do not automatically fall within the ambit of an insolvency moratorium.
* The distinction between debt recovery proceedings and punitive actions needs to be created, and therefore all criminal liabilities do not fall within the scope of the moratorium unless explicitly covered under the IBC.
* The court emphasized that regulatory bodies' actions are taken in the public interest, and penalties imposed cannot be stayed merely because insolvency proceedings are ongoing.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The court dismissed the appeal and directed the appellant to comply with the penalties imposed by the NCDRC within a period of eight weeks from the date of the judgment.
* The court held that the moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC does not extend to regulatory penalties imposed for non-compliance with consumer protection laws.
* Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

The case revolves around a category change application in the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Rules, 2008. The appellant-State has challenged the High Court's judgment regarding the payment of fees for changing the nature of unnotified land.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the Appellant:
* The exemption from paying fees is only intended for lands up to 25 cents in extent.
* The subsequent clarification dated 23rd July 2021 also reiterated this position.
* Rule 12 Clause 9 of the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Rules, 2008 clarifies that when the extent is up to 25 cents no fee is to be remitted.
Arguments presented by the Respondent (High Court's judgment):
* The exemption from paying fees is applicable for all lands up to 25 cents in extent.
* The landowner can submit an affidavit swearing that the property which is sought to be changed by its category is less than 25 cents in its extent.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court:
* The competent authority has found it fit to provide that as on the cut-off date, properties with or without the same survey number, lying as a single unit but covered by different documents can be considered. However, if the total exceeds 25 cents then the benefit of the exemption cannot be allowed.
* It is clear from this that the exemption is only intended for lands up to 25 cents because, had it not been so, the second part of the clarification would be rendered otiose.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court's judgment:
* The appeals are allowed. 
* The judgment of the learned Single Judge as confirmed by the Division Bench is overruled on this count as not having laid down the correct interpretation of the law.
* The respondent must, therefore, pay a conversion fee as calculable on the total extent of land in their ownership.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the execution of a decree for specific performance, with the plaintiff-appellant seeking permission to deposit the balance sale consideration. The facts include:
- A decree of specific performance was awarded by the court.
- The plaintiff-appellant failed to deposit the balance sale consideration within the stipulated time frame.
- The plaintiff-appellant deposited the balance sale consideration in 2019, but this was after a significant delay.
- The defendants-judgment debtors sought interest on the delayed payment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:
- The plaintiff-appellant argued that they should be allowed to deposit the balance sale consideration without penalty, citing their inability to do so earlier due to various reasons.
- The defendants-judgment debtors countered this argument, pointing out that the delay in payment was significant and that interest should be awarded on the delayed amount.
- The court considered the principles of justice and the need for flexibility in procedural matters to achieve substantial justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The court recognized the importance of technical procedures in ensuring the proper administration of justice, but also emphasized that these should not stand in the way of achieving substantive justice.
- The court noted that the delay in filing the execution petition and depositing the balance sale consideration was significant and that interest should be awarded on the delayed amount.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:
- The appeal was allowed, and the impugned order passed by the High Court was set aside.
- The executing court's order was affirmed, and the balance sale consideration deposited by the plaintiff-appellant in 2019 was ordered to be disbursed in favor of the defendants-judgment debtors with interest accumulated thereon within a specified time frame.
- Simple interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from the date of the judgment and order passed by the appellate court till the date the balance consideration was deposited was awarded as compensation for the delay.

<FACTS>
The case involves a trial of Nandkumar Babulal Soni and others on charges under sections 120B and 411 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The accused were allegedly involved in selling stolen gold bars. The seized gold bars were recovered from the premises of Vijaya Bank, where they had been kept for safekeeping.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to establish the identity of the seized property as stolen goods. The trial court found that the possibility of mistaken identification cannot be ruled out due to a delay of four years in recovering the property and a lack of evidence linking the gold bars to M/s. CN, from whom they were allegedly sold.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The prosecution's failure to discharge its initial burden and complete the chain of circumstances against the accused meant that the invocation of Section 114 of the Evidence Act was not permissible. The trial court noted that the weakness in the defence or the accused's failure to substantiate a fact cannot become the strength of the prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Criminal Appeal Nos. 581-583 of 2012 preferred by Nandkumar Babulal Soni are allowed, and his conviction and sentence under sections 120B and 411 of the IPC are set aside. The seized gold bars (205 in number) are to be handed over to the appellant-Nandkumar Babulal Soni. Criminal Appeal No. 584 of 2012 preferred by Vijaya Bank is dismissed, as the identity of the seized property being stolen has not been established.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an election petition in the state of U.P. The appellant was a candidate in the election for the post of 'Pradhan'. There was a disparity in the count of votes informed to the appellant and that finally disclosed in the official form, which raised questions about the veracity of the election and its conduct.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are based on the principles of democracy and the importance of free and fair elections. The appellants argued that each vote has its own value irrespective of its effect in the final outcome of the election, and its sanctity must be protected. They also pointed out that deliberate attempts were made to benefit the ultimate victor, which undermined the integrity of the election process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The court noted that each vote has its own value and its sanctity must be protected.
* It was observed that three out of four candidates had doubts regarding the propriety of the election and supported a recount of votes.
* The court also noted that deliberate attempts were made to benefit the ultimate victor, including the use of police force to remove the appellant from the polling area.
* Additionally, it was observed that important documents pertaining to the election are missing and their absence is unexplained.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the High Court passed in Writ-C No.35734 of 2022 titled Sunil Kumar v. State of U.P. And Ors. dated 27th January 2023 was set aside, and the order dated 31st October 2022 passed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in Election Petition No.02010/2021 was restored.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the execution of a sale deed for a property. The plaintiffs (respondents) entered into an agreement to sell the property to the defendants (appellants) on May 24, 1981, with an advance payment of Rs. 12,000. However, the sale deed was not executed due to various reasons. The respondents claimed that they were ready and willing to execute the sale deed but the appellants refused to do so.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:

* The respondents contended that they were always ready and willing to execute the sale deed, but the appellants delayed the process.
* The appellants argued that the respondents never had the funds available to clear the balance sale consideration and were only interested in blocking the property for resale at a higher price.

The courts below held that the respondents were not genuinely interested in buying the land and were merely acting as middlemen. However, the Supreme Court disagreed with this finding.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The conduct of the respondents throughout gave credence to the appellants' contention that the respondents never had the funds available to clear the balance sale consideration and were only interested in blocking the property for resale at a higher price.
* The value of the property has appreciated significantly over time, from approximately Rs. 4 crores (as estimated by the appellant).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

* The decree of specific performance was not warranted in this case and should have been denied.
* The suit was liable to be dismissed.
* However, considering the facts and circumstances, the court directed the appellants to compensate the respondents for their advance payment (Rs. 12,000) by paying Rs. 24 lakhs.
* Additionally, the appellants were required to pay Rs. 6 lakhs as costs of litigation, totaling Rs. 30 lakhs to be paid within three months from the date of the order.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the accused-appellants, Nusrat Parween/appellant No. 1, Ahmad Khan/appellant No. 2, and Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3, who were charged with an unspecified offense related to Hamida Parween's disappearance. The police station diary entry for Serial No. 517 was not brought on record, which led the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The prosecution failed to prove the chain of incriminating circumstances against the accused-appellants by convincing evidence and beyond doubt. The trial Court and High Court erred in appreciating the evidence and holding that the prosecution had proved the case against the accused-appellants beyond all manner of doubt.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The maternal family relatives of Hamida Parween stated that after her husband's death, the accused persons were continuously quarreling with her for usurping the entire Holding No. 13. The first informant, Md. Firoj/PW4, also alleged in the FIR that the accused persons had quarreled with Hamida Parween in the morning of the incident and were seen fleeing away together in a tempo.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Division Bench of the High Court's judgment dated 19th January, 2011, and judgments and orders dated 25th November, 2003, and 1st December, 2003 passed by the trial Court are hereby reversed and set aside. The accused-appellants, Nusrat Parween/appellant No. 1, Ahmad Khan/appellant No. 2, and Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3, are acquitted of the charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a Third Category of Appeals related to the resolution plan for DHFL. The Appellants, including Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Limited and other lenders, filed appeals against the Adjudicating Authority/NCLT's approval of the Resolution Plan.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties include:
*   The Appellants' contention that the Resolution Plan was not approved in accordance with Section 30(2) of the IBC.
*   The Respondents' argument that the Adjudicating Authority/NCLT had correctly applied the principles of Section 30(2) and approved the Resolution Plan.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed:
*   The Resolution Plan was approved in accordance with the principles of Section 30(2) of the IBC.
*   The Appellants' contentions regarding the approval process were not tenable.
*   The Adjudicating Authority/NCLT had correctly applied the principles of Section 30(2).
</OBSERVATIONS>

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a company (Petitioner) that was in the process of undergoing insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The State of Chhattisgarh (respondents/authorities) raised recovery proceedings against the Petitioner despite the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra v. Union of India (2023), which held that the satisfaction arrived at by the Adjudicating Authority under Section 31 of the Code was vitiated if any claim is not taken into consideration by the Committee of Creditors (CoC).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Petitioner argued that the respondents/authorities proceeded with the recovery proceedings despite being informed about the judgment in Ghanshyam Mishra v. Union of India (2023), which made their actions contemptuous in nature.
The respondents/authorities contended that they were entitled to benefit of doubt and that the State of Chhattisgarh was not a party to the Writ Petition or to the proceedings before the learned NCLT.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the facts in the case of Rainbow Papers Limited (supra) were distinguishable from the present case, as the State Tax Officer had raised the claim before the CoC in the former case.
The Court noted that the respondents/authorities could not have proceeded with the recovery proceedings after being informed about the judgment in Ghanshyam Mishra v. Union of India (2023).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the continuation of the proceedings by the respondents/authorities even after the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) was specifically brought to their notice is contemptuous in nature.
However, the Court did not propose to take any action against the respondents/contemnors and instead quashed and set aside the demand notices issued by them on the Petitioner Company and all proceedings pursuant thereto.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of two individuals, A-1 and A-2, under certain charges. The prosecution's case relies on the testimony of injured witnesses and the investigation officer. However, several discrepancies and inconsistencies have been found in their statements, including:
* Inconsistencies amongst interested witnesses
* Lack of independent witnesses
* Delay in filing the FIR
* Interpolations on record
* Numerous lapses in the investigation
The prosecution's version of events is also not supported by medical and scientific evidence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' counsel argued that:
* The convictions cannot stand due to the lack of credible evidence
* The testimony of injured witnesses and the investigation officer is not reliable
* The prosecution's case relies on interested witnesses with inconsistencies amongst them
* No independent witnesses were examined
* There was a delay in filing the FIR, which raises suspicions about the authenticity of the case
* Interpolations on record and numerous lapses in the investigation further undermine the credibility of the case
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The convictions cannot stand due to the lack of credible evidence
* The testimony of injured witnesses and the investigation officer is not inspiring confidence
* The prosecution's version of events is shaken beyond a point, making no conviction resting thereupon just in the eyes of law
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:
* The appeals are allowed
* The convictions subject to the appeal are set aside
* Both appellants are directed to be released forthwith, if not required in any other case
* Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a complaint filed by the respondent (complainant) against the appellant, alleging commission of an offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC. The FIR was registered on August 15, 2017, at Kharghar Police Station, Navi Mumbai.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* Whether a consensual relationship can be criminalized after turning sour
* Whether the allegations made by the complainant are true and whether there was any false promise of marriage
* Whether the respondent's (complainant's) decision to make an allegation at a belated stage is correct
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made in the case include:
* There is a worrying trend of consensual relationships being criminalized after turning sour, using criminal jurisprudence
* Every case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances, as human relationships and psychology are dynamic and unpredictable
* The court must be mindful of attributing criminal intent to disturbed civil relationships
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is:
* The appeal is allowed and the impugned judgement and order dated 12.02.2018 passed by the Bombay High Court in Criminal Writ Petition (CRWP) No. 5190 of 2017 is set aside
* The FIR being CR No. 302 of 2017 dated 15.08.2017 registered against the appellant with the Kharghar Police Station, Navi Mumbai under Sections 376, 420, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code is quashed
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by a developer against the imposition of regulatory penalties by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC). The NCDRC had imposed penalties on the developer for non-compliance with consumer protection laws. The developer argued that the moratorium under Section 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) applies to regulatory penalties, thus staying their enforcement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's arguments were based on the following points:
- The moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC extends to proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act), which implies that it also applies to regulatory penalties.
- Staying the regulatory penalties would be in the interest of homebuyers, who have already suffered immense delays and financial hardship.
- The legislative intent behind consumer protection laws is to safeguard the interests of consumers and ensure accountability from service providers.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations made by the court include:
- The distinction between debt recovery proceedings and punitive actions needs to be created, and not all criminal liabilities fall within the scope of the moratorium unless explicitly covered under the IBC.
- Penalties imposed by regulatory bodies in the public interest cannot be stayed merely because insolvency proceedings are ongoing.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment states that:
- The penalties imposed by the NCDRC are regulatory in nature and do not constitute "debt" under the IBC.
- The moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC does not extend to regulatory penalties imposed for non-compliance with consumer protection laws.
- The appeal is dismissed, and the appellant is directed to comply with the penalties imposed by the NCDRC within a period of eight weeks from the date of this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against a contempt of court order passed by the High Court. The appellants (now contemnors) were ordered to pay Rs. 10 lakhs as compensation and were also asked to undergo a three-month confinement in civil prison for violating an express order of the Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the contemnors was that they had obtained the undertaking (subsequently made into an order) without any intention to breach it. They also argued that there was no sufficient evidence to prove their guilt and that the High Court's order was harsh and disproportionate.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the contempt of court jurisdiction is a special one, exercised sparingly and with caution, when an act adversely affects the administration of justice or tends to impede its course. The purpose of this jurisdiction is to uphold the majesty and dignity of the courts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court confirmed the High Court's order but modified it to some extent. It deleted the three-month confinement in civil prison, enhanced the compensation from Rs. 10 lakhs to Rs. 13 lakhs, and directed that the amount should carry simple interest @6% from the date of the lower Court's judgment (2nd August 2013).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction and sentence of four individuals accused of abetting the suicide of a deceased person. The prosecution's case was based on a suicide note allegedly written by the deceased, which implicated the appellants in a blackmailing scheme.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the handwriting on the suicide note matched the handwriting of the deceased, and therefore, it was genuine. However, the defense raised several points, including:
* The Deputy Chief Handwriting Expert of the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) did not examine the witnesses in court.
* There was no evidence to prove that the accused had admitted to the report of the handwriting expert.
* The opinion of a handwriting expert is opinion evidence and can rarely replace substantive evidence. Therefore, it needed corroboration either by clear direct evidence or circumstantial evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court included:
* The prosecution did not examine the Deputy Chief Handwriting Expert as an expert witness.
* The records do not indicate that the accused had admitted to the genuineness of the report of the handwriting expert.
* There was no reliable evidence throwing doubt on the opinion of the handwriting expert.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allowed the appeal, setting aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court and the trial court. The court held that even if the suicide note was genuine, there was no act of incitement by the appellants proximate to the date of the deceased's suicide. Therefore, it could not be said that any offence of abetment to commit suicide was made out against the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The election in question took place in 2021. The process of law culminated in this judgment four years later. There was a disparity in the count of votes informed to the appellant and that finally disclosed in the official form, relating to 19 votes (i.e., the difference between 1193 and 1212). The margin of victory of the respondent was 37 votes. Three of the four candidates submitted by way of affidavit that they had doubts regarding the propriety of the election. They would support a recount of votes. Deliberate attempts were made to benefit the ultimate victor, such as the use of police force to remove the appellant from the vicinity of the polling area. The diary of the Presiding Officer of the polling booths could not be found despite a concerted effort.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The argument presented by the parties was that a recount would be justified due to the disparity in the count of votes and the unexplained absence of important documents pertaining to the election. 
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Each vote has its own value, irrespective of its effect in the final outcome of the election. The sanctity of each vote must be protected. If the Presiding Officers' records are missing and cannot be verified, it can be found that the final conclusion is within the realm of questionability.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the High Court passed in Writ-C No.35734 of 2022 titled Sunil Kumar v. State of U.P. And Ors. dated 27th January 2023 was set aside, and the order dated 31st October 2022 passed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in Election Petition No.02010/2021 was restored. The appeal was allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves multiple civil appeals (Civil Appeal Nos. 3957 to 3963 of 2023) filed by different appellants. The facts of the case are not explicitly stated, but it appears that the appellants claimed to be entitled to benefits under the Non-Creamy Layer (NCL) category.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants are not clearly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that they relied on a 2-Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Ram Kumar Gijroya (supra), which is discussed in Section 38.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed that none of the appellants had a valid certificate and/or accompanied by an affidavit as per the proforma at the relevant time. The details of each appellant's certification are provided in Section 37.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the civil appeals, upholding the decision rendered by the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court. The court relied on precedents and provisions of law governing the circumstances before them. No costs were ordered to be paid by either party.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a removal order passed by the Disciplinary Authority against the respondent-employee. The respondent had filed a representation, which was allegedly not considered in the fresh Removal Order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the removal order was justified and based on sufficient evidence. They also contended that the respondent had been given a fair opportunity to present his version and respond to the charges.
The learned counsel for the respondent relied upon the judgments of the learned Single Judge and the Impugned Judgment, which were not relevant to the factual position in this case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Upon a comparative overview of both removal orders, it was observed that there were similarities between them. Although the respondent's representation had been considered in the fresh Removal Order, the court noted that the Disciplinary Authorities could improve by engaging more meaningfully with the representations and submissions of delinquent employees.
The court also pointed out that the respondent had not contested or denied any official documentation related to the charges.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Impugned Judgment was quashed and set aside, and the Removal Order dated 28.09.1993 passed by the Disciplinary Authority was restored.
As an extraordinary indulgence, considering that the respondent had retired and was aged, any payments already made to him in the interregnum would not be recovered by the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an individual who is accused of commissioning offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The individual had filed a bail application, which was rejected by both the Special Court and the High Court. The charge sheet against the individual does not mention any antecedents or connections with any terrorist organization.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defence argued that there were no reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against the individual of commissioning offences under the UAPA was prima facie true. They contended that the charge sheet did not provide sufficient evidence to support the prosecution's claims, and that the individual had not been linked to any terrorist organization.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Special Court and the High Court failed to consider the material in the charge sheet objectively, focusing instead on the activities of PFI. This led to a failure to properly appreciate the individual's case for bail. The defence pointed out that the allegations made by the prosecution were serious but that the duty of the courts is to consider cases for grant of bail in accordance with the law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that there was no reason to reject the bail application filed by the individual. The court set aside the impugned orders and allowed the appeal, directing the Special Court to enlarge the individual on bail until the conclusion of the trial on appropriate terms and conditions.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the power of judicial review in cases of arrest under Special Acts, such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the Customs Act. The court is considering the balance between individual liberty and the interest of justice and society.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the case revolves around the interpretation of the powers granted to authorized officers under Special Acts and the scope of judicial review in such cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court include:
- The power of judicial review is necessary to check and balance the functioning of public authorities.
- However, this power must be exercised cautiously to avoid judicial overreach.
- The provisions contained in Special Acts, such as PMLA and Customs Act, are stringent measures aimed at combating serious crimes affecting the financial systems and national sovereignty.
- Frequent or casual interference by courts may embolden unscrupulous elements to commit crimes and undermine justice for victims.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The powers of judicial review should not be exercised unless there is manifest arbitrariness or gross violation of statutory safeguards provided under Special Acts.
- Authorized officers have been specially conferred with powers to combat serious crimes, and their functioning must be given due respect.
- Minor procedural lapses on the part of authorized officers may not be seen as grounds for judicial review.
- The focus should be on balancing individual liberty with the interest of justice and society in cases under Special Acts.

Judgment: JUDGMENT OF THE COURT
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal by Vihaan Kumar against the State of Haryana and another, challenging the requirement of communicating the grounds of arrest to the person arrested as mandated under Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the provision for communicating the grounds of arrest is not only a formality but also serves the purpose of enabling the detained person to know the reasons for his arrest and provide an opportunity to secure his release at the earliest possible opportunity.
The respondent, on the other hand, contended that the requirement of communicating the grounds of arrest in writing is a constitutional mandate that has been incorporated into the statute under Section 50 of the CrPC (Section 47 of BNSS) and is required to be communicated not only to the arrested person but also to his friends, relatives or such other persons as may be disclosed or nominated by the arrested person.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the purpose of inserting Section 50A of the CrPC, making it obligatory on the person making arrest to inform about the arrest to the friends, relatives or persons nominated by the arrested person, is to ensure that they would be able to take immediate and prompt actions to secure the release of the detained person as permissible under the law.
The Court noted that the requirement of communicating the grounds of arrest in writing is not only a formality but also serves the purpose of enabling the detained person to know the reasons for his arrest and provide an opportunity to secure his release at the earliest possible opportunity.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional mandate of informing the grounds of arrest to the person arrested in writing as required under Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India, Section 50 of the CrPC (Section 47 of BNSS), and Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.
The Court observed that the requirement of communicating the grounds of arrest is not only to inform the arrested person but also to his friends, relatives or such other persons as may be disclosed or nominated by the arrested person.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the quashing of FIRs (First Information Reports) filed against several respondents-accused under the SARFAESI Act. The respondents-accused had filed writ petitions seeking the quashing of the FIRs, which were pending before the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Learned Counsels for the respondents-accused argued that the allegations made in the FIRs are of civil nature and have been given a colour of criminal nature. They submitted that the complaints were filed with ulterior motives after the parties had engaged in proceedings under the SARFAESI Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Three-Judge Bench noted that the High Court's impugned orders passed were in utter disregard and in the teeth of guidelines issued by the court. The court observed that the extraordinary and inherent powers of the court do not confer any arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whims and caprice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Three-Judge Bench set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court, holding that they were not in consonance with the settled legal position. The bench clarified that it had not expressed any opinion on the merits of the writ petitions pending before the High Court and that the concerned respondents-accused could take all legal contentions or take recourse to legal remedies as may be available to them in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the share of property among heirs. Govindammal and her husband owned a property, and after her husband's death, she was given 2/3rd share in it. The case went through various court proceedings, including a lower appellate court and the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the High Court had jurisdiction to overturn the concurrent findings of the lower courts, but this was disputed by the respondents. The arguments centered around the principles regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that an erroneous finding of fact is different from an error or defect in procedure and that there is no jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the ground of an erroneous finding of fact. The principles regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 were summarized by the court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court. It was held that Govindammal (now her heirs) is entitled to 2/3rd share in the property. The findings of the lower courts were restored, and any pending applications were disposed of accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal appeal against the appellants, Geddam Jhansi and Geddam Sathyakama Jabali. The proceedings are pending in two separate cases, "C.C. No. 46 of 2022" and DVC No. 25 of 2021, under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The appellants are mother-in-law's sisters of the complainant.
The marriage took place in Pondicherry, but the couple lives with the principal accused (mother-in-law) in Chennai. The appellants reside in Hyderabad and do not live together with the complainant and her husband.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
There are no explicit arguments mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the defense argued that there is no prima facie case against the appellants to continue the criminal proceedings against them. They also pointed out that the allegations against the appellants were general and did not disclose any specific details.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the evidence presented in the case does not constitute a prima facie case against the appellants. The sweeping allegations made by the complainant without specific details were considered insufficient to continue the criminal proceedings against the appellants.
It was also noted that the appellants do not live together with the principal accused, making it difficult for them to be held responsible for alleged offenses committed in the matrimonial house of the complainant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed both the present Criminal Appeals. The impugned judgments and orders passed by the Ld. Single Bench of the High Court for the State of Telangana were set aside, and the criminal proceedings against the appellants were quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
The court also exercised its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to quash the criminal proceeding against the appellant Geddam Jhansi in DVC No. 25 of 2021.
It was clarified that the observations and findings recorded by the court would not have any bearing on the criminal proceedings against other accused persons, and the trial courts were expected to proceed with the criminal proceedings pending against them after proper appreciation of evidence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the refund of duty drawback to a respondent by the appellants. The respondent had made applications for refund in 1996, and the decision to grant refund was taken belatedly on 07.10.2002. Payments were made by way of cheques on 31.03.2003 and 20.05.2003.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants contended that there was no provision for payment of interest on delayed refund of duty drawback. They also argued that the refund of duty drawback was granted as a concession, not to be treated as a precedent.
On the other hand, the respondent claimed entitlement to refund of duty drawback as a deemed export under the Duty Drawback Scheme and sought interest at the rate fixed by the Central Government.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had awarded interest at the rate of fifteen percent per annum without referring to the notification fixing the rate of interest at fifteen percent. The court also did not discuss why the rate of interest on the delayed refund should be fifteen percent.
The Central Board of Excise and Customs had fixed the rate of interest at fifteen percent for the purpose of Section 27A of the Customs Act through a notification bearing No.32/1995 (NT) – Customs dated 26.5.1995.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the respondent was entitled to refund of duty drawback. The appellants had belatedly accepted the claim and made the refund, and therefore, the respondent was entitled to interest at the rate fixed by the Central Government at the relevant point of time being fifteen percent.
The court found no good reason to interfere with the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 22.8.2008. The appeal was accordingly dismissed without costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants failed to appear before the Trial Court after receiving summons. Despite issuance of bailable and non-bailable warrants, they did not comply with the orders of the Court. The appellants also withdrew their "bail-cum-surrender application" fearing arrest. After coming to know about the proclamation under Section 82 Cr.PC., they did not take any steps to challenge it or enter appearance before the Trial Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The power to grant anticipatory bail is an extraordinary one, and its grant should be left to the cautious and judicious discretion of the Court. The Court has to be very cautious while exercising this power as the grant of interim protection in serious cases may lead to miscarriage of justice and hamper investigation. When warrant of arrest or proclamation is issued, the applicant is not entitled to invoke the extraordinary power. 
The pendency of an application for anticipatory bail shall not bar the Trial Court in issuing/proceeding with steps for proclamation and taking steps under Section 83 Cr.PC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The consistent disobedience of the appellants to comply with the orders of the trial Court has been observed. Their conduct has left no hesitation to hold that they are not entitled to seek the benefit of pre-arrest bail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The upshot of the discussion is that there is no ground for interfering with the order of the High Court rejecting the application for anticipatory bail rather not considering application on merits. The appeal must fail as their action is nothing short of defying the lawful orders of the Court and attempting to delay the proceedings. Consequently, it is dismissed.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over agricultural Watan lands in Maharashtra, India. The original Watandar (owner) died in February/March 1958, and the legal heirs attempted to take possession of the land from the tenants. However, the Tenancy Act was applicable to the subject lands by then, specifically Sections 29 and 31 thereof. The tenants exercised their right of statutory purchase under Section 32 of the Tenancy Act after the exemption afforded by Section 88CA ceased to exist.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (legal heirs of the original Watandar) argued that they could proceed against the tenants under the provisions of Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act. However, the respondents (tenants) contended that the tenancy was lawfully subsisting on 01.04.1957 (Tillers' Day), and they were entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase under Section 32 of the Tenancy Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the subject lands became part of the extended city limits of Pimpari Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and are presently reserved for Defence purposes (Red Zone) in the development plans sanctioned by the Government of Maharashtra. However, this information is not relevant to the present case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that it was not open to the appellants to proceed against the tenants under the provisions of Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act after the death of Balaji Chimnaji More, the original Watandar. This is because the provisions of the Tenancy Act were very much applicable to the subject lands by then and more so, Sections 29 and 31 thereof. Therefore, the legal heirs of the original Watandar could not have taken lawful possession of these lands from the tenants pursuant to the order dated 18.04.1961 passed under Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act. The tenancy was lawfully subsisting on 01.04.1957 (Tillers' Day), and the tenants were entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase of these tenanted agricultural Watan lands under Section 32 of the Tenancy Act in terms of Section 8 of the Abolition Act, after the exemption afforded by Section 88CA ceased to exist.

<FACTS>
The case involves a group of appellants who were initially classified as temporary employees of the SSD Fund. They had been serving for decades in a manner indistinguishable from regular government employees. The appellants argued that their employment conditions, as evolved over time, warranted reclassification from temporary to regular status.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' arguments were based on the principle that "the essence of employment and the rights thereof cannot be merely determined by the initial terms of appointment when the actual course of employment has evolved significantly over time." They cited administrative orders and Board proceedings that consistently treated them as equivalent to regular government employees. The appellants also argued that their temporary classification was an oversimplification of their employment relationship with the government.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the denial of pensionary benefits solely on the basis of the appellants' temporary status appeared to be arbitrary and violated their fundamental rights as guaranteed by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The court also noted that the financial health of the SSD Fund would not be adversely affected by extending benefits to the appellants.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and directed the respondents to extend the benefits of the 6th Central Pay Commission, including pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008, to the appellants in the same terms as are being afforded to their peers in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, a 38-year-old man from a poor nomadic community in Maharashtra, was convicted of committing a gruesome crime. He had an alcoholic father and suffered parental neglect and poverty. The appellant dropped out of school at the age of 10 and worked odd jobs to support his family. Despite efforts to bring his family out of poverty, he failed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellant's actions were a grave and unpardonable crime, warranting the death penalty. The defense, however, presented mitigating circumstances such as the appellant's poor upbringing, lack of education, and absence of any prior criminal record.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the doctrine of "rarest of rare" requires consideration not only of the gravity of the crime but also the possibility of reformation. The court observed that the appellant's behavior in prison has been satisfactory for six years, and he suffers from serious ailments, including speech issues.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was partly allowed. The order of conviction was affirmed, but the sentence of death penalty was converted to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment without remission. The appellant would not be entitled to apply for remission during this period.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The complainant and the appellant had a long-term consensual relationship for about nine years. The complainant alleged that the appellant promised to marry her but later resiled from his promise. The FIR was registered against the appellant under Sections 376, 420, 504, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court include:
* There is no prima facie case made out about commission of an offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC.
* No allegations of cheating have been made against the appellant to fall within the scope of Section 420 IPC, nor of any of the offences under Sections 504 and 506 of the IPC.
* Allowing the criminal proceeding against the appellant in the facts and circumstances to continue would amount to an abuse of the process of court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* There is a worrying trend that consensual relationships going on for prolonged periods, upon turning sour, have been sought to be criminalised by invoking criminal jurisprudence.
* Human relationships and psychology are dynamic and permeated with an array of unpredictable human emotions and sensitivities.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:
* The appeal is allowed and the impugned judgement and order dated 12.02.2018 passed by the Bombay High Court in Criminal Writ Petition (CRWP) No. 5190 of 2017 is set aside.
* The FIR being CR No. 302 of 2017 dated 15.08.2017 registered against the appellant with the Kharghar Police Station, Navi Mumbai under Sections 376, 420, 504, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code is quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around an appeal against the grant of sanction under Section 45 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The appellant is accused of committing a certain offense and claims to be exempt from prosecution under Section 22A of the Companies Act, 2013. The validity of the sanction granted by the authorities has been challenged by the appellant. The Trial Court had allowed the appeal, and the State had filed an application before the High Court seeking to set aside this order.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The validity of the sanction should be challenged at the earliest instance available, before the Trial Court. If such a challenge is raised at an appellate stage, it would be for the person raising the challenge to justify the reasons for bringing the same at a belated stage.
- The timelines mentioned in Rules 3 & 4 of the 2008 Rules are couched in mandatory language and therefore have to be strictly followed. This is keeping in view that UAPA being a penal legislation, strict construction must be accorded to it.
- Timelines imposed by way of statutory rules are a way to keep a check on executive power which is a necessary position to protect the rights of accused persons.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
Some key observations from the case include:
- The identity of the appellant has been stolen, and he is an uneducated person who claims to be a munshi. This makes it difficult for the Court to decide at this stage whether Section 22A applies to the appellant or not.
- This is once again a matter for evidence.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Judgment of the case states:
- The appeal lacks merit and, accordingly, is dismissed.
- Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants, a group of employees, were initially classified as temporary employees. However, despite their formal classification, they had been treated as equivalent to regular government employees by the administrative orders and Board proceedings. The appellants sought pensionary benefits, which were denied to them solely on the basis of their temporary status.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that their employment bore substantial hallmarks of regular government service, despite being formally classified as temporary employees. They relied on the principle that "the essence of employment and the rights thereof cannot be merely determined by the initial terms of appointment when the actual course of employment has evolved significantly over time." (Vinod Kumar case)
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the mere classification of employees as 'temporary' or 'permanent' carries significant legal implications, particularly in terms of service benefits and protections. The denial of pensionary benefits solely on the basis of their temporary status was considered arbitrary and violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the appellants' employment conditions, as evolved over time, warranted a reclassification from temporary to regular status. The respondents were directed to extend the benefits of the 6th Central Pay Commission, including pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008, to the appellants in the same terms as are being afforded to their peers in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a civil suit where the Trial Court admitted an instrument in evidence without applying judicial mind, and later exercised its inherent power to do justice and prevent abuse of process. The issue was whether the Trial Court's order dated 19th October, 2010 was valid or not.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the Trial Court's order admitting the instrument in evidence without applying judicial mind was invalid. The respondent countered by arguing that the Trial Court had exercised its inherent power to do justice and prevent abuse of process, making the order valid.

However, upon re-examination, the High Court held that the Trial Court's failure to apply judicial mind and admit the instrument in evidence was indeed a technical error. The respondent cited section 58 of the 1957 Act to argue that since no determination was made regarding the instrument being duly stamped or not requiring a stamp, its applicability was not attracted.

The appellant argued that the revenue would suffer huge losses if courts fail to discharge their duty per provisions like section 33 of the 1957 Act. The respondent relied on section 58 of the 1957 Act and stated that it does not apply in this situation because no order was passed admitting the instrument as duly stamped or one requiring a stamp.

The appellant contended that the Trial Court's exercise of inherent power to do justice and prevent abuse of process was valid, and its order dated 19th October, 2010 should be upheld.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Trial Court admitted an instrument in evidence without applying judicial mind, leading to the issue at hand. The High Court had set aside the Trial Court's order, but upon re-examination, the Supreme Court restored it.

The Trial Court exercised its inherent power to do justice and prevent abuse of process. This was a valid exercise, as there was an admitted failure on the part of the court to apply judicial mind. The Trial Court also appreciated this approach in its judicious exercise of inherent power.

The revenue would suffer huge losses if courts fail to discharge their duty per provisions like section 33 of the 1957 Act. It is imperative that compliance with all substantive and procedural requirements are adhered to by interested parties.

This case sets a precedent for upholding the sanctity of the legal framework governing stamp duty, ensuring due compliance and strict adherence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned order of the High Court dated 26th September, 2011, and restored the Trial Court's order dated 19th October, 2010.

The court held that for all purposes and intents, the Trial Court passed the order in exercise of its inherent power saved by section 151, CPC, to do justice as well as to prevent abuse of process. This was a valid exercise due to the admitted failure on the part of the court to apply judicial mind as required.

The revenue would stand the risk of suffering huge loss if courts fail to discharge their duty placed on them per provisions like section 33 of the 1957 Act. The Supreme Court underscored the importance of upholding the sanctity of the legal framework governing stamp duty, ensuring due compliance and strict adherence.

<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal appeal by Hussainbhai Asgarali Lokhandwala. The incident occurred due to a matrimonial dispute between his sister and brother-in-law Abbasbhai. On the day of the incident, there was tension building up since morning as Abbasbhai was insisting that his wife Oneja should come to his house and then on the cupboard key of the Ahmedabad house to be handed over to him. The incident took place inside the residence of Asgarali (and then spilling over onto the street in front) and not in the residence of Idrishbhai. Hussainbhai, a young man of 18 years of age at the time of the incident, was overcome by emotion which led him to physically attack the deceased and his son (brother-in-law). The fact that the incident was not premeditated is buttressed by the happening thereof inside the residence of Asgarali. There were only stab wounds each on the stomach of the deceased and PW-5.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in this case are:
1. Alteration of conviction: The High Court had altered the conviction of both Asgarali and Hussainbhai from one under Section 304 Part I IPC to one under Section 304 Part II IPC.
2. Modification of sentence: The High Court modified the sentence of Asgarali to the period of incarceration already undergone by him, while that of Hussainbhai was modified to five years.
3. Emotional state of Hussainbhai: It is argued that Hussainbhai was overcome by emotion which led him to physically attack the deceased and his son (brother-in-law).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case are:
1. The incident had occurred in the heat of the moment.
2. Neither party could control their anger, which ultimately resulted into the fateful incident.
3. Hussainbhai was a young man of 18 years of age at the time of the incident studying in Class 12.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed in this case is:
1. Criminal Appeal No. 1691 of 2023 is partly allowed.
2. While maintaining the conviction of the appellant Hussainbhai Asgarali Lokhandwala under Section 304 Part II IPC, his sentence is modified to the period already undergone by him.
3. All the other criminal appeals are dismissed.
4. The appellant Hussainbhai Asgarali Lokhandwala is directed to be released forthwith, if his detention is not required in any other case.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a person who was accused of abetting the suicide of another individual. The prosecution's case is entirely based on a suicide note left behind by the deceased before committing suicide. The appellant, who was charged under Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act, claimed that the charges were baseless and an abuse of process.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:
- The prosecution's case relies entirely on a suicide note, which does not indicate any act or omission on the part of the accused appellant to make him responsible for abetment.
- The contents of the suicide note show that the deceased was frustrated due to work pressure and apprehensive about various random factors unconnected to his official duties.
- The investigating agency initially proposed a closure report in the matter after conducting a thorough investigation, which suggests that there is no justifiable ground to permit the prosecution of the appellant for the offences under Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
- The High Court was not justified in rejecting the petition filed by the appellants under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the charges under Section 306 IPC against them.
- The High Court should have quashed the proceedings so that the appellants who were not remotely connected with the offence under Section 306 IPC would not have been compelled to face the rigmaroles of a criminal trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case is as follows:
- The charges under Section 306 IPC against the appellants are quashed.
- The impugned order passed by the High Court and all proceedings sought to be taken against the appellant in the criminal case pending for the offences punishable under Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act are hereby quashed and set aside.

The case involves allegations of witchcraft and discrimination against women. The court has been presented with various legislations, judicial pronouncements, and literature related to the protection of women from discrimination and exploitation.

The court notes that there are reports of older women being subjected to imprisonment, forced starvation, damaging "exorcism" ceremonies, and being abandoned by their families and community members. Women accused of witchcraft are also reportedly exiled to the margins of their communities and forced to live in deplorable conditions.

The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has emphasized the need for States to combat all forms of discrimination and violence against older women accused of witchcraft, including intimidation, isolation, abuse, and killings. The committee has also stressed the importance of investigating incidents of violence against women based on accusations of witchcraft, preventing their reoccurrence, prosecuting perpetrators, strengthening legislation enforcement, and criminalizing accusations of witchcraft.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court has observed that the judgment impugned before it has been rendered null by subsequent withdrawal. However, given the peculiarity of the situation and the vulgarity of the actions alleged, the court has adopted a course to proceed with the trial against the accused persons.

The court notes that public education programs are necessary to highlight the negative impact of accusations of witchcraft on both men and women, as well as community leaders and religious leaders. The court also observes that special programs should be implemented to address the psychological trauma, physical harm, social exclusion, and impoverishment of women accused of witchcraft.

The court has emphasized the need for States to take immediate and effective measures to investigate incidents of violence against and murder of women and girls based on accusations of witchcraft. The committee has also noted that perpetrators should be prosecuted and adequately punished.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
(1) The matter is placed on the file of the concerned District Court to proceed in accordance with the law.

(2) The Trial against the accused persons shall proceed on a day-to-day basis.

(3) The accused persons are directed to appear before the Trial Court on 15th January 2025.

(4) It stands clarified that comments made hereinabove reflect only the heinousness of the crimes committed and do not in any way cast a shadow of guilt over the accused persons.

(5) The Trial shall proceed keeping in view the aforesaid principles but uninfluenced by any observations made in this judgment.

Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.

The case involves Mahadeo, who was terminated from his service by the Corporation. He claimed 100% back wages for the period of termination till superannuation. The Corporation argued that Mahadeo worked on a daily wage basis during badli work and earned some wages.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The employee (Mahadeo) argued that he was entitled to 100% back wages from the date of his termination till the date of his superannuation. He claimed that due to the Corporation's illegal act, he was deprived of his job and had no opportunity to work elsewhere.
The employer (Corporation) argued that Mahadeo earned some wages during badli work on a daily wage basis and therefore should not be entitled to full back wages.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Corporation's action was illegal and bad in law. It also noted that Mahadeo was willing to perform work but was not accepted by the employer. The court further stated that while grant of full back wages is the normal rule, an exceptional case with sufficient proof has to be set up by the employer to escape the burden of bearing back wages.
The court also observed that the Corporation had succeeded in getting rid of Mahadeo through suppressio veri and suggestio falsi (suppressing truth and suggesting falsehood).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court modified the order awarding 100% back wages to Mahadeo. Instead, it awarded him 75% of the back wages from the date of his termination till the date of his superannuation.
Mahadeo was also entitled to full terminal benefits along with interest @ 6% per annum, had he never been dismissed from service.
The amounts were to be released in Mahadeo's favour by the Corporation within three months from the date of its communication. In default, the said amount shall carry further interest @ 2% from such default till full payment.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a notification issued by the government in 1994, which made 'ghee' a product that could be regulated under provisions of the Market Fee Act. The notification had an effect from July 5, 1994. The appellants were not required to pay market fee during the pendency of the matter before the High Court due to interim protection granted by the court. After the majority decision of the High Court in Kommissetty Nammalwar (Supra), market committees started issuing demand notices to the producers of 'Ghee' asking them to pay fees from the date of the notification in 1994 to the date of the High Court judgment i.e., May 1, 2009. The appellants prayed that they should be exempted from paying the fee to the market committees prior to the High Court judgment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the process under Section 3 of the Act had not been followed for working the scheme under Section 4 of the Act, and therefore, the 1994 notification was invalid. They also prayed that they should be exempted from paying market fees prior to the High Court judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that no prior process was required to be followed as contemplated under Section 3 of the Act for working the scheme under Section 4 of the Act. The 1994 notification was a notification under Section 4 and not of Section 3 of the Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that there was nothing wrong in the 1994 notification, and the challenge to the notification had rightly been turned down by the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The appellants were liable to pay market fees for the period prior to the High Court judgment. However, considering the long duration of time (over 14 years) that the fee had accumulated, the court permitted the appellants to deposit the fee with the committee within two years in four equal instalments.

<FACTS>
The case involves land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The landowners' appeals are against the grant of compensation at INR 340 per sq. yd., while NOIDA authorities have filed appeals against the higher compensation granted by the High Court at INR 449 per sq. yd.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court considers the enhanced compensation as a benchmark for all affected parties covered by the same notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act, allowing them to seek parity with such enhancement under Section 28A of the 1894 Act.
The landowners argue that they should receive the same rate of compensation as granted to the other landowners in the same area.
NOIDA authorities contest the higher compensation granted by the High Court and request that it be reduced to INR 340 per sq. yd.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that Section 28A aims to rectify disparities between landowners, allowing all affected parties covered by the same notification to seek redetermination of compensation once the court grants higher compensation under Section 18.
The provision seeks to remedy inequalities in compensation for similar quality of land.
The issue of uniformity in awarding compensation is rendered academic as such a relief already stands granted to all the landowners, though on different grounds.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the landowners' appeals in part and enhances the rate of compensation from INR 340 per sq. yd. to INR 403 per sq. yd.
The appeals by NOIDA authorities against the grant of higher compensation are also allowed in part, reducing the rate of compensation granted by the High Court from INR 449 per sq. yd. to INR 403 per sq. yd.
The enhanced compensation amount is to be deposited with the Reference Court within a period of eight weeks and then disbursed to the claimants at the earliest.
All matters stand disposed of in the aforementioned terms and directions.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an acquittal of the appellant from charges levelled against him. The facts are related to a murder case, with the prosecution presenting evidence to prove the guilt of the accused.
The key facts mentioned in the case include:
* Evidence presented by the prosecution is inconsistent and lacks coherence.
* Inconsistencies in the chain of circumstances have not been explained by the prosecution.
* Extra-judicial confession of one witness (PW-1) is doubtful.
* Unnatural conduct of PW-1 raises doubts about his testimony.
* Recovery of the dead body was done in the presence of an unreliable witness (PW-2).
* Contradictions regarding arrest and prior/successive conduct of witnesses are mentioned.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that minor inconsistencies do not amount to reasonable doubt, citing cases such as Sucha Singh v. State of Punjab, Mallikarjun, and Hari Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh.
However, the Supreme Court countered this argument by stating that while it is true that minor inconsistencies are not always a ground for acquittal, in this case, the prosecution's evidence fails to establish a coherent chain of circumstances.
The Supreme Court emphasized that the duty of a judge is not only to ensure an innocent person is not punished but also to ensure that the guilty do not escape punishment. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the investigating agency and prosecution to provide strong evidence for conviction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Supreme Court include:
* The inconsistencies in the case of the prosecution are significant and cannot be dismissed as minor.
* The prosecution's failure to explain the inconsistencies raises serious doubts about their case.
* The case does not fall into the category of a light-hearted acquittal, which is shunned upon in law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the appellant, stating that the evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to prove guilt. The court concluded that the inconsistencies in the chain of circumstances are too significant to ignore and that the prosecution's case fails to establish a coherent narrative.
As such, the High Court's decision to reverse the order of acquittal was set aside, and the original order of acquittal was restored. The appellant was acquitted from all charges levelled against him and directed to be released forthwith if lying in custody.

The case involves a petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. in a criminal trial. The respondent no. 1 had earlier filed an application for further investigation, which was rejected by the court. However, the same grounds were rehashed in a new application filed in January 2020.
The case has been pending for eleven years after the incident, and the trial has still not concluded.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's arguments are not explicitly mentioned in the given text.
However, it can be inferred that the respondent no. 1 had argued that there was a need for further investigation to ensure justice is served.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that all stakeholders have contributed to the delay in the trial, which has been pending for eleven years.
The court also noted that the administration of justice feeds on the faith and confidence of the citizenry, and nothing should be done to shake that faith and confidence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 30.04.2021 in Criminal RC (MD) No. 533 of 2020.
Consequently, Cr. M.P. No 40/2020 in S.C. No. 61/2014 filed by the respondent no. 1 before the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. was dismissed.
The court also directed that the additional charge sheet dated 02.12.2021 will not be taken on record.

The Madarsa Act was enacted by the State legislature to regulate the standard of education in Madrasas recognized by the Board for imparting Madarsa education. The High Court had ruled that the entire Madarsa Act suffered from infirmities, but the Supreme Court disagreed with this ruling.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the State argued that the Madarsa Act was within its legislative competence and consistent with the positive obligation of the State to ensure that students studying in recognized Madrasas attain a level of competency.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the purpose behind the Madarsa Act was to remove difficulties in running the Madrasas, improve their merit, and provide adequate facilities to students. The court noted that the legislature would have enacted the statute even if it were aware that the portions pertaining to higher education (Fazil and Kamil) were invalid.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ruled that only the provisions which pertain to Fazil and Kamil are unconstitutional, as they are in conflict with the UGC Act. The court set aside the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 22 March 2024 and disposed of the petitions accordingly.

The appellant had obtained a decree for Rs. 2,50,000 with interest at 36% p.a. from 24.06.2000. The Single Judge modified the decree to reduce the rate of interest to 12% p.a. However, the Division Bench restored the original decision of the Single Judge. The appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant's primary contention was against the restoration of the original decision by the Division Bench.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations and comments made during the course of the judgment are limited to the following:
* The Court noted that there was a delay of 589 days in filing the petition against the First Impugned Order and approximately 84 days in filing the petition against the Second Impugned Order.
* The Court condoned the delay and allowed I.A. No.16203/2019, subject to payment of costs of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) by the appellant to the respondent.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Supreme Court is as follows:
* The appeals were allowed in terms that the interest at the rate of 36% p.a. was on the excessive side and was pared down to 12% p.a. in the interest of justice.
* Simple interest would run only @ 12% p.a. from 24.06.2000 till the date of realisation.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute regarding the payment of stamp duty on an agreement to lease under the Build, Operate and Transfer (B.O.T.) scheme. The appellants had entered into an agreement with MPRSNN, respondent no.3, where they were given the right to collect tolls in lieu of the amount spent by the lessee in construction of roads, bridge etc. The amount spent by the lessee was approximately 50% of the total cost of the project.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The appellants argued that they had paid a stamp duty of 2% on the amount likely to be spent under the agreement, which is around Rs.24.10 crores.
- The respondents argued that the stamp duty was payable on the entire project cost, not just the amount spent by the lessee.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- The court observed that the view taken by the High Court was further fortified by two judgments, which considered any instrument by which tolls of any description are let as a "lease" for the purpose of payment of stamp duty under the Stamp Act.
- The court noted that the amount spent by the lessee was not exactly 50% but slightly different figures were mentioned in the agreement.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:
- The demand raised on the whole amount would be unjustified, and to this extent, the demand needs to be set aside.
- The Collector (Stamps)/Revenue Officer of the concerned district is directed to re-calculate the stamp duty payable on the amount spent by the lessee.
- If the appellants have deposited the demand raised on the entire project cost, then the amount lying in excess with the State would be refunded to them.
- In case of any deficit in stamp duty having not been deposited, the appellants would deposit the same within two months of the fresh demand being raised by the Revenue Officer/Collector (Stamps) of the district concerned.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the inheritance of a tenancy by Smt. Usha Mitra and the appellants from Sh. S.K. Mitra, who died in 1970. The issue is whether the 1997 Act has a retrospective operation and affects the heritable rights of the tenants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argue that there is no clear and unequivocal intention in the 1997 Act to have a retrospective operation. They contend that statutory laws operate prospectively, unless the legislature intends otherwise, which must be shown clearly and unambiguously in the statute itself.

On the other hand, the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court interprets the statutory provision to mean that the 1997 Act changes "heritable rights" retrospectively. They argue that since the legislature can restrict heritability by amending or repealing the law, it has done precisely that in the 1997 Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:

* The court notes that the legislature can restrict heritability by amending or repealing the law. However, this does not necessarily mean that the 1997 Act has a retrospective operation.
* The court observes that statutory laws operate prospectively, unless the legislature intends otherwise, which must be shown clearly and unambiguously in the statute itself.
* The court also references another case (Smt. Usha Mitra vs. S.K. Mitra) where it was held that the exclusion of a spouse from inheriting tenancy rights is without rationale, discriminatory, and deprives the surviving spouse of a valuable entitlement granted to other heirs.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately holds in favor of the appellants, stating that their tenancy did not expire in 2006 due to the introduction of the 1997 Act. The court reasons that there is no clear and unequivocal intention in the 1997 Act to have a retrospective operation.

The orders dated June 29, 2022, and December 8, 2022, of the Single Judge and the Division Bench respectively are set aside. The pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of, and the interim order(s), if any, stand vacated.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute regarding the admission of a candidate to an educational institution. The candidate has benchmark disability and was denied admission based on their quantified disability. The candidate's appeal is pending in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, which has been stayed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the applicant is arguing against the denial of admission based on their quantified disability and seeking a reconsideration of their application.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The court notes that quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission to educational institutions.
- The court emphasizes the importance of considering the potential of individuals with disabilities and providing them with opportunities to pursue their education.
- The court mentions the examples of several Indian individuals who have achieved great success despite their disabilities, including Sudha Chandran, Arunima Sinha, and Srikanth Bolla.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:
(i) We hold that quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission to educational institutions. The candidate will be eligible, if the Disability Assessment Board opines that notwithstanding the quantified disability the candidate can pursue the course in question.
(ii) The Disability Assessment Boards assessing the candidates should positively record whether the disability of the candidate will or will not come in the way of the candidate pursuing the course in question. The Disability Assessment Boards should state reasons in the event of the Disability Assessment Boards concluding that the candidate is not eligible for pursuing the course.
(iii) The Disability Assessment Boards will, pending formulation of appropriate regulations by the NMC, pursuant to the communication of 25.01.2024 by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, keep in mind the salutary points mentioned in the said communication while forming their opinion.
(iv) Pending creation of the appellate body, we further direct that such decisions of the Disability Assessment Boards which give a negative opinion for the candidate will be amenable to challenge in judicial review proceedings. The Court seized of the matter in the judicial review proceedings shall refer the case of the candidate to any premier medical institute having the facility, for an independent opinion and relief to the candidate will be granted or denied based on the opinion of the said medical institution to which the High Court had referred the matter.
(v) We have already, pursuant to our order dated 18.09.2024, in view of the favorable report dated 13.09.2024 of the Maulana Azad Medical College, granted admission to the appellant. We confirm the admission and direct the concerned authorities to treat the admission as a valid admission in the eye of law.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a criminal investigation where evidence was allegedly forged, leading to an acquittal in the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) case. Afterward, an FIR (First Information Report) was registered. The High Court intervened and quashed the criminal proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the forgery of evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice, and the trial should continue to ensure truth and fairness.
The defense argued that the High Court's intervention was justified due to the irregularities in the investigation process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The alleged forgery has significant implications for the integrity of the investigation and the administration of justice. The High Court's decision to quash the proceedings was likely motivated by concerns about the reliability of the evidence and the potential impact on the accused.
The case highlights the importance of ensuring that investigations are conducted fairly and without irregularities, as well as the need for courts to be vigilant in protecting the rights of all parties involved.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order quashing the criminal proceedings and restored the original order taking cognizance. The trial court was directed to conclude the trial within one year from the date of the judgment, with the accused required to appear before the court on a specified date.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The accused appellant was convicted and sentenced for a crime, but the conviction was later challenged in an appeal. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence to link the accused to the crime scene.
The Investigating Officer (PW-22) testified that the accused allegedly suffered a disclosure under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, which led to the recovery of incriminating articles from the crime scene. However, the testimony of the Investigating Officer and other witnesses revealed inconsistencies in their statements.
The prosecution also relied on DNA profiling report to link the recovered skeletal remains with the blood of the mother of the deceased (PW-1). However, there were discrepancies in the testimony of PW-1 and Dr. Syed Irshad, Medical Officer (PW-15) regarding the collection of blood samples.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the circumstantial evidence established a link between the accused and the crime scene. The recovery of incriminating articles from the house of the accused was cited as evidence to support this claim.
However, the defense argued that the prosecution had failed to establish a clear chain of events leading to the discovery of the crime scene. The defense pointed out inconsistencies in the testimony of the Investigating Officer and other witnesses.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence, which must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, upon examination of the evidence presented by the prosecution, the court found several discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimony of key witnesses.
The court noted that the DNA profiling report was crucial to linking the recovered skeletal remains with the accused, but since there were discrepancies in the testimony regarding the collection of blood samples, this link could not be established conclusively.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court held that none of the incriminating circumstances portrayed by the prosecution had been established by cogent and clinching evidence. Therefore, the conviction of the accused appellant was set aside, and he was acquitted of the charges.
The court further directed that the accused be released forthwith if not wanted in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>

- The High Court upheld the conviction and sentenced the accused to imprisonment.
- The accused appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging his conviction and sentence.
- The Supreme Court heard the appeal and delivered its judgment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties in the case are as follows:
- The prosecution argued that the accused had intentionally killed the deceased with a firearm, and therefore, was guilty of murder.
- The defense argued that the accused had acted under grave and sudden provocation, which reduced his culpability to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
- The Supreme Court examined the evidence and the arguments presented by both parties and applied the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to arrive at its judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court in the case are as follows:
- The court noted that the accused had used a firearm to kill the deceased, which was not a weapon commonly used for self-defense.
- The court observed that the number of gunshots fired at the deceased and the location of the wounds suggested premeditation rather than a reaction to sudden provocation.
- The court also noted that the accused had regained his composure after firing the shots, which further suggested premeditation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in the case is as follows:
- The court dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence of the accused.
- The court held that the accused was guilty of murder and not culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
- The court observed that the accused had intentionally killed the deceased with a firearm, which was a clear case of murder.

The case involves a dispute over the payment of property tax by the respondent on an enemy property vested in the Custodian for Enemy Property in India. The High Court had previously held in favor of the respondent, but the Supreme Court is reversing this order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented include:

*   The Custodian for Enemy Property in India does not acquire ownership of enemy properties and only holds them as a trustee for management and administration.
*   The Central Government may initiate divestment of enemy property to the owner or another person, and vesting of enemy property in the Custodian is only temporary.
*   Since there is no transfer of ownership from the owner to the Custodian, the Union of India does not assume ownership of enemy properties.
*   Clause (1) of Article 285 does not apply to enemy properties since they are not Union properties, and clause (2) would only apply if the enemy properties were Union properties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made include:

*   The Supreme Court notes that any demand for payment of taxes made by the respondent under the 1959 Act shall not be refunded.
*   If no demand notices have been issued till date, they shall not be issued, but from the current fiscal year onwards (2024-2025), the appellant will be entitled to levy and collect property tax as well as water tax and sewerage charges and any other local taxes in accordance with law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order of the High Court dated 29.03.2017, passed in Misc. Bench No.2317 of 2012.

Key points from the judgment:

*   The Custodian for Enemy Property does not acquire ownership of enemy properties.
*   The Central Government may initiate divestment of enemy property to the owner or another person.
*   Clause (1) of Article 285 does not apply to enemy properties since they are not Union properties.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of various sections and entries in the Industrial Development and Regulation Act (IDRA). The focus is on Section 18G and its applicability to denatured alcohol.
Item 26 of the First Schedule to the IDRA must be read as excluding the industry "intoxicating liquor".
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented include:
- The interpretation of the word 'industry' in Legislative entries does not fall for determination in this reference.
- Denatured alcohol covers is covered by Entry 8 of List II and therefore, Section 18G occupies the field under Entry 33(a) – List III.
- The misuse of alcohol cannot be a guide while interpreting the content of Entry 8 and its scope and ambit being amplified beyond what it really envisages as a field of legislation for the States to legislate upon.
- The judgment in Synthetics (7J) is overruled in terms of this judgment, except for Section 18G of the IDRA.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made include:
- The judgment in Tika Ramji (supra) is held to be not good law insofar as the interpretation of word 'industry' as it occurs in the Legislative entries does not fall for determination in this reference.
- The issue of whether Section 18G of the IDRA covers the field under Entry 33(a) of List III does not arise for adjudication in view of the finding that denatured alcohol is covered by Entry 8 of List II.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
- The correct interpretation of Entry 8 – List II is that it covers denatured alcohol and not the final product containing alcohol.
- Item 26 of the First Schedule to the IDRA must be read excluding only what is contained in the expression "intoxicating liquors" as interpreted above in Entry 8 – List II.
- The judgment in Synthetics (7J) is overruled in terms of this judgment, except for Section 18G of the IDRA.
- The issue of whether Section 18G of the IDRA covers the field under Entry 33(a) of List III does not arise for adjudication in view of the finding that denatured alcohol is covered by Entry 8 of List II.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and its status as a minority institution under Article 30 of the Indian Constitution. The facts pertain to the establishment of AMU in 1910-1920, with an emphasis on its minority character.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case focus on the interpretation of Article 30 and its implications for minority institutions like AMU. Key points include:
* The importance of establishing the factum of establishment or not by the minority community
* The distinction between "minority only" ghettos and positive rights to minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice and kind
* The interplay, intermixing, and balancing of rights within fundamental rights, including Article 30
* The mandate to ensure parity between non-minority and minority institutions under Article 30(1)
* The assertion that the AMU 'Court' does not require members from the minority community ever since 1951
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations in the case include:
* The need to distinguish between constitutional rights and administrative actions or decisions
* The interplay of various provisions, including Article 30, within the Constitution's framework
* The role of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act and its implications for minority institutions
* The importance of not assuming that minorities require 'safe havens' for education and knowledge

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment in the case affirms the following points:
* Article 30 is not absolute and exists within a framework of interplay, intermixing, and balancing of rights with other fundamental rights.
* The crux of Article 30(1) lies in its mandate to ensure parity between non-minority and minority institutions.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 18G of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 (IDRA), and its relationship with Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.
The IDRA empowers Parliament to regulate industries specified in the First Schedule.
Entry 33(a) of List III grants Parliament exclusive power to make laws regarding scheduled industries.
The case involves the production and processing of potable alcohol, which is a scheduled industry under Entry 33(a).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments for the interpretation that Section 18G of the IDRA occupies the field:
- The expression "industrial alcohol" in Section 18G encompasses all types of industrial alcohol.
- Denatured alcohol is an essential ingredient in the production of potable alcohol, making it a part of the scheduled industry.
- Parliament's exclusive power under Entry 33(a) allows it to regulate all aspects of the scheduled industry, including denatured alcohol.

Arguments against this interpretation:
- The expression "industrial alcohol" does not explicitly include denatured alcohol.
- The IDRA's purpose is to regulate industries, not products or materials used in those industries.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judgment emphasizes the importance of interpreting legislative entries in light of their context and the Constitution as a whole.
It notes that the interpretation of "industry" in Legislative entries does not necessarily follow the meaning assigned to it in other contexts.
The judgment also highlights the need for caution when expanding the scope of Parliament's power under Entry 33(a).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
In my opinion, Tika Ramji (supra) is held to be not good law insofar as the interpretation of word "industry" as it occurs in the Legislative entries does not fall for determination in this reference; and has been mandated therein.
The correctness of the judgment in Tika Ramji (supra) on the interpretation of the word "industry" is not determinable in this reference.
Section 18G of the IDRA belongs to the family of "industrial alcohol" and therefore, Section 18G occupies the field under Entry 33(a) – List III and, thereby, only Parliament is competent to legislate on all articles or class of articles related to a scheduled industry i.e. "Fermentation Industries".

The case discusses the interpretation of Articles 38 and 39(b) and (c) of the Indian Constitution, which deal with the principles of social and economic justice. The arguments presented in the case include:
* The incorporation of these provisions in Part IV of the Constitution was based on the prevalent philosophy of the time and the path of development India chose to follow.
* The interpretation given to these provisions by the Court, particularly in Ranganatha Reddy and Sanjeev Coke, has its contextual relevance.
* Despite changes in situations, the inequality between the rich and the poor remains enormous, and it would not be prudent to abandon the principles on which Articles 38 and 39 are based.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court include:
* The broad and inclusive meaning given to the expression "material resources of the community" by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy in Ranganatha Reddy and Sanjeev Coke has stood the test of time.
* The inequality in income and wealth and the growing gap between the rich and the poor is still enormous, and it will not be prudent to abandon the principles on which Articles 38 and 39 are based.

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the Court states:
"The Krishna Iyer Doctrine, or for that matter the O. Chinnappa Reddy Doctrine, is familiar to all who have anything to do with law or life.

The case revolves around the interpretation of Entries 49 and 50 in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, which deal with taxation powers. The case involves the legality of royalties imposed by the State governments on minerals extracted from the land.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

*   The interpretation of Entries 49 and 50, particularly whether royalty is a tax within the meaning of these entries.
*   The scope of the taxation powers of the State legislatures under these entries.
*   The impact of the Mineral Concession Rules (MCR) on the State's power to impose royalties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations are made in the case:

*   Entry 50 is a unique entry where the taxing power of the State legislature has been subjected to "any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development."
*   The scope of expression "any limitations" in Entry 50 includes restrictions, conditions, principles, as well as prohibition.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in the case holds that:

*   Sections 9, 9A, and 25 of the MMDR Act, 1957 denude or limit the scope of Entry 50 - List II.
*   The majority decision in Kesoram is a serious departure from the law laid down by the seven-judge Bench in India Cement, which was wholly unwarranted. Therefore, the said majority judgment is liable to be overruled and is overruled to the extent that royalty is not a tax.
*   Taxes on lands and buildings under Entry 49 - List II contemplate a tax levied directly on the land as a unit having a defined relationship with the land and do not include mineral-bearing lands within its scope.
*   The State legislature is denuded of its powers under Entry 50 - List II to the extent of the provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957, due to the declaration under Section 2 of the said Act made in terms of Entry 54 - List I.

The case revolves around the constitutionality of sub-classification within Scheduled Castes for the purposes of reservation. The appellants, The State of Punjab & ORS., sought to exclude certain groups from the benefits of reservation under the Scheduled Castes category.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
- The validity of sub-classification within Scheduled Castes has been held to be constitutionally permissible by Hon'ble Dr. Justice D.Y.Chandrachud, Chief Justice of India and Hon'ble Mr. Justice B.R. Gavai.
- Empirical data must support any exercise involving sub-classification by the State, demonstrating the more 'disadvantaged' status of the sub-group to which preferential treatment is sought to be provided vis-a-vis the Constitutional Class as a whole.
- The identification of the 'creamy layer' qua Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has been held to be a constitutional imperative for the State by Justice Gavai, for the full realisation of substantive equality inter se the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
- The country has moved into a casteless society, except for the deeming provision under the Constitution for the limited purposes of affording reservation to the depressed class of persons, downtrodden or belonging to SC/ST/OBC.
- Any facility or privilege for the promotion of the above categories of persons must be on totally different criteria other than caste, such as economic or financial factors, status of living, vocation and facilities available based upon their place of living (urban or rural).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The reference is accordingly answered and it is held that sub-classification of scheduled castes is permissible in law for the purposes of reservation. It has also been emphasized that periodical exercise must be undertaken to exclude the class of persons who, after taking advantage of reservation, have come to march, shoulder to shoulder with the general category.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCTIONS>
The case involves appeals filed by the appellants against the orders passed by the High Court, which held that no offence was made out under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.
</FUNCTONS>

<FACTS>
The accused persons in both the appeals were not acquitted in their respective trials. The Trial Courts could not have discharged/deleted the charge under the NDPS Act framed against them while disposing of an application under Section 216 CrPC, as it was not permissible within the criminal procedure.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) must be given retrospective effect, and acquittals which have already been recorded as a consequence of the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) and have attained finality, would not be unsettled in light of the overruling decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Trial Courts committed an error in holding that the offence under the provisions of the NDPS Act is not made out. The High Court failed to take notice of this aspect.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Both the appeals filed by the appellants are allowed, and the impugned orders passed by the High Court are set aside.

<FILTERING OF EXCESS ENROLMENT FEE BY STATE BAR COUNCIL (SBC) CASE>

<FACTS>
The State Bar Council (SBC) was charging an excess enrolment fee from advocates, which violates Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. The SBC was charging fees other than the stipulated enrolment fee and stamp duty as a pre-condition to enrolment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the SBC's decision to charge excess enrolment fees violates their fundamental rights under Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. They also contended that the SBC cannot demand payment of fees other than the stipulated enrolment fee and stamp duty as a pre-condition to enrolment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the SBC's decision to charge excess enrolment fees is in violation of Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. The court noted that Section 24(1)(f) specifically lays down the fiscal pre-conditions subject to which an advocate can be enrolled on State rolls.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the SBC cannot charge "enrolment fees" beyond the express legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f). The court directed the SBC to ensure that the fees charged at the time of enrollment comply with Section 24(1)(f) and the provision is not defeated either directly or indirectly under the garb of different nomenclatures. The judgment will have prospective effect, and the SBC is not required to refund the excess enrolment fees collected before the date of this judgment.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the GEAC and MoEF&CC did not follow proper procedures while granting approval for environmental release of GM crops. They also raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of GM crops.
The respondents, Union of India & Others, defended their decision to grant conditional approval for environmental release of DMH-11, citing the benefits of GM crops in increasing crop yields and improving food security.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that judicial review of the decision taken by the bodies concerned in the matter of GMOs is permissible.
The court noted that the GEAC and MoEF&CC did not follow proper procedures while granting approval for environmental release of GM crops, which may have led to a conflict of interest among experts participating in the decision-making process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court issued the following directions:

i. The respondent-Union of India is directed to evolve a National Policy with regard to GM crops in the realm of research, cultivation, trade and commerce in the country.

ii. For the aforesaid purpose, the MoEF&CC shall conduct a national consultation, preferably within the next four months, with the aim of formulating the National Policy on GM crops.

iii. The respondent – Union of India must ensure that all credentials and past records of any expert who participates in the decision-making process should be scrupulously verified and conflict of interest, if any, should be declared and suitably mitigated by ensuring representation to wide range of interests.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>

* The arbitral tribunal relied on Section 18 of the 1963 Act to extend the limitation period based on an acknowledgement made in the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations were made by the court:
* The claimant's claim for the outstanding principal amount matured on 19 March 2016, and the limitation started to run from that date.
* Even if we count limitation from 21 September 2015 (as found by the Tribunal) it will have no material bearing on the award.
* The limitation for the claim as well as counterclaims other than those relating to cost of repair/replacement of gear boxes and fan modules stood extended under Section 18 of the Act based on acknowledgement made in the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>

*   Counseling can be an essential part of rehabilitation for those found guilty of such offenses.
*   Awareness about the realities of child sexual exploitative material and its consequences is crucial in reducing its prevalence.

<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the approval of a combination between Girish Sriram Juneja (one of the respondents) and Hindustan National Glass Industries Ltd. (HNGIL), where AGI was being acquired by HNGIL. The objectors, including Independent Sugar Corporation Ltd., raised concerns about the impact on competition.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had approved the combination after considering various factors, including the market share and installed capacity of the companies involved.
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also gave its approval for the sale of HNGIL's shares to AGI.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The objectors argued that the CCI had not properly evaluated the impact on competition and that the combination would lead to a reduction in market share, resulting in higher prices.
They also contended that the NCLT had not taken into account the interests of minority shareholders when approving the sale of HNGIL's shares to AGI.
The respondents, including Girish Sriram Juneja and HNGIL, argued that the CCI had followed proper procedures and that its decision was based on a thorough analysis of the market conditions.
They also claimed that the objectors' concerns were unfounded and that the combination would lead to increased efficiency and competitiveness in the market.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the objectors' arguments about the impact on competition were speculative and not supported by evidence.
The court noted that the CCI had followed proper procedures and that its decision was based on a thorough analysis of the market conditions.
The NCLT's approval for the sale of HNGIL's shares to AGI was also upheld, with the court finding no fault in the process followed by the tribunal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals filed by the objectors, upholding the decisions of the CCI and NCLT.
The court observed that the objectors' concerns about the impact on competition were unfounded and that the combination would lead to increased efficiency and competitiveness in the market.
The judgment noted that the Competition Act, 2002, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, are designed to promote fair competition and ensure efficient resolution of insolvencies.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a contempt petition (C) Nos. 158-159 of 2024, where the petitioner is facing allegations of contumacious conduct in relation to the sale and transfer of a secured asset. The Bank had initiated proceedings against the Borrower for defaulting on loan repayment, resulting in the sale of the Secured Asset through auction. However, the Borrower challenged the validity of the 9th auction proceedings and claimed that the Assignment Agreement dated 28.08.2023 was hit by lis pendens.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner (Bank) argued that the 9th auction proceedings were valid and the sale of the Secured Asset to the petitioner should be confirmed. The Bank also sought directions for cancellation of the Release Deed dated 28.08.2023, withdrawal of S.A. No. 46 of 2022 pending before the DRT, and declaration of the Assignment Agreement dated 28.08.2023 as void.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Borrower's actions were in clear contravention of the orders passed by the Court. The Court also noted that the Assignment Agreement dated 28.08.2023 was hit by lis pendens and should be declared void.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court upheld the legality and validity of the 9th auction proceedings conducted pursuant to the notice of sale dated 12.06.2022. The sale of the Secured Asset to the petitioner was confirmed, and the title conferred through the Sale Certificate dated 27.09.2023 was declared absolute. The Bank was directed to refund the amount of Rs. 129 crore paid by the Borrower towards redemption of mortgage without any interest only after compliance with the aforesaid directions. The Subsequent Transferee was allowed to recover the amount paid by it towards the Assignment Agreement dated 28.08.2023 and any other amount from the Borrower by availing appropriate legal remedy.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Articles 105 and 194 of the Indian Constitution, which relate to the privileges and immunities of members of Parliament. The High Court had passed a judgment that a member of Parliament cannot be prosecuted for bribery if they accept a bribe but ultimately decide not to vote in the agreed direction.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The Supreme Court's reference to the previous judgment in PV Narasimha Rao v. State (Through CBI), which held that a member of Parliament can be prosecuted for bribery even after accepting the bribe, was challenged by the High Court. The Supreme Court had to re-examine this issue and interpret Articles 105 and 194.
The High Court's judgment stated that if a member of Parliament accepts a bribe but does not vote in the agreed direction, they cannot be prosecuted for bribery under Article 105(2) or its corresponding provision in Article 194. The court relied on the phrase "anything which may have been said or incurred" in these articles to justify this conclusion.
The respondents challenged this judgment and argued that it is contrary to the purpose of Articles 105 and 194, which aim to create an environment where debates and deliberations can take place freely within the legislature. They also pointed out that bribery corrupts this process and undermines the integrity of the institution.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court's judgment creates a paradoxical situation: if a member of Parliament accepts a bribe but votes in the agreed direction, they cannot be prosecuted; however, if they accept a bribe but decide not to vote in the agreed direction, they can still be prosecuted. This interpretation is contrary to the text and purpose of Articles 105 and 194.
The court noted that bribery corrupts the legislative process by inducing members to act in ways that are contrary to their conscience or duty.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately held that the High Court's judgment was incorrect. It stated that the words "anything which may have been said or incurred" in Articles 105(2) and 194(2) refer to actions directly related to the speech or vote given, not remotely connected activities.
The court also observed that bribery is a crime that erodes probity in public life and undermines the integrity of institutions like Parliament. Therefore, it cannot be said to be essential to the casting of votes or the ability to decide how to cast them.
In conclusion, the Supreme Court held that members of Parliament can indeed be prosecuted for bribery under Articles 105 and 194, even if they accept a bribe but ultimately do not vote in the agreed direction.
</JUDGMENT>

<FUNCTTIONALITIES_TESTING>
  <FACTS>
The court was considering the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. The petitioners were challenging the denial of input tax credit on the construction of a shopping mall.
  </FACTS>

  <ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d) cannot be given the same meaning as the expression "plant and machinery" defined by the explanation to Section 17. They also contended that a building other than a hotel or a cinema theatre can be classified as a plant within the meaning of the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d).
The court also considered the interpretation of clause (d) of sub-section (5) of Section 17, which provides an exception to the general rule of denying input tax credit on the construction of immovable property.
  </ARGUMENTS>

  <OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the question whether a building other than a hotel or a cinema theatre can be classified as a plant within the meaning of the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d) is a factual question which has to be determined keeping in mind the business of the registered person and the role that building plays in the said business.
The court also noted that the functionality test will have to be applied to decide whether a building is a plant. 
  </OBSERVATIONS>

  <JUDGMENT>
The court held that the challenge to the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the CGST Act was not established. The court also held that a building other than a hotel or a cinema theatre can be classified as a plant within the meaning of the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d), subject to the application of the functionality test.
The court remanded the case to the High Court for limited purposes of deciding whether, in the facts of the case, the shopping mall is a "plant" in terms of clause (d) of Section 17(5).

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the issue of jurisdiction of proper officers to issue show cause notices under Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962. The matter was initially decided by this Court in Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. (Review Petition No. 400/2021). However, the decision was subject to review. The connected Review Petition Nos. 401/2021, 402/2021, and 403/2021 were also part of this case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case focused on the interpretation of Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962. The issue at hand was whether the proper officers had jurisdiction to issue show cause notices under this section. Various High Courts and Tribunals had already considered this matter, with differing opinions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962 grants the Director General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGSTI) and other authorized officers jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute cases under the Central Excise Act, 1944. However, there was a need for clarity on whether these officers could also issue show cause notices under Section 28 of the Customs Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court ultimately allowed the Review Petition No. 400/2021 and the connected petitions insofar as the issue of jurisdiction of proper officers to issue show cause notices under Section 28 was concerned. The decision of the High Court of Delhi rendered in Mangali Impex v. Commissioner of Customs was set aside, and the view taken by the High Court of Bombay in Sunil Gupta v. Commissioner of Customs was upheld. Furthermore, the constitutional validity of Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 was also upheld.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal proceeding against respondent nos. 3, 4, and 5 for registering a false case under the Excise Act. The alleged conspiracy to murder was registered at Murar Police Station, Gwalior. Respondent no. 1 is also accused of being involved in the conspiracy. The High Court had quashed the criminal proceedings pending before the CJM, Firozabad.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the High Court erred in quashing the criminal proceedings without considering whether sanction for prosecution under Section 197 CrPC was required or not. The defence also raised objections regarding the requirement of sanction for proceeding against respondent nos. 3, 4, and 5.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was a legitimate doubt as regards whether sanction for prosecution under Section 197 CrPC is required or not. The progress of the trial should not be hampered or unnecessarily delayed. The CJM, Firozabad had rightly taken cognizance of the two charge sheets.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the Trial Court to proceed with the trial and conclude it expeditiously preferably within one year from the date of the order. If the evidence suggests that the acts complained of were indeed done or purported to be done in the discharge of official duty by respondent nos. 3, 4, and 5 respectively, the trial may be stayed for want of sanction. The question of sanction only qua respondent nos. 3, 4, and 5 respectively is left open to be appropriately decided by the Trial Court at a suitable stage.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around a complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I. Act) against a respondent bank in Chandigarh. The petitioner argues that the court in Chandigarh lacks jurisdiction to entertain the case, as no part of the cause of action arose within Chandigarh. The enactment of sub-section (2)(a) of Section 142 of the N.I. Act and the Explanation thereto allows the complainant to file a complaint before the courts within whose jurisdiction the collection branch of the bank falls.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The petitioner's main arguments are:
1. The court in Chandigarh lacks territorial jurisdiction to try the case under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, as no part of the cause of action arose within Chandigarh.
2. Although the Court in Chandigarh has the territorial jurisdiction to try the case under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, the proceedings deserve to be transferred to the Court in Delhi due to two situations for the petitioner:
   (i) language barrier
   (ii) convenience.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the court include:
1. The enactment of sub-section (2)(a) of Section 142 of the N.I. Act and the Explanation thereto allows the complainant to file a complaint before the courts within whose jurisdiction the collection branch of the bank falls.
2. The word 'delivered' used in Section 142(2)(a) of the N.I. Act has no significance, and what is significant is the expression 'for collection through an account'.
3. Delivery of the cheque takes place where the cheque was issued, and presentation of the cheque will be through the account of the payee or holder in due course.
4. The place where the presentation of the cheque is decisive to determine the question of jurisdiction.
5. The argument that no part of the cause of action could be said to have arisen within Chandigarh is of no avail to them, more particularly when the law itself allows the institution of a complaint in Chandigarh.
</Observations>

<Judgment>
The court's judgment is as follows:
1. No case is made out for transfer of the proceedings in question under 406 CrPC.
2. The petition fails and is hereby dismissed.
3. All other connected transfer petitions are also disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
</Judgment>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the power of judicial review in cases of arrest under Special Acts, specifically the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the Customs Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court argued that the power of judicial review should be exercised cautiously to balance individual liberty with the interest of justice and society. 
It emphasized that frequent or casual interference by courts in the functioning of authorized officers may embolden unscrupulous elements to commit crimes, thereby frustrating the objectives of the Special Acts.
The court also highlighted that minor procedural lapses on the part of authorized officers should not be magnified by the courts in exercise of judicial review powers, which may ultimately grant undue advantage or benefit to persons accused of serious offenses under the special Acts.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the Special Acts are enacted to achieve specific purposes and objectives. It noted that the offenses under these acts are of a very serious nature affecting financial systems and the sovereignty and integrity of the nation.
The court also mentioned that with advancements in technology, crimes have become more intricate and complicated, making minor procedural lapses on the part of authorized officers less significant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the power of judicial review may not be exercised unless there is manifest arbitrariness or gross violation or non-compliance of statutory safeguards provided under the special Acts.
The court emphasized that its primary concern was to strike a balance between individual liberty and the interest of justice, and that the exercise of judicial review powers should not lead to judicial overreach or undermining the powers of statutory authorities.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Madarsa Act was enacted to regulate the standard of education in Madarsas recognized by the Board for imparting Madarsa education. The Act aimed to improve the merit and provide adequate facilities to students studying in these institutions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had earlier disagreed with the petitioners on several contentions, including the principle of secularism. The only infirmity lies in those provisions which pertain to higher education, namely Fazil and Kamil. These provisions can be severed from the rest of the Madarsa Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The purpose behind the Madarsa Act was to remove difficulties in running the Madarsas, improve their merit, and provide adequate facilities to students studying in these institutions. The legislature would have still enacted the statute if it were aware that the portions pertaining to higher education were invalid.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

a. The Madarsa Act regulates the standard of education in Madarsas recognized by the Board for imparting Madarsa education.

b. The Madarsa Act is consistent with the positive obligation of the State to ensure that students studying in recognized Madarsas attain a level of competency which will allow them to effectively participate in society and earn a living.

c. Article 21-A and the RTE Act have to be read consistently with the right of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

d. The Board with the approval of the State government can enact regulations to ensure that religious minority institutions impart secular education of a requisite standard without destroying their minority character.

e. The Madarsa Act is within the legislative competence of the State legislature and traceable to Entry 25 of List III. However, the provisions of the Madarsa Act which seek to regulate higher-education degrees, such as Fazil and Kamil are unconstitutional as they are in conflict with the UGC Act, which has been enacted under Entry 66 of List I.

The judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 22 March 2024 is accordingly set aside and the petitions shall stand disposed of in the above terms.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the imposition of service tax on sole distributors/purchasers of lottery tickets by the State Government. The respondents-assessees are sole distributors/purchasers who buy lottery tickets at a wholesale price from the State Government and sell them at a higher price to retailers. The Central Government has been attempting to impose service tax on these transactions, but the amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, have been unsuccessful in deterring this.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the respondents-assessees are that the relationship between the State Government and the sole distributors/purchasers is one of principal to principal, not principal-agent. As a result, no service tax is leviable on the transactions between them. The Central Government has attempted to impose service tax through various amendments to the Finance Act, 1994, but these efforts have been unsuccessful.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observes that at each stage, the amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, in order to impose service tax on the sole distributors/purchasers of lottery tickets have been unsuccessful. The relationship between the State Government and the sole distributors/purchasers is one of principal to principal, not principal-agent.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismisses the appeals filed by the Union of India and others, upholding the decision of the Sikkim High Court that service tax is not leviable on the transactions between the sole distributors/purchasers (respondents-assessees) and the Government of Sikkim. The appeal filed by the assessee is disposed accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Rule 2(k) of the CENVAT Rules, which defines "input" for the purpose of credit benefits. The main issue is whether towers and pre-fabricated buildings (PFBs) used by Mobile Service Providers (MSPs) for providing mobile telecommunication services qualify as "inputs".
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The Delhi High Court's judgment in Vodafone (supra), which held that towers and PFBs are "goods" and not immovable property, and therefore qualify as "inputs" under Rule 2(k).
* The Bombay High Court's judgment in Bharti Airtel (supra), which rejected the plea of the Assessee that towers and parts thereof are inputs under Rule 2(k) by observing that the towers are admittedly immovable structures and hence ipso facto non-marketable and non-excisable.
* The CESTAT's rejection of the plea of the Assessee that towers and parts thereof are inputs under Rule 2(k) by relying on Explanation-2 to Rule 2(k).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:

* The importance of accurately interpreting Rule 2(k) for determining what constitutes "inputs" under the CENVAT Rules.
* The distinction between movable and immovable property, and its relevance to the interpretation of Rule 2(k).
* The role of Explanation-2 to Rule 2(k) in providing guidance on the definition of "input".
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The final judgment is in favor of the Assessee, upholding the Delhi High Court's judgment in Vodafone (supra). The court sets aside the Bombay High Court's judgment in Bharti Airtel (supra) and allows the connected appeals. Consequently, all the appeals and connected applications are disposed of in terms of the above findings and conclusions.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case pertains to the eligibility of visually impaired candidates for appointment in judicial service. The Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994 were challenged by various petitioners who claimed that they were discriminated against due to their visual impairment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioners emphasized the need to amend Rule 6A and Rule 7 of the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994. They claimed that these rules were discriminatory towards visually impaired candidates, as they required them to meet higher standards than their able-bodied counterparts.
The respondents argued that the rules were in accordance with the existing laws and that there was no necessity to make any changes. However, it was also acknowledged that separate cut-offs should be maintained for visually-impaired candidates as per the judgment in Indra Sawhney.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court included the importance of ensuring equal opportunities for persons with disabilities in employment and specifically in respect of judicial service. The court noted that there can be no distinction between Persons with Disabilities (PwD) and Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD).
The court also observed that the existing rules did not provide adequate relaxation to visually impaired candidates, which led to their exclusion from participating in the selection process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that visually impaired candidates are eligible to participate in the selection for judicial service and thus struck down Rule 6A of the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994. 
Additionally, Rule 7 was struck down to the extent it prescribed additional requirements for PwD candidates.
The court directed that separate cut-offs be maintained for visually-impaired candidates in line with the judgment in Indra Sawhney.

Finally, the court ordered that the respective authorities proceed with the selection process and complete the same within a period of three months. 
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an application for grant of anticipatory bail by an accused who is already in judicial custody in a different offence. The issue at hand is the maintainability of such an application under the scheme of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The High Court had passed an order holding that the application was not maintainable.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant, represented by Mr. Luthra, argued that the issue has already been dealt with and decided by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra). It was contended that the dictum laid therein is that an anticipatory bail application filed by an accused in a different case, while he is in custody in one case, would not be maintainable. However, it was argued that the crux of the grievance of the Petitioners in the said case was that they were being detained in prison on the strength of a production warrant in another matter.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that this Court in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra) had no occasion to go into the question of maintainability of an application for grant of anticipatory bail by an accused who is already in judicial custody in relation to some offence. The High Court also noted that it was examining the issue whether a blanket order in the nature of anticipatory bail could be passed by this Court in exercise of its Writ Jurisdiction.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The three-Judge Bench held that an application for grant of anticipatory bail is maintainable under the scheme of the CrPC, even if the accused is already in judicial custody in a different offence. However, each such application will have to be decided by the competent courts on their own merits. The High Court was directed to proceed and decide the anticipatory bail application filed by the respondent accused on its own merits. 
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an auction of a subject property under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The Auction Purchaser participated in the e-auction, which was conducted by the Liquidator. The Auction Purchaser bid ₹29,55,96,375 for the subject property. The subject property's average liquidation value was estimated to be ₹39,41,28,800.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant (the original owner of the subject property) argued that the sale should be set aside due to irregularities in the auction process. However, the Respondents (the Auction Purchaser and others) contended that the Appellant had delayed taking action against them and that the auction was conducted fairly.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that once an auction is confirmed, it should be interfered with only on limited grounds. The court also noted that repeated interferences in public auctions can cause uncertainty and frustrate the purpose of holding auctions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the sale should not be set aside but rather that the Auction Purchaser should deposit an additional amount for retaining the balance sale consideration for over six months. The court directed the Auction Purchaser to pay 50% of the differential figure, which was approximately ₹5,00,00,000 with interest @ 9 % p.a. reckoned from 26th March, 2020.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over land ownership, with the appellants seeking compensation for their land that was acquired by the respondents. The land in question is approximately three acres and has been the subject of litigation for thirty years.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' right to property is recognized as a basic human right, essential for safeguarding against tyranny and economic oppression by the government (as per Delhi Airtech Services Pvt. Ltd. v. State of U.P.). The court also cites previous judgments that emphasize the need for specific legal authority to deprive a person of their property under Article 300-A of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court recognizes that the Executive cannot deprive a person of their property without specific legal authority, and in the absence of such authority, the owner may obtain restoration of possession through a mandamus. The court also notes that the phrase "by authority of law" means by or under a law made by a competent Legislature.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the respondents to pay an amount of Rs. 70 lakhs towards compensation to the appellants within three months from the date of judgment. The Registry is also directed to circulate one copy each of this judgment to all High Courts across the country and one copy each to all Chief Secretaries of respective State Governments.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, who has been arrested and charged under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). He was arrested in connection with a case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on August 22, 2022. The arrest was made after the ED found "reasons to believe" that Kejriwal had allegedly laundered money worth over Rs 100 crore. However, the court notes that the reasons for this belief are not clear and require further investigation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for Arvind Kejriwal argued that the arrest was arbitrary and made without proper grounds. The court also notes that the "reasons to believe" mentioned in the ED's FIR are vague and do not provide sufficient justification for the arrest.

The court then refers two questions to a larger Bench, which include:

1. Whether the "need and necessity to arrest" under Section 13 of the PMLA refers to formal parameters or personal grounds.
2. If the answer is in the affirmative, what are the parameters and facts that should be considered while examining the question of "need and necessity to arrest".

The court also notes that Arvind Kejriwal has suffered over 90 days of incarceration and grants him interim bail on certain conditions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that there is a need for clarity in the application of Section 13 of the PMLA, which deals with the power to arrest. The court also notes that Arvind Kejriwal's role as an elected leader and Chief Minister of Delhi should be taken into consideration when imposing conditions on his bail.

The court further observes that it is not clear whether the court can direct an elected leader to step down or not function as a Minister.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court grants Arvind Kejriwal interim bail on certain conditions, including:

1. Furnishing of bail bonds in the sum of Rs 50,000 with one surety of like amount to the satisfaction of the Jail Superintendent.
2. Not visiting the Office of the Chief Minister and the Delhi Secretariat.
3. Being bound by the statement made on his behalf that he shall not sign official files unless required for obtaining clearance/approval of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.
4. Not making any comment with regard to his role in the present case.
5. Not interacting with any of the witnesses or having access to any official files connected with the case.

The court refers two questions to a larger Bench, which include:

1. Whether the "need and necessity to arrest" under Section 13 of the PMLA refers to formal parameters or personal grounds.
2. If the answer is in the affirmative, what are the parameters and facts that should be considered while examining the question of "need and necessity to arrest".

The court orders the Registry to place the matter before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench, which may include a Constitution Bench, for consideration of the aforesaid questions.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the CGST Act. The petitioners, in Writ Petitions, challenged the constitutional validity of these sections.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the petitioners and respondents are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the petitioners argued against the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4), while the respondents defended their constitutionality.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d) cannot be given the same meaning as the expression "plant and machinery" defined by the explanation to Section 17. The court also noted that the question of whether a building other than a hotel or cinema theatre can be classified as a plant within the meaning of Section 17(5)(d) is a factual question that needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4). However, it clarified that the interpretation of clause (d) of sub-section (5) of Section 17 should be in line with its judgment. The court also set aside the impugned judgment in Civil Appeal Nos. 2948 and 2949 of 2023 and remanded the writ petitions to the High Court of Orissa for limited purposes of deciding whether, in the facts of the case, the shopping mall is a "plant" in terms of clause (d) of Section 17(5).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellants and the respondent-CBI regarding the mining of coal in a captive mine. The appellants had submitted a Revised Mining Plan to the MoC, which was approved in 2011. The CAG Audit Report highlighted discrepancies in the management of the coal rejects, leading to an investigation by the respondent-CBI.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the respondent-CBI embarked on a "roving and fishing inquiry" based on the Audit Report, without proper evidence or justification. They claimed that the CAG report had not attained finality and was still pending. The appellants also stated that the washing of raw coal was a necessary process to meet the specified grade for power generation.
The respondent-CBI argued that the Audit Report revealed serious irregularities in the management of coal rejects, which suggested a conspiracy by the appellants to profit from the sale of these rejects.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the respondent-CBI's investigation was based on an incomplete and inaccurate interpretation of the agreements between the parties. The court also noted that the new technology for utilizing coal rejects, namely FBC, was not even in vogue when the original Mining Plan was approved.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the respondent-CBI's investigation was unjustified and that the impugned orders were unsustainable. The court quashed and set aside the order on charge dated 24th December, 2021 and the order framing charges dated 3rd March, 2022 passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the rejection of a challenge to the sanction for prosecution under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The appellant is a director of a company accused of committing an offence. The question is whether Section 22A applies to the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments raised by the appellant include:
* The validity of sanction should be challenged at the earliest instance available, before the Trial Court.
* The timelines mentioned in Rules 3 & 4 of the 2008 Rules are couched in mandatory language and must be strictly followed to prevent misuse of the right of challenge.
* Sections 218-222, CrPC, are not violated. However, Section 223 is a matter for the Trial Court to decide if raised before it.
* The exemption under Section 22A applies only if the person claiming such exemption demonstrates that they were not in charge of the affairs of the company or made reasonable efforts to prevent the commission of the offence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court include:
* There is no record of any appeal being filed against the order rejecting the challenge to sanction, and therefore the present appeal lacks merit.
* The timelines mentioned in Rules 3 & 4 of the 2008 Rules are mandatory and must be strictly followed to prevent misuse of the right of challenge.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Court is as follows:
* The appeal lacks merit and is dismissed.
* The pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
* The Trial Court should consider whether Section 223 is violated and whether the exemption under Section 22A applies.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the Union of India and the respondent regarding the liability to pay property tax on an enemy property vested in the Custodian for Enemy Property in India. The respondent had occupied the subject property, which was an enemy property, and the High Court had held that the respondent was not liable to pay any property tax or other local taxes to the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but it can be inferred that the Union of India argued that they were entitled to collect property tax on the enemy property as per Article 285(1) of the Constitution. On the other hand, the respondent argued that they were exempt from paying any taxes on the property as per the provisions of the Enemy Property Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Custodian for Enemy Property in India does not acquire ownership of enemy properties but only acts as a trustee for their management and administration. The vesting of enemy properties in the Custodian is a temporary measure, and they can be divested to the owner or another person upon reference or complaint.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that Article 285(1) does not apply to enemy properties as they are not Union properties. Therefore, the High Court's order holding that the respondent was exempt from paying any taxes on the property was set aside. The Court allowed the appeal and directed that the appellant be entitled to levy and collect property tax as well as water tax and sewerage charges on the subject property from the current fiscal year onwards.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute over forest land, with the plaintiff seeking a declaration of title and permanent injunction to restrain the defendants from interfering with possession. The plaintiff's application for denotification was rejected by the Government, and the Forest Settlement Officer concluded proceedings under the A.P. Forest Act in 1971. The High Court had earlier given a clear finding that even at the time of declaration under the A.P. Land Revenue Act, 1317 F, these lands were not shown as private lands by the defendant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff's arguments are unclear from the provided text, but it can be inferred that they sought to establish their title to the land and prevent the defendants from interfering with possession. The defendants' arguments likely centered around the validity of the proceedings under the A.P. Forest Act and the applicability of Section 87 of the A.P. Land Revenue Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's judgment was set aside by the Supreme Court, which found that the High Court had exceeded its statutory limitations and gifted forest land to a private person who could not prove their title. The Supreme Court also noted that the proceedings under the A.P. Forest Act had become final and conclusive in view of the express declaration provided under Section 16 of the Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment, and restored the judgment rendered in A.S. No. 145 of 1994. The court imposed costs of Rs. 5,00,000/- each on appellants and respondents to be paid to the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) within a period of two months from the date of the judgment.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the original plaintiff's claim against the defendant company for dues owed. The defendant company was declared a sick company under the 1985 Act and was undergoing BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) proceedings. The suit instituted by the original plaintiff was not hit by the embargo envisaged under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are related to the applicability of interest provisions under the 1993 Act and whether the defendant company's withholding of payment can be considered wilful and intentional. The court was required to determine whether the period during which the defendant company was a sick company should be excluded for the purposes of calculating interest.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the liability of the original defendants was disputed and finally adjudicated only after the BIFR proceedings had come to an end. Even if the liability was acknowledged, recovery of the same could not have been done without the permission of the BIFR in view of the suspension of recovery proceedings by Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment and order were upheld subject to modification. The interest was calculated at 24% p.a. with monthly compounding, excluding the period during which the defendant company was a sick company under the 1985 Act. The final amount to be determined in accordance with the final decree had to be paid to the original plaintiff within a period of 4 weeks from the date of judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The petitioner seeks to determine the seat of arbitration for an international commercial arbitration agreement. The agreement designates a place of arbitration but does not explicitly mention a "seat" or "curial law". The parties have also stipulated a venue in the agreement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argues that the express designation of a place of arbitration in the agreement is sufficient to determine the seat of arbitration. They contend that the use of the term "venue" instead of "seat" or "curial law" does not negate the intent of the parties to anchor the arbitral proceedings to the designated place.
The respondent, on the other hand, argues that the Closest Connection Test should be applied to determine the seat of arbitration. They contend that the agreement lacks a clear designation of a seat or curial law and that the parties' intentions are unclear.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observes that the expression "venue" is often used interchangeably with "seat" in arbitration agreements. However, the court notes that the distinction between the two terms can be significant in determining the seat of arbitration.
The court also notes that the Closest Connection Test may not always be applicable where there is an express designation of a place of arbitration.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court holds that the express designation of a place of arbitration in the agreement is sufficient to determine the seat of arbitration. The court finds that the use of the term "venue" does not negate the intent of the parties to anchor the arbitral proceedings to the designated place.
The court dismisses the petition, holding that neither the seat of arbitration nor the arbitration agreement is governed by Indian law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the interpretation of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and its provisions regarding the driving licenses for Light Motor Vehicles (LMVs) and Transport Vehicles. The main issue is whether a driver holding an LMV license can operate a Transport Vehicle without needing additional authorization.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court discusses various sections of the MV Act, including Section 10(2)(d), which deals with LMV licenses for vehicles under 7,500 kg, and Section 10(2)(e), which specifically mentions Transport Vehicles. The court also considers the definition of LMVs in Section 2(21) of the MV Act.
The court notes that there is an overlap between LMVs and Transport Vehicles, but emphasizes that special eligibility requirements will continue to apply for certain vehicles like e-carts, e-rickshaws, and those carrying hazardous goods.
The court also considers a previous judgment in Mukund Dewangan (2017) and its relevance to the current case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
None mentioned
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes that a driver holding an LMV license can operate a Transport Vehicle without additional authorization, provided the gross vehicle weight is under 7,500 kg. The court emphasizes that the licensing regime will not compromise road safety concerns and will address the livelihood issues of drivers operating Transport Vehicles with their LMV licenses.
The court upholds its previous judgment in Mukund Dewangan (2017) but provides reasons for its decision, stating that it is not per incuriam despite certain provisions being overlooked.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioners challenged the final Select List dated 10.03.2023 for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service on the ground that it was contrary to the principle of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' as stipulated in Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that accepting their contention would completely obliterate the fine distinction between the two categories of promotion in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge by way of 65% promotion on the basis of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' and 10% promotion strictly on the basis of merit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the four components of the Suitability Test as prescribed under the recruitment notice dated 12.04.2022 comprehensively evaluate (i) the legal knowledge including knowledge of the case law through the objective MCQ-based written test AND (ii) the continued efficiency by evaluation of the ACRs, average disposal and past judgments of the concerned judicial officer.
The Court also noted that deviating from the process of promotion duly followed by the High Court of Gujarat since 2011 would cause grave prejudice to those judicial officers who lost out in the previous selections to the Higher Judicial Service despite having scored higher marks in the suitability test.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the impugned final Select List dated 10.03.2023 is not contrary to the principle of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' as stipulated in Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules.
The petition failed and was hereby dismissed, with the interim order granted earlier standing vacated.
The parties were ordered to bear their own costs, and pending application(s), if any, stood disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the trial of a judicial officer who allegedly failed to comply with mandatory provisions in two cases. The trials were conducted in record time, and the accused was not given sufficient opportunity to consult his lawyer or receive copies of documents.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the trial court failed to follow the mandatory provisions under the POCSO Act, 2012, including providing adequate opportunity for the accused to defend himself. The defense counsel for the judicial officer argued that the decisions relied upon by the prosecution have no bearing on the present case and that there was no proposed action against the judicial officer.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that it is humanly impossible to deliver a judgment within half an hour's time, running into 27 pages consisting of 59 paragraphs. The court also noted that the accused was not able to consult his lawyer and was not served with copies of documents, despite his lawyer receiving them before framing of charges.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals stand dismissed with directions for the trial court to keep in mind the mandate of POCSO Act, 2012 while recording evidence. The government is directed to file an affidavit on the feasibility of introducing a comprehensive sentencing policy within six months. The registry is also directed to forward a copy of this judgment to the Department of Justice.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the validity of Clause 6.0, Chapter VI of the Guidelines dated 08.08.2008 and its subsequent amendment. The clause in question restricts the number of audits a Chartered Accountant can undertake under Section 44AB of the IT Act, 1961. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that Clause 6.0, Chapter VI of the Guidelines dated 08.08.2008 and its subsequent amendment is a reasonable restriction on the right to practice the profession by a Chartered Accountant and is protected or justifiable under Article 19(6) of the Constitution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the corporate governance agenda garners attention only during times when the country is faced with corporate scams. Shareholder democracy has come to stay, and Chartered Accountants are the gatekeepers of this new corporate world, which poses challenges as well as unprecedented opportunities.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that Clause 6.0, Chapter VI of the Guidelines dated 08.08.2008 and its subsequent amendment is valid and not violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution as it is a reasonable restriction on the right to practice the profession by a Chartered Accountant. However, the court deemed that the clause would not be given effect until 01.04.2024. Consequently, all proceedings initiated pursuant to the impugned Guideline in respect of the writ petitioners and other similarly situated Chartered Accountants stand quashed.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the appeals filed by the Airports Authority of India (AERA) against orders made by the Tribunal for Inter-State Disputes (TDSAT). The AERA challenged certain decisions and directions given by TDSAT. The issue at hand is whether AERA can file an appeal under Section 31 of the AERA Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case revolve around the interpretation of various sections of the AERA Act, specifically Sections 17(1)(b) and 18(5). The key points include:
* The determination of tariff for aeronautical services is one of the functions discharged by AERA.
* TDSAT has the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of appeals against any direction, decision or order of the Authority under this Act.
* Section 18(5) requires that a copy of the order of TDSAT must be given to AERA even if it is not a party to the appeal or the dispute.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The determination of tariff for aeronautical services is merely one of the functions discharged by AERA, and other functions are handled by TDSAT.
* Section 17(1)(b) grants TDSAT jurisdiction to hear and dispose of appeals against any direction, decision or order of the Authority under this Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment made in this case is as follows:
"The Registry shall list the matters before the Regular Bench for adjudication of the appeals on merits. In view of the discussion above, the appeals filed by AERA against orders of TDSAT under Section 31 of the AERA Act are maintainable."

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves three appellants who were wrongly convicted and sentenced by the High Court. The appellants alleged that they were subjected to inhuman treatment during their detention, including being kept in a police lock-up for 30 days without any legal proceedings against them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the appellants was that they were wrongly convicted and sentenced due to the mishandling of the case by the Public Prosecutor. They alleged that the Public Prosecutor had suppressed material evidence, which could have led to their acquittal.
Additionally, the appellants argued that the State Government was responsible for appointing a competent Public Prosecutor, who could have ensured that justice was delivered in their case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Public Prosecutor had failed to discharge his duties fairly and impartially. The Court noted that the Public Prosecutor had suppressed material evidence and presented a one-sided picture of the case.
The Court also observed that the State Government was responsible for appointing a competent Public Prosecutor, who could have ensured that justice was delivered in the appellants' case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals of the three appellants and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. The Court ordered the State Government to pay a compensation of Rs. 5,00,000/- each to the three appellants within a period of four weeks from the date of the order.
The bail bonds furnished by the appellants stood discharged, and the Registry was directed to notify the matter once again before the Bench after four weeks to report compliance of payment of compensation as awarded.

<Facts>
The case revolves around the selection of a candidate in 1998, and the appellants have continuously held office for over twenty-five years under interim orders. The matter pertains to an alleged bias in the decision-making process.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The principle of audi alteram partem is essential in ensuring justice and safeguarding against arbitrary decision-making, particularly in cases with unequal power dynamics. A fair and transparent procedure must be followed, allowing concerned parties to present their case, provide evidence, and clarify any misgivings regarding the decision-making process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
An ineffective hearing at the initial stage taints the entire decision-making process, leading to flawed orders at subsequent stages. Providing a hearing to affected individuals minimizes the risk of administrative authorities making decisions in ignorance of facts or other relevant circumstances. The primary purpose of natural justice is to assist administration in reaching sound decisions at the outset.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upholds the opinion of Justice KV Vishwanathan, allowing the appeal(s) and setting aside the judgment of the Division Bench. However, considering that one of the appellants has already superannuated, remanding the matter for a fresh inquiry would be impractical. The time lag can be better appreciated in this context.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a legal dispute regarding the interpretation of the Motor Vehicles Act (MV Act) and the rules framed thereunder. The issue at hand is whether a driver holding a license for Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) class can operate a Transport Vehicle without needing additional authorization.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's main argument is that the LMV driving license holder can drive a "Transport Vehicle" as long as the gross vehicle weight does not exceed 7,500 kg. The respondents argued that the second part of Section 3(1) emphasizes the necessity of a specific requirement to drive a 'Transport Vehicle' and thus, the petitioner's driver needs additional authorization.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that none of the parties in this case has produced any empirical data to demonstrate that the LMV driving license holder, driving a ‘Transport Vehicle’, is a significant cause for road accidents in India. The court also observed that such harmonious interpretation will substantially address the vexed question of law before it.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

(I) A driver holding a license for Light Motor Vehicle (LMV) class, under Section 10(2)(d) for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight under 7,500 kg, is permitted to operate a ‘Transport    Vehicle’ without needing additional authorization under Section 10(2)(e) of the MV Act specifically for the ‘Transport Vehicle’ class.

(II) The second part of Section 3(1), which emphasizes the necessity of a specific requirement to drive a ‘Transport Vehicle,’ does not supersede the definition of LMV provided in Section 2(21) of the MV Act.

(III) The additional eligibility criteria specified in the MV Act and MV Rules generally for driving ‘transport vehicles’ would apply only to those intending to operate vehicles with gross vehicle weight exceeding 7,500 kg i.e. ‘medium goods vehicle’, ‘medium passenger vehicle’, ‘heavy goods vehicle’ and ‘heavy passenger vehicle’.

(IV) The decision in Mukund Dewangan (2017) is upheld but for reasons as explained by the court in this judgment.

The reference was answered in the above terms.

The case involves an appeal by the appellant against the order of the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara rejecting their application for compounding an offence under Section 276CC of the Income-tax Act, 1961 for the Assessment Year 2013-14. The appellant had filed a writ petition in the High Court against the rejection order, which was also dismissed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments made by the appellant include that the offence as alleged to have been committed by them is covered under the expression "first offence" as defined under the 2014 guidelines for compounding of offences. Therefore, the compounding application could not have been rejected on this ground alone.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include that the Guidelines for Compounding of Offences under Direct Tax Laws, 2019 and the Guidelines for Compounding of Offences under Direct Tax Laws, 2022 issued by the CBDT indicate a clear shift in policy to make the compounding regime more flexible and liberal. The restrictions laid down in Paragraph 8 of the guidelines are not absolute but can be made an exception in peculiar cases where the facts and circumstances so require.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the High Court fell in error in rejecting the writ petition filed by the appellant against the order passed by the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara rejecting the application for compounding. The impugned orders are hereby set aside, and the appellant shall prefer a fresh application for compounding within two weeks from the date of this judgment. The proceedings pending before the Trial Court shall remain stayed pending the decision of the competent authority on the compounding application.

<FACTS>
The plaintiff has filed a suit against the Union of India, raising the legal issue as to whether after withdrawal of the consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, the CBI via the defendant – Union of India can continue to register and investigate cases in its area in violation of the provisions of Section 6 of the DSPE Act.
The plaintiff has alleged that the CBI cannot exercise its powers in any State unless the three conditions under Sections 3, 5, and 6 of the DSPE Act are fulfilled. The plaintiff has claimed that after withdrawal of the consent by the plaintiff on November 16, 2018, the CBI could not have continued to register cases and exercise its powers under the DSPE Act.
The suit is listed for framing of issues on August 13, 2024.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defendant – Union of India has raised various contentions challenging the maintainability of the suit. The defendant has argued that the CBI is a constitutional body and has the power to investigate cases in any State without the consent of the State Government.
The defendant has also argued that the DSPE Act does not require the consent of the State Government for the exercise of powers by the CBI in the concerned State.
The defendant has further argued that even if the consent was withdrawn, the CBI had already been exercising its powers under the DSPE Act and could not be stopped from doing so without a court order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court has observed that the averments in the plaint cannot be read in isolation but are to be read in entirety. The plaintiff has claimed that the CBI is established by the defendant, its exercise of powers is controlled by the defendant, and its functioning is also under the superintendence of the defendant.
The Court has noted that the legal right of the States consists in their immunity, in the sense of freedom from the power of the Union Government.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court has rejected the preliminary objection raised by the defendant and held that the suit is maintainable. The Court has clarified that its findings are for the purposes of deciding the preliminary objection and will have no bearing on the merits of the suit.
The Court has listed the suit for framing of issues on August 13, 2024.

Non-bailable warrants were also issued against Manager Singh in this case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court observed that the non-bailable warrants were issued without following the procedure and that the trial court should have fixed terms and conditions for the release of Manager Singh on bail before issuing non-bailable warrants.
The court further noted that the direction given by the High Court in its order dated 09.01.2020 restricting the grant of anticipatory bail till the filing of the chargesheet was not applicable in this case due to the peculiar facts.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Special Chief Judicial Magistrate had issued non-bailable warrants without following the proper procedure, which is a violation of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
The court also noted that the trial court had failed to fix terms and conditions for the release of Manager Singh on bail before issuing non-bailable warrants.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
(i) The appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 1074/2017 preferred by Sharif Ahmed and Adil is allowed, and the criminal proceedings are quashed.

(ii) The appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 5419/2022 is allowed with a direction that in the event of being arrested, the appellants – Imran and Kamaluddin shall be released on anticipatory bail in connection with the chargesheet under Sections 420 and 120B IPC arising out of FIR No. 519/2019 dated 26.07.2019 registered at Police Station Chandpur, District Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh on terms and conditions to be fixed by the trial court.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a complaint filed under the Code, which was presented before a Special Court presided by a Sessions Judge. The respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had challenged the jurisdiction of this court to try the complaint, claiming that only a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class had jurisdiction to do so.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case were:

* Whether the reference in Section 236(1) of the Code is a 'legislation by incorporation' or 'legislation by reference'.
* Whether the Special Courts presided by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge have jurisdiction to try complaints under the Code.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations made in the case include:

* The court noted that if the legislative intent was to give effect to subsequent amendments in the Companies Act to Section 236(1) of the Code, nothing prevented the legislature from amending Section 236(1) of the Code.
* The court also observed that even if it is held that the reference in Section 236(1) of the Code is a 'legislation by reference' and not 'legislation by incorporation', still the offences punishable under the Code having imprisonment of two years or more will have to be tried by a Special Court presided by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in the case states:

* The impugned judgment and order dated 14th February 2022, passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ Petition No.2592 of 2021 is quashed and set aside.
* It is held that the Special Court presided by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge will have jurisdiction to try the complaint under the Code.
* Since the learned single judge of the High Court has not considered the merits of the matter, the matter is remitted to the learned single judge of the High Court for considering the petition of the respondents afresh on merits.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an FIR (First Information Report) filed in Jamnagar, India. The report was registered with the City A-Division Police Station on a complaint that a poem had caused animosity and hatred amongst different communities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argues that freedom of expression is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The judges emphasize that without this freedom, it's impossible to lead a dignified life as per Article 21 of the Constitution.
They also mention that even if a large number of people dislike certain views expressed by another individual or group, the right of the person to express those views must be respected and protected.
The court further states that there is no blanket rule that puts an embargo on the powers of the High Court to quash FIRs only because the investigation was at a nascent stage. They argue that the High Court can exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution or Section 482 of the CrPC ( equivalent to Section 528 of the BNSS) to prevent abuse of process of law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that even if they, as judges, may not like certain spoken or written words, it is their duty to uphold the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a). They note that the police or executive have failed to honor and protect this fundamental right in some cases.
They also mention that subscribing to a view that mere recital of a poem or art can lead to animosity or hatred amongst communities would stifle all legitimate expressions of views in the public domain, which is fundamental to a free society.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court sets aside the impugned order and quashes FIR No. 11202008250014 of 2025 registered with City A-Division Police Station, Jamnagar. They also quash and set aside further proceedings based on this FIR. The Appeal is accordingly allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiff registered a document as a gift, which was handed over by Defendant No.1. The defendants contested that the document was not accepted by the plaintiff until later and therefore it is invalid. However, the trial Court found that the document was acted upon during the lifetime of the executant, indicating acceptance.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court relied on previous judgments (Daulat Singh case) which stated that possession of a gift itself amounts to acceptance. The court also considered Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which states that a gift is a transfer of property without consideration.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The document was categorized as a "gift" and not a Will. The reasons for cancellation or revocation of the gift had to be proved in a court of law. The unilateral cancellation of the document was deemed void, making the subsequent sale deed invalid.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court set aside the concurrent judgments of the Courts below and treated the document as a "settlement". This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in this appeal. The judgment confirms that the document is a settlement, not a Will.

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court relied on international law and emphasized the importance of compliance with principles of law and procedural rigors in criminal trials. They highlighted the need for expedited trials, particularly in cases involving serious crimes like murder.
The court also mentioned that the prosecution's lackadaisical approach to conducting the trial was unacceptable. The case had been adjourned multiple times due to non-production of witnesses, with only one witness examined over a period of 2.3 years.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the trial process must be free from procedural irregularities and blemishes that may question the credibility of the conclusion arrived at by such a process. They also noted that the examination of witnesses and smooth conduct of the trial are essential in matters like this.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the judgments of the Trial Court convicting the accused and awarding capital punishment, and confirmed thereof by the High Court. The case was remanded to the Trial Court and restored on the respective docket. The Trial Court was directed to proceed afresh from the stage of framing of charge.

Arguments are not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it can be inferred that the appellants sought to quash the criminal proceedings against them, alleging procedural irregularities and a lack of sufficient evidence.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the High Court had directed the grant of anticipatory bail with certain conditions. The appeals filed by Imran and Kamaluddin (SLP (Crl.) No. 5419/2022) sought to modify this direction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court include:

*   Non-bailable warrants were issued against Manager Singh, but there was no justification for such action.
*   The High Court's direction restricting the grant of anticipatory bail till the filing of the chargesheet is modified in light of the peculiar facts of the case.
*   The trial court should fix terms and conditions for the release on bail of Imran and Kamaluddin, as well as Manager Singh, in connection with the chargesheet originating from FIR No. 556/2019.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by Sharif Ahmed and Adil (SLP (Crl.) No. 1074/2017), Imran and Kamaluddin (SLP (Crl.) No. 5419/2022), and partly allowed the appeal of Manager Singh (SLP (Crl.) No. 9482/2021). The Court's orders include:

<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Section 14(3) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The provision specifies a period of three months for completing a preliminary assessment under Section 15 of the Act. The appellant has challenged this provision as mandatory.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant are:
- The provision of Section 14(3) is mandatory and cannot be extended beyond the stipulated three-month period.
- The interpretation of Section 7(4) of the Act, which deals with the procedure for passing orders under Section 15, is flawed.

The respondent's counterarguments are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that they may argue that the provision of Section 14(3) is directory rather than mandatory and can be extended.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
- The court observes that the period specified in Section 14(3) is not mandatory but directory, allowing for extensions based on written reasons.
- The court emphasizes the importance of properly recording the presence of parties and their counsel, as well as the purpose of adjournments, to ensure transparency and accountability in judicial proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is as follows:

(i) Section 14(3) of the Act is directory rather than mandatory. The period can be extended by the Chief Judicial Magistrate or the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate with written reasons.

(ii) The words "Children's Court" and "Court of Sessions" in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and its rules are to be read interchangeably. Primarily, jurisdiction vests in the Children's Court but can be exercised by the Court of Sessions if the former is not constituted.

(iii) An appeal against an order passed under Section 15 of the Act can be filed within 30 days from the date of the order. The appellate court can entertain appeals even after the expiry of this period, provided sufficient cause is shown and the appeal is decided within 30 days.

(iv) There is no error in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction by the High Court in the present matter.

(v) The order passed by the Board on 15.11.2023 dealing with the procedure as per Section 7(4) of the Act was correct.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a petition filed under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The petitioner seeks to challenge the jurisdiction of an arbitration tribunal on the grounds that the seat of arbitration is not India.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the petitioner include:
* The arbitration agreement does not designate India as the seat of arbitration.
* The parties have chosen a venue for the arbitration, but this does not necessarily imply that India is the seat of arbitration.
* The court should consider the intentions of the parties and give weight to their choices made in the arbitration agreement.

On the other hand, the respondent argues:
* The express designation of a place of arbitration anchors the arbitral proceedings to such place, and there being no other significant contrary indicia, such place would be the 'seat' of arbitration.
* Where the curial law of a particular place or supranational body of rules has been stipulated in an arbitration agreement or clause, such stipulation is a positive indicium that the place so designated is actually the 'seat'.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observes:
* The parties have made specific choices and stipulations in the arbitration agreement.
* The courts should give deference to these choices and not impute them as inadvertence or mistake on behalf of the parties.
* The Closest Connection Test may be more suitable for determining the seat of arbitration where there is no express or implied designation of a place of arbitration.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds:
* The present petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is not maintainable as neither the seat of arbitration is India nor is the arbitration agreement governed by laws of India.
* The parties shall bear their own costs.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the appellants against the respondent under the Factories Act, 1948. The respondent is registered as a factory under the ESI Act for the same premises. The issue at hand is whether the respondent's activities fall under the definition of a "factory" and if they are using a "manufacturing process" within the meaning of the Factories Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* The appellants argue that the respondent's activities, including washing and cleaning, fall under the definition of a "factory" and a "manufacturing process" within the meaning of the Factories Act.
* The respondents argue that their activities do not amount to a "manufacturing process" and therefore they are not liable under the Factories Act.
* The appellants also point out that the respondent is registered as a factory under the ESI Act for the same premises, which supports their contention that the respondent's activities fall under the definition of a "factory".
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:

* The definition of "manufacturing process" in Section 2(k) of the Factories Act includes any process for washing or cleaning.
* The respondent's activities, including washing and cleaning, fall within this definition.
* The fact that the respondent is registered as a factory under the ESI Act for the same premises supports the appellants' contention.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that:

* The respondent's activities do indeed amount to a "manufacturing process" within the meaning of the Factories Act.
* As such, the respondent is liable under the Factories Act and the complaint filed by the appellants is valid.
* The order issuing process dated 04.12.2019 stands restored to the file of the learned JMFC, Panaji, and shall be proceeded with in accordance with law.

The court also notes that it has refrained from remitting the complaint to the Magistrate to exercise his powers afresh, given the categorical findings rendered by the court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent, a high-calibre and quality employee, was subjected to unfair rating by the appellant company without any feedback or review. He made a complaint to the Ombudsman regarding his unfair rating. The respondent submitted his resignation letter stating that he felt humiliated and insulted due to the unfair treatment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court analyzed various points, including:
- Whether the respondent was entitled to be considered as a "workman" under the Industrial Disputes Act (ID Act) based on his duties and job description.
- The validity of the company's rating system and its impact on the respondent's employment.
- The concept of a "workman" under the ID Act, including whether it applies to high-calibre employees like the respondent.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- A person in employment cannot dictate terms to their employer; they have channels for venting grievances but ultimately, the view of competent authorities prevails.
- The phraseology "not of his free will" in the resignation letter did not necessarily mean it was forced upon him by the company; rather, it seemed more like a result of being unfairly rated.
- It would be far-fetched to assume that the entire organization turned against one individual without any direct allegations of bias or victimization.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The respondent was not a "workman" under the ID Act based on his duties and job description.
- Reference to the Labour Court under the ID Act against the appellant would not be maintainable in this case.
- The impugned judgment as well as the learned Single Judge's judgment were set aside, and the judgment of the Labour Court was revived and restored.

The court also stated that they commend the respondent for his spirited resistance to the appeal. The parties were ordered to bear their own costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquisition of a property by the appellant-Corporation under Section 352 of the Act. The Corporation passed an order of acquisition on 18.01.1991 directing to acquire the subject land under Section 352(a) of the Act with immediate effect and the possession should also be taken immediately. However, no compensation has been paid as yet. The Corporation continued to accept property tax payments from the recorded owner until 2010, when it deleted the owner's name and incorporated its own as the owner.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant-Corporation argued that they acquired the land under Section 352 of the Act, while the respondent-owner claimed that the acquisition was illegal. The Corporation contended that possession was taken in 1991, but the records show otherwise. The Corporation also explained the delay in altering the property tax records as a mistake due to lack of synchronization between departments.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the Corporation acted "blatantly in violation of the statutory provision" by acquiring the property under Section 352(a) instead of approaching the State under Section 537(1) of the Act. The Court noted that even if possession was taken in 1991, no compensation has been paid and the property tax records were not altered until 2010.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant-Corporation against the judgment of the High Court, upholding the decision to quash and set aside the acquisition order. The Court held that the Corporation's action was per se illegal and invalid. The judgment does not brook interference on any count.

Learned A.S.G. Sri K.M. Nataraj appeared for the Union of India and Union Territory of Puducherry.
Learned senior counsel and learned counsel appeared for the States of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana.
The petitioners sought to challenge various provisions of the respective Acts before the High Courts.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
A more effective manner of ventilating the grievances by the petitioners was to assail the provisions of the respective Acts before the respective jurisdictional High Courts.
The High Courts were free to constitute an Expert Committee for assistance in deciding the cases, if they so thought fit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Judges disposed of the writ petitions by reserving liberty to the petitioners to file their writ petitions before the respective High Courts.
If such writ petitions were filed by the petitioners before the respective High Courts, the same would be considered having regard to various dimensions of the provisions in light of socio-economic, cultural, and religious aspects of the matter.
The writ petitions were disposed of on April 01, 2025.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCT>
The case involves the appeals against the order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) regarding the resolution plan for the Corporate Debtor.
</ FUNCT>

<FACTS>
The Corporate Debtor's Resolution Plan was approved by NCLAT on February 14, 2019. Despite this, there has been no progress in implementing the plan. The Supreme Court notes that almost five years have elapsed since the approval of the plan. The lenders/creditors had infused Rs 200 Crore and the SRA had furnished a Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs. 150 Crore.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court argues that the NCLAT's order was perverse and unsustainable in law, leading to further complications. The Court suggests that the Parliament should look into the matter in consultation with the Insolvency Bankruptcy Board of India and the Ministry of Finance. The Court also emphasizes the need for filling vacancies in the Tribunals and addressing infrastructure needs.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observes that there is a shortage of members in the Tribunals, inadequate infrastructure, and operational inefficiencies. These issues have hindered the insolvency reform initiative undertaken by the government. The Court notes that the strict timelines provided in Section 12 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) are not being complied with.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court sets aside the impugned order passed by NCLAT and allows the appeals. The Court invokes its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution to direct that the Corporate Debtor be taken in liquidation. The NCLT, Mumbai is directed to take appropriate steps for appointment of a liquidator and other necessary formalities for commencement of liquidation. The amount of Rs 200 Crore infused by the SRA stands forfeited, and the lenders/creditors are permitted to encash the Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs. 150 Crore furnished by the SRA.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction of two appellants under Section 302 IPC for causing the death of a person. The appellants had been accused of committing murder, but the court found that there was no clear motive or premeditation behind the assault.
The deceased and the appellants were known to each other as they resided in the same locality. However, the sole eyewitness, Lata Bai (PW-10), could not provide a clear reason for why the quarrel occurred suddenly.
The court noted that although the injuries inflicted on the deceased were grievous and sufficient to cause death, the deceased did not succumb immediately and died on the third day after the incident.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The prosecution argued that the appellants had committed murder with intent to kill. However, the defense argued that there was no clear motive or premeditation behind the assault.
The court considered whether the act of causing death was done with the intention of causing death or causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observed that although the injuries inflicted on the deceased were grievous and sufficient to cause death, the cumulative effect of these head injuries led to the demise of the deceased.
The court noted that it had not been established clearly that the assault was preplanned or that there was prior enmity between the appellants and the deceased.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court converted the conviction of the appellants from Section 302 IPC (Murder) to Part I of Section 304 IPC (Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder).
The court sentenced the appellants to imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and also imposed a fine on them.
However, considering that the appellants had already undergone 10 years 3 months of incarceration during the trial and pendency of appeals, the court decided to sentence them only for the period already undergone by them.
A fine of Rs.50,000/- each was imposed on the appellants, which was to be paid to the family of the deceased through his mother, failing which they would undergo an additional 6 months simple imprisonment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a conviction of the appellant for various offenses, including the recovery of a trolley bag and an ID card from his sister's custody. The prosecution story relies on circumstantial evidence to link the appellant to the crimes. The key facts extracted include:
- The recovery of a trolley bag from PW-24.
- The recovery of an ID card from the appellant's sister's custody.
- The prosecution theory that the appellant retained the ID card for over 2 months after the incident.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the learned counsel for the appellant include:
- The infirmities in the prosecution story, including the lack of description of articles or their place of keeping.
- The unnatural retention of the ID card by the appellant.
- The unreliability of PW-5 as a witness who had acted as a Panch before and knew PW-38.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The lack of complete chain of circumstances linking the appellant to the crimes.
- The sketchy and disjointed nature of the evidence presented by the prosecution.
- The need for caution in cases based on circumstantial evidence, as reiterated in Reg vs. Hodge and Hanumant Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is:
- The conviction of the appellant is set aside due to insufficient evidence linking him to the crimes.
- The prosecution has failed to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt.
- The appellant is acquitted of the offenses for which he was charged and shall be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two appeals filed by a judicial officer against the dismissal of charges against him in two cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The cases were tried and concluded within a single day, with the accused being shown the court's proceedings without sufficient time for consultation or representation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The judicial officer argued that the decisions relied upon by his counsel have bearing on the present case, and that he is fortunate to have escaped action. He also sought intervention in an administrative decision taken against him.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the trial was conducted in utmost haste, with judgments being delivered within 30 minutes of the commencement of proceedings. The court noted that it would be humanly impossible to deliver such lengthy judgments within such a short time frame. The court also pointed out that the accused was not given sufficient opportunity for consultation or representation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeals and directed the trial court to keep in mind the mandate of the POCSO Act, 2012 while recording evidence. It also directed the completion of trials expeditiously in view of Section 35 of the Act. The Government of India was ordered to file an affidavit on the feasibility of introducing a comprehensive sentencing policy within six months. Additionally, the court allowed pending applications and dismissed IA No. 29814/2023.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the death of a woman and her 7-year-old daughter at the hands of the husband. The incident took place inside their home, where the family was residing. The husband had not informed his family members about the death and cremated the body clandestinely. He fled the scene, leaving behind his minor daughter. The husband had also been involved in a fight with the deceased two to three days prior to the incident. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the facts presented constitute more than a prima facie case, enabling them to invoke Section 106 of the Evidence Act and shift the burden on the accused husband to explain what had happened on the day of his wife's death. The defense was not explicitly mentioned in the judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the circumstances presented constitute a prima facie case, justifying the invocation of Section 106 of the Evidence Act. The court also noted that the rule of benefit of reasonable doubt does not imply a frail willow bending to every whiff of hesitancy and emphasized the importance of dealing with cases in a more realistic manner.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed, and the impugned judgment and order of acquittal passed by the High Court were set aside. The judgment and order of conviction passed by the Trial Court in S.T. No. 197 of 2003 were restored. The respondent accused was directed to surrender before the Trial Court within a period of four weeks from the date of the judgment to undergo the sentence imposed by the Trial Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal filed by the appellants, who were summoned as accused in a criminal trial. The summons was issued by the Trial Court on February 21, 2024, after the High Court had passed a revisional order on September 14, 2021.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the context and the decision of the court, it can be inferred that the appellants argued against being summoned as accused and sought an opportunity to be heard before facing trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the summoning order dated February 21, 2024, was passed by the Trial Court in pursuance of the directions issued by the High Court vide the revisional order dated September 14, 2021. The combined effect of the revisional order and the summoning order would be that the order of the Trial Court rejecting the second Section 319 application stood replaced and substituted by the summoning order.
The court also observed that a right of hearing would accrue only to a person who is already discharged in the very same proceeding prior to the commencement of the trial. However, after the rejection of an application under Section 319, a right enures in favour of the proposed accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that although the summoning order came to be passed on February 21, 2024, which is after the conclusion of the trial, it would be deemed to have been passed on July 19, 2010, by virtue of the law expounded by the Supreme Court in Maru Ram (supra) and Krishnaji Dattatreya Bapat (supra).
The court further held that if in exercise of revisional jurisdiction, the High Court is to pass an order which is prejudicial to the benefit which had already enured in favour of the proposed accused, then the High Court is obligated in law to provide an opportunity of hearing to the proposed accused.
The appeal was dismissed, and the Trial Court was directed to take necessary steps in furtherance of the summoning order dated February 21, 2024, to ensure that the appellants are produced before the court to face trial.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the judgment of a Division Bench of the High Court, which had interfered with a well-reasoned judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge of the High Court. The appeal is related to a compulsory acquisition of land for a public purpose and the payment of compensation in lieu of acquisition.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the Division Bench committed an egregious error in interfering with the well-reasoned judgment of the learned Single Judge, as there was no good reason for interference. The appellants relied on various precedents to support their argument, including Lachhman Dass v. Jagat Ram (2007) 10 SCC 448 and Vidya Devi v. State of H.P. (2020) 2 SCC 569.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the constitutional discourse on compulsory acquisitions has rooted itself within the "power of eminent domain" and that the twin conditions of acquisition for a public purpose and payment of compensation are necessary conditions for compulsory deprivation to afford protection to individuals who are being divested of property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed both appeals, set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court, and restored that of the learned Single Judge. The pending applications, if any, were disposed of accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the respondent (original plaintiff) and the appellant regarding the registration of a sale deed for a property. The respondent had entered into an agreement to sell the property on January 24, 2007, but the sale deed was not registered due to a ban imposed by the Government Order dated August 8, 1986. The High Court had earlier directed the registrar to register the sale deeds pertaining to the suit property, setting aside the ban.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that the bar under Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) did not apply to the facts of the case, as the cause of action for the second suit was distinct from that of the first suit. The respondent contended that the crucial fact which acted as a linchpin in saving the second suit was the High Court's own decisions dated March 5, 2008, and March 25, 2008, which set aside the ban imposed by the Government Order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had earlier held that the bar under Order II Rule 2 was not applicable, but for different reasons than those stated in the judgment. The court noted that the respondent would not be prevented from instituting the second suit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the High Court and held that the bar under Order II Rule 2 CPC would not stand in the way of the institution of the second suit by the respondent. The court observed that the crucial fact which acted as a linchpin in saving the second suit was the High Court's own decisions dated March 5, 2008, and March 25, 2008. The court further noted that the Trial Court was directed to decide both suits together on their merits.

* Schemes/programmes and seminars should be promoted to raise awareness regarding an ecosystem-based approach to water management, wetlands rehabilitation, riparian zone protection, and overall ecological health of water bodies.

The Court's judgment is as follows:
* The order passed by the High Court in WP Nos. 8335 of 2008 and 19017 of 2009 stands modified, and the appeals filed by the Vellore District Environment Monitoring Committee stand disposed of.
* The order passed by the High Court in WP No. 22683 of 2009, thereby confirming the award dated 24.08.2009 passed by the LoEA, is upheld, and the appeal filed by AISHTMA is dismissed.
* There is no order as to costs.
* Connected miscellaneous application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the classification was rational and had a nexus to the policy, while the respondent argued that the classification was arbitrary and violated Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
</ARGUMENTS>

The Court quashed GoM Nos. 243 and 244 dated 28.02.2005 to the extent they classified MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS/State Government, Judges of the Constitutional Courts, and journalists as a separate class for allotment of land at the basic rate.
The Court also declared GoM Nos. 419, 420, 422 to 425 dated 25.03.2008, and GoM No. 551 dated 27.03.2008, to be bad in law, being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, and were quashed by issuing a Writ of certiorari.
The Court directed that the Cooperative Societies and their members would be entitled to a refund of the entire amount deposited by them, including the stamp duty and the registration fee paid by them, along with the interest which may be quantified by the State of Telangana.

</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>

The appellant argued that the doctrine does not extend to contracts between private parties and that their relationship with the respondents is contractual.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that legitimate expectation is a device created to maintain a check on arbitrariness in state action, but it cannot govern contracts between private parties. The court also noted that even if the function of imparting education by a private institution may be considered as a public function, the relationship between the institution and its employees remains contractual.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment was set aside, and the appeals were allowed. Although the court set aside the impugned judgment, it did not terminate the respondents' employment with the appellant society. Instead, they were allowed to continue serving on the terms stipulated by the appellant society.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a group of appellants who were selected and appointed to various positions in 1998. However, their appointments were challenged by Respondent No.4 Archana Mishra before the Collector, Chhatarpur. The matter was subsequently taken up by the Division Bench of the High Court, which passed a judgment dismissing the appeal filed by the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that their appointments were valid and should not be set aside due to procedural irregularities. They also contended that they had functioned in office for more than 25 years and had even superannuated one of them, making it impractical to remand the matter for a fresh enquiry.
On the other hand, Respondent No.4 Archana Mishra argued that the appointments were made without following the proper procedures and that the Collector failed to give her an opportunity to implead the selected candidates before passing the order dismissing her appeal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court noted that while there was some procedural irregularity in the selection process, it did not affect the validity of the appointments. The Court also observed that the appellants had continued in office for a long period and that remanding the matter for a fresh enquiry would not be in the interest of justice.
Furthermore, the Court pointed out that Respondent No.4 Archana Mishra should have impleaded the selected candidates before the Collector, who failed to give her an opportunity to do so.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court. It held that the appointments of the appellants were valid and that they should be entitled to continue in service with all service benefits. The Court also directed that no order as to costs would be made.
Finally, the Court placed the matter before the Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Bench due to the divergent views expressed by the judges.

<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the final Select List dated 10.03.2023, which was prepared by the High Court of Gujarat for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service under the 65% quota on the basis of 'Merit-cum-Seniority'. The petitioners, who were senior judicial officers, claimed that they had been overlooked for promotion despite scoring higher marks in the suitability test.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the promotion process adopted by the High Court of Gujarat was contrary to the principle of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' as stipulated in Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules. They contended that the selection process should have been based on a departmental competitive examination, and that their seniority and higher marks in the suitability test entitled them to promotion.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the four components of the Suitability Test prescribed under the recruitment notice dated 12.04.2022 comprehensively evaluated (i) the legal knowledge including knowledge of case law through the objective MCQ-based written test AND (ii) the continued efficiency by evaluation of the ACRs, average disposal and past judgments of the concerned judicial officer.
The court also noted that the promotion process adopted by the High Court of Gujarat since 2011 was in line with the twin requirements stipulated in paragraph 27 of All India Judges' Association (3) (supra), which included objective assessment of legal knowledge and evaluation of continued efficiency.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the final Select List dated 10.03.2023 was not contrary to the principle of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' as stipulated in Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules. The court clarified that for the 65% promotional quota, it is for a particular High Court to prescribe or lay down its own minimum standard to judge the suitability of a judicial officer, including the requirement of comparative assessment, if necessary.
The court also held that the promotion process adopted by the High Court of Gujarat was not liable to be set aside, and that the petitioners' contention would completely flip the process and displace the respondents once again for a contrary reason.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute regarding the chargeable distance between Refinery Baad and Hisar. The Railway Claims Tribunal had initially allowed a claim for Rs. 2,19,61,000 as freight charges based on a chargeable distance of 444 km. However, later reworked the chargeable distance to 333.18 km. The Appellant railway challenged this decision in the High Court, which upheld the TLT's order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the change in methodology would have resulted in a huge difference of 110 km in the chargeable distance, and since there was no change in the route or physical track length, the change in methodology could not have resulted in such a large difference. They also pointed out that the letter dated 05.07.2005 indicates that the change in the chargeable distance of 444 km was due to an error.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Railway Claims Tribunal observed that the payment made for 444 km was excessive and should have been only for 333.18 km. The High Court also noted that the Appellant railway had granted a refund without explaining the reason, despite their stance that the respondent is not entitled to any refund.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal and dismissed the appeals filed by the Appellant railway. The Court concluded that the change in methodology would at best have resulted in a difference of 1 km for each intervening station, which would not have caused a difference of 110 km. The Court also relied on the concurrent findings of both the Railway Claims Tribunal and the High Court that the actual distance was 333.18 km.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the respondent's failure to make the balance payment for a secured asset after winning an e-auction conducted by the appellant bank. The demonetization that occurred before the e-auction and the delay in raising necessary finance due to the same are cited as reasons for the non-payment. However, it is also mentioned that the sale was confirmed on 07.12.2016, and the respondent requested for documents only on 20.12.2016, which were provided within a month's time. The respondent was granted an extension of 90-days' time period to make the balance payment but failed to do so.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the respondent include:
- The demonetization that occurred before the e-auction as a reason for not making the balance payment.
- Delay in raising necessary finance due to the demonetization.
- The appellant bank's failure to provide certain documents on time, which led to the respondent being unable to secure a term loan.

The arguments presented by the court include:
- The respondent was aware of his financial capacity and willingly participated in the e-auction, knowing the reserve price of the secured asset and the consequences of not paying the balance amount.
- The demonetization occurred before the e-auction, making it an extraneous condition.
- The appellant bank provided documents within a month's time after the respondent requested them.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- Extraneous conditions exist that might have led to the inability of the successful auction purchaser despite best efforts from depositing the balance amount to no fault of its own, in such cases the earnest-money deposited by such innocent successful auction purchaser could certainly be asked to be refunded.
- The respondent's case does not fall under exceptional circumstances warranting judicial interference.
- The e-auction notice and correspondence between the appellant bank and the respondent clearly spelt out the consequences of not paying the balance amount within the specified period.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The High Court committed an egregious error in passing the impugned judgment and order.
- The appeals filed by the bank succeed and are hereby allowed.
- The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court dated 27.10.2021 is hereby set aside.
- As a result, the SA No. 143 of 2018 filed by the respondent before the DRT-II also stands dismissed.
- The parties shall bear their own costs.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over a suit property, where the appellant (a company) has set up an oxygen cylinder manufacturing plant. The respondent (ARCIL) had attached the property due to some loan liabilities of the appellant. The High Court ordered that the possession of the property be taken over by the competent authorities if the appellant fails to deposit Rs. 4,00,00,000/- with ARCIL.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant's main argument is that it has invested heavily in setting up the plant and has been running it for 15 years, employing approximately 200 people. The respondent's (ARCIL) main argument would likely revolve around the loan liabilities of the appellant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the High Court committed no error in its judgment, but due to the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, the court deemed it necessary to give one opportunity to the appellant to save its industrial unit. The court also noted that if the possession of the property is taken over, the plant will have to be dismantled unless a new buyer takes over the entire plant with the land.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court states that both appeals are allowed in part. While affirming the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, the court directed the appellant to deposit a sum of Rs. 4,00,00,000/- with ARCIL within six months from today. If the appellant fails to do so, the competent authorities will take over the possession of the entire unit with the land in question and put it up for fresh auction process. Additionally, if the appellant deposits the required amount within the stipulated period, the contempt proceedings pending before the High Court shall stand terminated.

<Facts>
The case revolves around a tender that was issued in favor of the appellant, which was later canceled by the respondent at the behest of the concerned Minister-In-Charge. The appellant had erected multiple structures for displaying advertisements on underpasses and made significant investments pursuant to the tender.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the respondent's cancellation of the tender was challenged by the appellant, who argued that the notice of cancellation was illegal and arbitrary.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
- The respondent's exercise of power in canceling the tender is considered arbitrary by the court.
- The court emphasizes the importance of transparency and fairness in public procurement processes.
- Participating in tenders should not be viewed as a situation worse than losing at the threshold, as it may discourage public participation in such processes.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allows the appeal, quashing the notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 and setting aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court.

The Khalsa University was established in 2016, and the appellants were trying to affiliate their institutions with it. The appellants gave a specific undertaking that the majestic façade and visual appeal of the building of the Khalsa College has not been touched or adversely affected by the establishment of the Khalsa University. They also stated that they would not be affiliating the Khalsa College with the Khalsa University.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the Khalsa University was established to affiliate their institutions, and it did so without harming the Khalsa College. They also pointed out that the Khalsa University has been established by converting pre-existing colleges into departments within the university.

However, the court countered this argument by stating that the purpose for which the Khalsa University was enacted is non-existent. The court observed that the appellants' undertaking and statement during the hearing contradicted their initial stand of affiliating the Khalsa College with the Khalsa University.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Impugned Act, which was enacted to affiliate the Khalsa College with the Khalsa University, falls under the ambit of manifest arbitrariness and is therefore violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The court also noted that the Khalsa College, established in 1892, is a heritage institution and is not part of the Khalsa University.

The detenu, Appisseril Kochu Mohammed Shaji (Shaji A.K.), was detained on August 31, 2023, and the order of detention was confirmed by the Under Secretary, Government of India, on November 28, 2023. The detenu's representation against the detention order was not decided for about 9 months.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:
* The detention order is liable to be quashed and set aside due to the delay in deciding the representation of the detenu.
* The Prison Authorities were negligent in ensuring that the representation of the detenu was communicated at the earliest.
* The representation should have been sent through email or Speed Post (acknowledgment due) to ensure timely communication.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are:
* Each day's delay matters in cases related to personal liberty of citizens.
* The Prison Authorities' casual, callous, and negligent approach led to a significant delay in deciding the representation of the detenu.
* The valuable right guaranteed to the detenu under Article 22(5) of the Constitution was denied due to the delay.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court is:
* The appeal is allowed, and the judgment and order of the High Court dated March 4, 2024, are quashed and set aside.
* The detention order dated August 31, 2023, and the confirmation order dated November 28, 2023, are quashed and set aside.
* The detenu is directed to be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a custodial death, where a person named Shama @ Kalya allegedly died in police custody. The appellants are the police officers involved in the incident.
Deepak Lokhande (PW-8) allegedly impersonated Shama on 24.12.1995 and staged a performance to support the police version that Shama had escaped from their custody on that night.
The Railway Court at Raipur had convicted Shama for an unrelated offense, which was used as evidence by the police to support their claim of Shama's escape.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellants were responsible for Shama's custodial death and that they had attempted to cover up the incident by staging a fake performance with Deepak Lokhande.
The defense argued that there was insufficient evidence to prove the appellants' involvement in Shama's death and that the prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that custodial deaths are a serious issue in India and that the police often resort to third-degree methods to extract confessions from suspects.
The court noted that the appellants had been convicted under Section 304 Part-II IPC, which is a lesser offense than what was expected given the circumstances of the case.
The court also observed that the prosecution's failure to prove the homicidal death of Shama @ Kalya did not necessarily mean that the appellants were entitled to acquittal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judge maintained the convictions and sentences of the appellants, as confirmed by the High Court, and dismissed all the appeals. The judge noted that giving in to the duplicitous stories of the appellants would only add insult to injury and that they had been let off lightly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The award debtor deposited an amount of Rs. 7.5 crores on October 22, 2010, which was not withdrawn by the respondent. A second deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs was made pursuant to a High Court order dated June 3, 2011, but this could only be withdrawn in 2016.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The relevant date for determining the conversion rate of foreign awards expressed in foreign currency is the date when the award becomes enforceable, as per the Act and the principle in Forasol (supra).
* When the award debtor deposits an amount before the court during the pendency of objections, the deposited amount must be converted as on the date of the deposit.
* The statutory scheme of the Act makes a foreign arbitral award enforceable when the objections against it are finally decided.

The respondent's argument that Forasol (supra) does not apply under the 1996 Act was also presented.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Some key observations from the case include:

* The non-withdrawal of Rs. 7.5 crores by the respondent on October 22, 2010, was in its own discretion and inaction.
* The order of June 3, 2011, permits withdrawal of Rs. 50 lakhs only on the completion of proceedings, which were completed on July 1, 2014.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:

* The statutory scheme of the Act makes a foreign arbitral award enforceable when the objections against it are finally decided.
* The relevant date for determining the conversion rate of foreign awards expressed in foreign currency is the date when the award becomes enforceable, as per the Act and the principle in Forasol (supra).
* When the award debtor deposits an amount before the court during the pendency of objections, the deposited amount must be converted as on the date of the deposit.
* The first deposit of Rs. 7.5 crores must be converted as on October 22, 2010, while the second deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs and the remaining amount due under the award must be converted when the objections proceedings attained finality on July 1, 2014.

The judgment partly allows the appeal and sets aside the findings of the High Court in the impugned judgment to the extent that Forasol (supra) does not apply under the 1996 Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a corporate guarantor (ACIL) and its principal borrower (2nd respondent-corporate debtor). The financial creditor (1st respondent-financial creditor) received Rs.38.87 crores from the resolution applicant (appellant) under the resolution plan of ACIL. The issue at hand is whether this payment extinguishes the liability of the 2nd respondent-principal borrower/corporate debtor to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments made by the appellant based on Section 140 of the Contract Act were considered, but it was found that the subrogation would only confer the right to recover Rs.38.87 crores from the corporate debtor, and not extinguish the balance debt payable by the corporate debtor.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that a holding company is not the owner of the assets of its subsidiary, so the assets of the subsidiaries cannot be included in the resolution plan of the holding company. The financial creditor can file separate applications under Section 7 of the IBC against the corporate debtor and the corporate guarantor.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeal, upholding the view taken by NCLAT that the payment of Rs.38.87 crores does not extinguish the liability of the 2nd respondent-principal borrower/corporate debtor to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the selection of certain individuals for a position, with one side alleging bias and the other side contesting it. The appellants have continuously held office for over 25 years under interim orders, and one of them has already superannuated.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments include:

*   The principle of audi alteram partem is essential in ensuring that no person is condemned unheard, safeguarding against arbitrary decision-making, especially in cases with unequal power dynamics.
*   An allegation of bias can only be proved after giving an opportunity for a hearing, requiring a fair and transparent procedure where concerned parties are given adequate time to present their case.
*   A defect at the initial stage cannot generally be cured at the appellate stage, even if 'full jurisdiction' is available, and the courts must have the discretion to relegate it to the original stage for an opportunity of hearing.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
Key observations include:

*   The importance of natural justice in assisting administrative authorities in reaching sound decisions at the outset, reducing the likelihood of decisions being overturned later.
*   The significance of fostering fair and well-informed decision-making at the initial instance.
*   Providing a hearing to affected individuals minimizes the risk of administrative authorities making decisions in ignorance of facts or other relevant circumstances.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment upholds the opinion of Justice KV Vishwanathan, allowing the appeal(s) and setting aside the judgment of the Division Bench. The court concludes that remanding the matter for a fresh inquiry would be an injustice to the appointees, given the significant time lag since the selection in 1998 and the fact that one of the appellants has already superannuated. Parties are ordered to bear their own costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a writ petition regarding the role of the Governor in legislative processes. The petitioner is concerned about the Governor's withholding assent to certain legislation, which they believe is contrary to the Constitution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioner and the respondent are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the petitioner is arguing for a stronger role of the Governor in legislative processes, while the respondent may be arguing for a more limited role.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations regarding the role of constitutional functionaries and their duty to uphold the Constitution are made by the court. The court notes that the soul of India is its Constitution and emphasizes the importance of upholding it.
The court also references a historical example from the early days of the Indian Republic, where the first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, accepted the opinion of the Attorney General regarding the role of the President under the Indian Constitution.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, who was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with a case. The CBI registered an FIR against him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Arvind Kejriwal filed two Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) before the Supreme Court challenging his arrest.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioner, Arvind Kejriwal, were that his arrest was illegal and unconstitutional. He argued that the CBI had no jurisdiction to investigate him in connection with the case and that the FIR registered against him was also invalid. The petitioner relied on various judgments of the Supreme Court which held that a Chief Minister cannot be arrested by the police without the prior permission of the Central Government.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Bench of two judges observed that despite having serious reservations regarding certain conditions imposed by a coordinate bench in another case, it would not express its views at this stage. The Bench also noted that there was a concurrent opinion among the judges that the petitioner was entitled to be released on bail subject to certain terms and conditions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed by Arvind Kejriwal and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court. The Court directed that the petitioner be released on bail in connection with FIR No. RC0032022A0053/2022 registered by the CBI at PS CBI, ACB, upon furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/- with two sureties of such like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the contempt of court proceedings against several respondents, including police officials and a judicial magistrate. The order in question was passed by this Court on 8th December, 2023, directing the release of the petitioners on bail in the event of arrest. However, despite this direction, the petitioners were granted police custody remand, which led to their illegal detention for almost 48 hours.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the respondents include:

*   The explanation offered by ACJM (contemnor-respondent No.7) that she acted with a genuine misunderstanding of the legal position and was exercising her jurisdiction in good faith.
*   The plea that the order passed by this Court on 8th December, 2023 allowed for multiple interpretations regarding the release of the petitioners on bail.

However, the Court rejected these arguments, holding that the respondents' actions were in contempt of the court's order and that they had failed to release the petitioners as directed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations are made by the Court:

*   The respondents' failure to release the petitioners on bail despite the direction of this Court was a clear contempt of the court's order.
*   The illegal detention of the petitioners for almost 48 hours after the period of police remand had come to an end was a result of the respondents' contumacious actions.

The Court holds that the respondents' actions were in direct contravention of the court's order and that they must be held accountable for their contempt.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court holds R.Y. Raval, Police Inspector, Vesu Police Station, Surat (contemnor-respondent No.4) and Deepaben Sanjaykumar Thakar, 6th Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Surat (contemnor-respondent No.7) guilty of having committed contempt of this Court's order dated 8th December, 2023.

The orders dated 8th December, 2023, 11th January, 2024, and 23rd January, 2024 passed by this Court in SLP Nos. 14489 of 2023, 537 of 2024, and 1116 of 2024, respectively are made absolute.

It is directed that the ad-interim anticipatory bail granted to the petitioners shall enure till culmination of the proceedings from the FIR No. 11210068230266 of 2023 dated 21st July, 2023.

The special leave petitions are accordingly disposed of, and pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The complainant filed a complaint of cheating and criminal breach of trust against the appellants. The court examined the contents of the complaint to determine whether the offence of cheating or criminal breach of trust was made out from the averments. It was found that the allegations did not genuinely constitute these specific offences. 
The police officers had registered an FIR for both the offences i.e. criminal breach of trust and cheating on a mere allegation of some dishonesty or fraud, without any proper application of mind.
The complainant had not filed any civil suit for recovery of the amount which according to him is due and payable to him by the appellants. He seems to have prima facie lost the period of limitation for filing such a civil suit.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the complaint did not disclose any offence under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). They contended that the allegations made in the complaint did not constitute an offence of cheating or criminal breach of trust. 
The court examined the contents of the complaint and found that the allegations did not genuinely constitute these specific offences.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It appears that the courts below had not been able to understand the fine distinction between criminal breach of trust and cheating. 
The police officers across the country need to be imparted proper training in law so as to understand the fine distinction between the offence of cheating viz-a-viz criminal breach of trust.
Both offences are independent and distinct, and they cannot coexist simultaneously in the same set of facts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the orders passed by the High Court and the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate. 
The court directed the Registry to send one copy each of this judgment to the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Law & Justice, Union of India and also to the Principal Secretary, Home Department, Union of India.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a clarification issued by the learned Arbitrator under Section 33(1) of the 1996 Act. The parties had agreed to a contract, and the respondent sought clarification from the Arbitrator beyond the initial period of 30 days. The court permitted the respondent to seek clarification, and both parties participated in the clarificatory proceeding.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the learned Arbitrator had become functus officio and therefore lacked jurisdiction to issue the clarification. However, the respondent contended that the expression "unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties" in Section 33(1) of the 1996 Act covers the present case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The court observed that the matter had attained finality up to the Apex Court and could not be interfered with on merits at this stage. The Division Bench of the High Court set aside the operative part of the order pertaining only to calculations, permitting both parties to make submissions restricted to the quantum of the amount payable to the respondent.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the clarification sought for and issued by the learned Arbitrator would be covered by the expression "unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties" in Section 33(1) of the 1996 Act. The court rejected the contention of the appellant that the learned Arbitrator had become functus officio and therefore lacked jurisdiction to issue the clarification.
The court also observed that it is not open to the appellant to raise the aforesaid issue again in the present proceeding, as it was raised earlier in a miscellaneous application filed by the appellant before this Court seeking clarification of the order dated 12.03.2015.
The judgment concluded that there shall be no order as to costs and dismissed the appeal.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the appointment of a respondent in a government job. The respondent had appeared before the High Court and was granted permission to appear for the interview, but was not appointed due to a discrepancy in his age mentioned in his application form. The respondent challenged this decision, citing that he had provided correct information about his age at the time of applying. He also contended that the government's decision to reject him solely based on this issue was arbitrary and unfair.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court relied on a previous case (Canara Bank v. Ashok Kumar) which held that a candidate's appointment cannot be rejected solely due to an error in his age mentioned in the application form, as long as he can prove that the information was correct at the time of applying. The respondent argued that this principle should apply in his case as well.
However, the government countered by arguing that the High Court had overlooked a critical aspect - the issue of suitability for the job. They contended that even if the respondent's age is not a bar to appointment, he must still demonstrate suitability for the position, which he failed to do in the interview.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed that the High Court had been bound by the previous case (Canara Bank v. Ashok Kumar) and did not have the opportunity to examine the issue of suitability. However, this oversight led to an order being passed that was more adverse than the one on the writ petition.
The coordinate bench seized of this appeal took a different view and considered making a direction for payment of a lumpsum amount to the respondent towards full and final settlement.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench as well as that of the Single Bench. The Court held that despite disagreeing with Canara Bank (supra), judicial propriety demanded that they refer the matter to a larger bench.
However, considering the circumstances, including the fact that one coordinate bench had already considered making a direction for payment of a lumpsum amount to the respondent and that there was no clear resolution in sight, the Court decided to invoke its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. The appellant was directed to make a lumpsum payment of Rs.2.5 lakh to the respondent within a period of two months from the date.
The civil appeal was allowed on the aforesaid terms, and no costs were ordered.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the acquisition of land for a welfare housing scheme in Nangli Kota, Delhi. The respondents were the owners of the land who contested the acquisition process before the High Court.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (Government of Himachal Pradesh) argued that they had followed all due procedures for acquiring the land and that the delay in payment of compensation was not their responsibility. They contended that the respondents were required to make representations for payment of compensation.

On the other hand, the respondents argued that the acquisition process was unfair and in contravention of the provisions of the RUI Act. They contended that the Government had taken possession of the land before depositing the compensation amount as mandated by law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the Government had failed to follow proper procedures for acquiring the land, including the requirement to deposit compensation with the Registrar General of Delhi.

The court also noted that the delay in payment of compensation was a contravention of Article 300-A of the Constitution and the principles of a welfare state. The court observed that the acquisition process was not fair and in accordance with law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court held that the notification under Section 52(1) was liable to be declared invalid on the ground that the compensation was not deposited and paid to the respondents within the timeline specified in Section 60A(4), as well as on the ground that the acquisition process was not fair and in accordance with law.

The court dismissed the appeals of the appellants, holding that no error had been committed by the High Court in passing the impugned order. The parties were directed to bear their own costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a land reservation under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1964. The plot in question was reserved for a public garden in a Development Plan in the year 1966 but was not acquired even after purchase notice was served by the landowner. The High Court had passed an order directing the acquisition of the land and payment of compensation to the landowners.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (landowners) argued that the reservation could be said to have lapsed under Section 127 of the MRTP Act due to non-acquisition of the land within the prescribed period. The respondents (authorities) did not take any steps to issue notification after receipt of the notice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that when by operation of law the reservation is deemed to have lapsed under Section 127(1) of the MRTP Act, the reservation lapses for all purposes and for all times to come. On the deemed lapse of such reservation, no writ of mandamus can be issued by the High Court to direct acquisition of that land and pay compensation to the landowners.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals and set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court. It was declared that the reservation of the plot in question could be said to have lapsed by efflux of time in view of the provisions under Sections 126 and 127 of the MRTP Act respectively.

<Facts>
The case involves a Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) who was expelled from the House for misconduct. The MLC challenged the expulsion in court, arguing that it was disproportionate and excessive. The court heard arguments from both parties and delivered its verdict.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments raised by the Petitioner:
- The punishment of expulsion was excessively severe and disproportionate to the nature of the misconduct committed by the MLC.
- The Constitutional Courts have the power to review the validity of actions taken by the House, including the proportionality of punishments.

Arguments raised by the Respondents:
- The Writ Petition is not maintainable as it falls within the restrictions outlined under Article 212 (1) of the Constitution of India.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court:
- The Court noted that there is no absolute bar on Constitutional Courts examining the proportionality of punishments imposed on Members while reviewing the validity of actions taken by the House.
- The period of expulsion already undergone by the MLC shall be deemed as a period of suspension from the House and will amount to sufficient punishment for his misdemeanour.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court delivered its verdict:
- Rejected the objection raised by the Respondents against the maintainability of the Writ Petition.
- Set aside the Impugned Report of the Ethics Committee as well as the Notification of the BLC, only to the extent of the nature of punishment it recommends to be imposed on the MLC.
- Directed the MLC to be reinstated as a member of the BLC with immediate effect, subject to certain conditions.
- Quashed the Press Note dated 30.12.2024 issued by Respondent No. 6, Election Commission, declaring the bye-election for the seat earlier held by the MLC.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of provisions in a law related to the applicability of precedents. The court is considering whether certain judgments are binding or not, specifically those related to Silpi Industries (supra) and Mahakali Foods (supra). The appeal was initially decided by two judges but was later referred to a three-judge Bench.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are centered around the interpretation of precedents. The court discusses the importance of clarity and certainty about applicable precedents on the subject matter. The appellants' counsel argued that certain judgments were not binding precedents, whereas the respondents' counsel contended that they were.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include the distinction between decision-making and precedent-making. The court notes that every judgment or order is not intended to be a binding precedent under Article 141. The court also highlights the difficulty faced by High Courts and subordinate courts in determining whether a particular judgment is for decision-making or precedent-making.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court states that, despite the possibility of following precedents, it deems necessary to refer this appeal to a three-judge Bench due to the compelling need for clarity and certainty about applicable precedents on the subject. The Registry is directed to place the appeal paperbooks along with the detailed judgment before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench.

<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal appeal regarding the release of a vehicle that was seized during an investigation under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The owner of the vehicle had not participated in the offense and had no knowledge of the alleged transaction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the appellant's counsel sought to rely on previous judgments of the Supreme Court, including Sainaba vs. State of Kerala and Another, which held that a vehicle seized during an investigation under the NDPS Act could be released on terms and conditions determined by the Special Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The keeping of the vehicle in police custody till the trial is over would serve no purpose and would result in its depreciation due to exposure to the elements.
* If the vehicle is released, it would be beneficial to the owner, the bank/financier, and society at large as an additional vehicle would be available for transportation of goods.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
* The present Criminal Appeal is allowed with directions to the trial Court to release the Vehicle in question in the interim on superdari after preparing a video and still photographs of the vehicle and after obtaining all information/documents necessary for identification of the vehicle, which shall be authenticated by the Investigating Officer, owner of the Vehicle and accused by signing the same.
* The appellant shall not sell or part with the ownership of the Vehicle till conclusion of the trial and shall furnish an undertaking to the trial court that he shall surrender the Vehicle within one week of being so directed and/or pay the value of the Vehicle (determined according to Income Tax law on the date of its release), if so ultimately directed by the Court.

The AAI had submitted a report to the Ministry recommending the takeover of 50 airports by private companies. However, the Ministry disagreed with the recommendation and decided not to take any action on it.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

*   The AAI argued that the Ministry had no authority to reject its report and that it was entitled to make recommendations on airport privatization.
*   The Ministry contended that it had the discretion to consider or reject any report submitted by the AAI, and that it had valid reasons for not taking action on the recommendation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the dispute between the parties was a matter of interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations. The court observed that the Ministry's decision to reject the AAI's report was lawful and within its powers.

The case revolves around the issue of drug abuse and trafficking in India. The facts mentioned include the cultural push towards a dangerous lifestyle, where consumption of drugs is glorified as 'cool' and fashionable. It is also stated that vulnerable children turn to drugs as an escapism from emotional distress and academic pressures or due to peer pressure.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are not clear, but it can be inferred that the main argument is against drug abuse and trafficking. The importance of creating awareness about the risks of drug abuse, particularly among schools and youth centers, is emphasized. It also highlights the need for cooperation between local communities, NGOs, law enforcement agencies, and government programs to prevent drug abuse.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations are not clearly stated in this case. However, it can be inferred that the observations may include the alarming rate of drug abuse among youth and its consequences on society and individuals.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment emphasizes the need for constructive citizenship to contribute positively to the nation's development. It also highlights the negative aspect of constructive citizenship, which is to actively refrain from contributing against the interest of the community and the nation.

The case involves an appeal against the judgment of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dated 2 August 2024. The appellant had entered into a settlement agreement with its financial creditors, which was challenged by the respondent. The dispute revolves around the approval of the settlement agreement by the CoC and the compliance with Regulation 30A of the CIRP Regulations.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant argued in favor of the approval of the settlement agreement, while the respondent raised objections to its approval.

The court also discusses the legal framework governing the withdrawal of CIRP and the applicability of Regulation 30A.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the decision of this Court in Abhishek Kumar (supra) is distinguishable from the present factual situation. The court also notes that there was no application filed through the IRP before the NCLT under Regulation 30A at all.

The court further observes that it would not be appropriate for this Court to adjudicate on the objections of the appellant to the settlement agreement on merits, as the issues raised are the subject matter of several litigations in different fora.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the present appeal and sets aside the impugned judgment of the NCLAT dated 2 August 2024. The amount of Rs 158 crore, along with accrued interest, if any, which has been maintained in a separate escrow account is to be deposited with the CoC. The CoC is directed to maintain this amount in an escrow account until further developments and to abide by the further directions of the NCLT.

The civil appeal and special leave petition stand disposed of accordingly.

* The prosecution argued that the cheque was issued by the accused to the complainant for an amount of Rs 7,00,000/-, which was dishonored due to insufficiency of funds. They also submitted evidence of the statutory notice issued to the accused and his failure to respond.
* The defense argued that the cheque was drawn on an account maintained by a company (Shilabati Hospital Pvt. Ltd.) in which the accused was a director, and therefore he was not personally liable for the dishonor of the cheque.

However, it is mentioned that the time period prescribed for issuance of statutory notice under Section 138 has long expired, making it difficult for the complainant to initiate proceedings against the hospital.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case are:

* The court notes that while the accused may not be liable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, there is evidence of his dishonest intention in not repaying the amount borrowed from the complainant.
* The court also observes that the complainant's civil action against the accused or the hospital would be time-barred and therefore would not provide relief to the complainant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is:

* The appeal fails, and it is hereby dismissed.
* The possibility of the accused having committed an offence of cheating cannot be ruled out. Prima facie, the mens rea (guilty mind) of the accused speaks for itself.
* It is left open to the complainant to approach the jurisdictional police station and lodge an appropriate FIR against the accused.

The pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The petition was filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed by the statute.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that there was no error or illegality on part of the High Court in dismissing the petition as barred by limitation. 
The court observed that the condonable period of 30 days stipulated under the proviso to Section 34(3) of the A & C Act had expired, and the delay could not have been condoned.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that practically all new/recent enactments are deviating from the prescribed period of limitation as per the Schedule of the Limitation Act. 
The statutes further provide that the delay beyond a certain period cannot be condoned by the court, which is in deviation to what is prescribed by Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* The lower courts failed to properly deal with the appellant's plea of juvenility, which resulted in him being sentenced beyond the upper limit prescribed under the relevant Act.
* The Executive cannot be construed to have undertaken an adjudication on the determination of the age of the accused.
* The High Court committed an error in its reasoning by not considering the distinct prayer invoking Section 9(2) of the 2015 Act.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a land acquisition proceeding for a project by the State and KIADB. The appellants, who are the original landowners, claim that their constitutional right under Article 300-A was violated due to inordinate delay in paying compensation. They filed a writ petition before the High Court, which was later allowed. However, the Division Bench of the High Court set aside this order and passed its own judgment. The appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' main argument is that their constitutional right under Article 300-A was violated due to inordinate delay in paying compensation. They contend that if the land acquisition proceedings are quashed, the only recourse available to the State/KIADB will be to issue a fresh acquisition notification, which would entail huge expenditure to the public exchequer.
The respondents (Respondent Nos.6 and 7) argue that they cannot be imposed with a liability for this huge additional expenditure, as the delay in determination of compensation and payment is not attributable to them but is on account of inaction on the part of the State and KIADB.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that if the land acquisition proceedings are quashed, it would result in a huge financial burden on the public exchequer. The court also notes that Respondent Nos.6 and 7 will be at liberty to take recourse to such remedies as are available to them in law for redressal of their inter se dispute.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court, exercising its power under Article 142 of the Constitution, quashes the judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court dated 22nd November 2022. The court allows the writ petition filed by the appellants before the High Court being W.P. No. 1627 of 2021.
The SLAO is directed to pass a fresh award taking the market value prevailing as on 22nd April 2019 within a period of two months from today after hearing the parties. The appellants shall be entitled to all statutory benefits as are available to them in law. The rights of parties to challenge the award in reference, if they are aggrieved by it, shall remain open.

The case revolves around a civil appeal regarding the Mega Power Status granted to a project under the Mega Power Policy by the Ministry of Power. The respondent claimed benefits from 30.07.2010, while the appellant argued that the new legal regime commenced with effect from 01.10.2009.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

*   The respondent's claim for benefits from 30.07.2010 was supported by the Ministry of Power granting Mega Power Status on this date.
*   The appellant argued that the press release of 01.10.2009 and subsequent notifications issued by the concerned Ministries of the Government of India on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009 marked the commencement of a new legal regime.
*   Several judgments were cited, including Bachhittar Singh vs. The State of Punjab, to contend that the press release of 01.10.2009 was not an "order".
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:

*   The court noted that the Ministry of Power granted Mega Power Status on 30.07.2010, and benefits would be applicable only from this date.
*   The court observed that the decision for granting Mega Power Status was taken/announced on 01.10.2009, but the notifications were issued later.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a complaint filed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The complainants, Awaz and others, challenged the charging of interest rates by banks on credit cards. They claimed that the rates were usurious and constituted an unfair trade practice.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) argued that the rate of interest charged by banks was determined by financial wisdom and directives issued by RBI, which were duly communicated to the credit card holders. The RBI contended that there existed no material on record to establish that any bank had acted contrary to policy directives.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) observed that it was necessary to examine whether the charging of interest rates constituted an unfair trade practice. However, upon examination, it was found that the pre-conditions for deceptive practices and unfair methods were absent.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by RBI and set aside the final judgment/order dated 07.07.2008 passed by the NCDRC. The court held that there was no question of directing RBI to act against any bank or imposing a cap on the rate of interest, contrary to provisions contained in the Banking Regulation Act.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an FIR (First Information Report) No. 11202008250014 of 2025, registered with City A-Division Police Station, Jamnagar.
A poem was allegedly recited, which led to the registration of the FIR under various sections of the IPC (Indian Penal Code).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are based on the importance of freedom of expression and the right to speech as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.
It is argued that mere recitation of a poem or any form of art or entertainment cannot be alleged to lead to animosity or hatred amongst different communities.
The prosecution's actions were deemed an abuse of process, and the High Court was justified in exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or under Section 482 of the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code) equivalent to Section 528 of the BNSS (Bombay Nyaya Shikshamani Sangh).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The importance of freedom of expression in a healthy civilised society.
- The need for the courts to uphold and enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
- The obligation of judges to uphold the Constitution and respect its ideals, even if they may not like spoken or written words.
- The potential stifling of legitimate expressions of view in the public domain if mere recital of a poem is alleged to lead to animosity or hatred amongst different communities.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states:
- The impugned order deserves to be set aside.
- FIR No. 11202008250014 of 2025, registered with City A-Division Police Station, Jamnagar, and further proceedings based thereon are quashed and set aside.
- The Appeal is accordingly allowed.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the DND Flyway Limited (NTBCL) and its Concession Agreement with State authorities and NOIDA. NTBCL had been collecting user fees/tolls from users of the DND flyover, which was challenged by Respondent No. 1, a welfare association.
The issue also involves outdoor advertising displayed on the flyover, for which NOIDA claims NTBCL owes substantial dues.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:

* The contract awarded to NTBCL through the Concession Agreement by State authorities and NOIDA was unfair, unjust and inconsistent with Constitutional norms.
* The delegation of power to levy fees or impose tolls to NTBCL by NOIDA is invalid.
* Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, read with the formula in Annexure F, contravenes public policy and should be severed from the Agreement.
* NTBCL has recovered the project costs and substantial profits, eliminating any justification for the continued imposition or collection of user fees or tolls.

The arguments are presented by Respondent No. 1's writ petition filed in public interest, which was maintainable as per the High Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It is observed that:

* The role played by IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services) in the entire scheme is highly questionable.
* Had Respondent No. 1 not been vigilant of their rights, the public funds would have continued to be misappropriated for private profiteering.

The facts speak for themselves, as per the Latin phrase "Res ipsa loquitur".
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment and directions are upheld by the Supreme Court. The Court finds no error in restraining the imposition and collection of user fees/tolls.
NTBCL has recovered the costs of the project and substantial profits, thus eliminating any justification for continued imposition or collection of user fees or tolls.

The Court also clarifies that the matter pertaining to outdoor licensing fees between NOIDA and NTBCL does not fall within the purview of the present challenge. The said matter shall be heard and decided separately on its own merit.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the grant of bail to an accused under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The High Court had granted bail to the respondent on the ground that there was a delay in complying with Section 52A of the Act, which deals with the procedure for disposal of seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court erred in granting bail solely based on the delay in compliance with Section 52A. They contended that any procedural irregularity or illegality would not make the entire evidence collected during the investigation, inadmissible. The appellants also pointed out that the High Court failed to consider the mandatory requirements under Section 37 of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the purpose of inserting Section 52A was to ensure the early disposal of seized contraband drugs and substances. It noted that any lapse or delayed compliance with Section 52A would be merely a procedural irregularity, which would neither entitle the accused to be released on bail nor vitiates the trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned order of the High Court. It remanded the case to the High Court for deciding the bail application afresh on merits and in accordance with law. The court also directed the Chief Justice to place the bail application before a different bench.
</JUDGMENT>

<FACTS>
The case involves appeals against the impugned judgments of the High Court. The appellants are parties in a dispute over immovable property and have challenged certain decisions made by the High Court. The facts of the case are not explicitly stated, but it appears that the disputes involve issues related to ownership and transfer of property.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court discusses several key points in the case, including:
* The Registration Act, 1908, and its provisions regarding compulsory registration of documents affecting immovable property.
* The importance of registration for providing public notice, preventing fraud and forgery, and ensuring that every person dealing with immovable property can rely on the statements contained in the registers maintained under the Act.
* A decision from an earlier order dated 15-5-2009 (2009) 7 SCC 363 : (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 126, which explained the objects and benefits of registration.
* The court also references a previous case, Surjeet Singh v. Gian Chand, (2012) 12 SCC 759, in which it was held that a power-of-attorney holder cannot claim any rights or interest in the property unless the principal has executed a registered document conveying such rights or interest to him.
* The court notes that the appellants have failed to demonstrate any error on the part of the High Court in passing the impugned judgment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes by stating that it has reached the conclusion that no error, not to speak of any error of law, could be said to have been committed by the High Court in passing the impugned judgment. As a result, the appeals stand dismissed, and parties shall bear their own costs. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiff, Respondent No.1, filed a suit in Special Civil Suit No.133 of 2009 against the defendants. The plaint averments showed that the plaintiff claimed to be the rightful owner of certain lands and sought declarations, injunctions, and other reliefs. The defendants were alleged to have played fraud on the plaintiff by obtaining compromise decrees in their favor.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff argued that the suit was not barred by limitation and that the defendants had committed fraud in obtaining the compromise decrees. The plaintiff claimed that they were the rightful owners of the lands and sought declarations, injunctions, and other reliefs.
The defendants argued that the suit was hopelessly barred by limitation and that the plaint averments did not disclose any cause of action. They also argued that the plea of fraud raised by the plaintiff was vague and general, and that the bar under Order XXIII Rule 3A of CPC applied to third parties as well.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that limitation is a mixed question of fact and law, but in cases where it is glaring from the plaint averments that the suit is hopelessly barred by limitation, the courts should not be hesitant in granting the relief. The court also noted that the plaintiff and their predecessors did not take any steps to assert their title and rights in time.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the plaint was liable to be rejected at the threshold under Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC, as the litigation appeared to be a clear abuse of process. The court allowed the application filed by the appellants under Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC and rejected the plaint in Special Civil Suit No.133 of 2009.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a dispute over the status of the appellants, who are challenging their classification as unsecured creditors under a loan agreement. The loan agreement, also known as the Debt Obligation (DoH), contains provisions for hypothecation and guarantees. The appellants argue that they should be considered secured creditors due to the existence of these provisions. The case has proceeded through various stages, including an order from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and a subsequent appeal to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The appellants argue that:
- They should be considered secured creditors due to the existence of hypothecation and guarantee provisions in the DoH.
- The definition of "claim" under Section 3(6) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) includes rights to payment that exist or arise from breach of contract, even if they cannot be enforced due to the applicability of a moratorium.
- The severability clause in sub-clause (vi) of clause 16 of the DoH means that even if one provision is invalid, it will not affect the remaining provisions.
- The NCLAT's judgment was incorrect and should be set aside in favor of the NCLT's order.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court notes:
- That the NCLAT did not hold against the appellants on the ground that accepting their case would modify the Resolution Plan.
- That an earlier order from the NCLAT had noted that the Resolution Plan was approved subject to the disposal of pending applications, including those related to the appellants' status.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court rules:
- The impugned judgment and order passed by the NCLAT cannot be sustained.
- The order dated 2nd March 2021 of the NCLT deserves to be upheld.
- The impugned order of the NCLAT is quashed and set aside, and the order dated 2nd March 2021 passed by the NCLT is restored.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the lease of a property allocated under the 1925 Act for the purpose of providing accommodation to poorer classes. The respondent (Respondent No.1) seeks to redirect this property towards commercial exploitation, which is contrary to the original agreement and statutory purpose.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court include:

*   The respondent's attempt to commercially exploit the property would erode the foundation of the original agreement and nullify its intended social function.
*   Such a departure from the intended purpose would not only be a breach of lease conditions but also subvert the policy that animated the entire statutory regime.
*   The legislation and contract work in tandem to ensure urban improvement aligns with the welfare of weaker segments, and diverting this resource towards profit-making ventures would do nothing to alleviate the conditions of marginalized communities.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations made by the court include:

*   The respondent's actions amount to an abuse of beneficial legislation, which was intended to secure broader societal goals such as better sanitation, improved living standards, and well-planned urban growth that includes and benefits marginalized communities.
*   Allowing the respondent to disregard these obligations would set a precedent where statutory schemes designed to uplift vulnerable groups could be co-opted for purely commercial ends, undermining trust and faith between public authorities, private actors, and the most vulnerable segments of the population.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:

*   The entire arrangement is anchored on a quid pro quo, where the property is leased on special terms to ensure that less-privileged individuals receive tangible benefits.
*   When the lessee attempts to convert this arrangement into a vehicle for commercial gain, it repudiates the fundamental bargain and betrays the public trust reposed in the private entity to serve a greater good.
*   The court allows the appeal, sets aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, and dismisses the writ petition.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the legitimacy and paternity of the respondent, with the Appellant (Mr. Raju Kurian) being the father in question. The Original Suit was filed by Mr. Kurian's wife to establish her son's legitimacy and entitlement to inheritance. However, due to a technical issue, the suit was dismissed, and the respondent went on to file a Maintenance Case (MC No. 224/2007) against Mr. Kurian.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant argued that the Family Court erred in reopening the Maintenance Petition when the self-imposed condition was not satisfied. The Appellant also claimed that the principle of res judicata barred further proceedings on the legitimacy issue, as it had already been conclusively decided by the High Court in 2011.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observation is that the case has taken over two decades to resolve and has caused significant distress for the parties involved. The court also noted that allowing such repeated litigation sets a bad precedent and could open the floodgates for similar cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the Impugned Judgment of the High Court dated 21.05.2018 and of the Family Court dated 09.11.2015, with the following directions:

i. Legitimacy determines paternity under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, until the presumption is successfully rebutted by proving ‘non-access’;
ii. The Munsiff Court and the Sub-Judge Court possessed jurisdiction to entertain the Original Suit, which dealt with the question of the legitimacy of the Respondent;
iii. The Family Court, Alappuzha erred in reopening the Maintenance Petition when the self-imposed condition was not satisfied;
iv. The impugned proceedings, initiated by the Respondent, are barred by the principle of res judicata;
v. The proceedings in MC No. 224/2007 before the Family Court, Alappuzha stand quashed;
vi. Any claim by the Respondent based upon the perceived relationship of paternity qua the Appellant stands negated; and
vii. The Respondent is presumed to be the legitimate son of Mr. Raju Kurian.

The instant appeal was allowed in the above terms.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals and writ petitions seeking to stay prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (N.I. Act), relying on the interim moratorium under Section 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The appellants/petitioners argue that the decision of the High Court dealing with proceedings under section 14 IBC is not relevant to the facts of this case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellants/petitioners are:

* The decisions relied on by the High Court dealt with proceedings under section 14 IBC and not the proceedings under section 96 IBC, which makes them irrelevant to this case.
* The decision in Dilip B. Jiwrajka (supra) is not relevant to the facts of this case as it related to the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the IBC and the applicability of moratorium to a proceeding under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881 was not the subject matter.
* The provision enabling the debtor to approach the Tribunal under Section 94 is meant to postpone civil actions to recover any debt, but it does not stall criminal prosecution.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:

* The object of moratorium or for that purpose, the provision enabling the debtor to approach the Tribunal under Section 94 is not to stall the criminal prosecution.
* Criminal liability for dishonoring cheques ensures that individuals who engage in commercial transactions are held accountable for their actions.
* Allowing the appellants/petitioners to evade prosecution under Section 138 by invoking the moratorium would undermine the very purpose of the N.I. Act, 1881.

</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that:

* The prayer of the appellants / petitioners to stay the prosecution under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881, relying on the interim moratorium under Section 96 IBC, cannot be entertained.
* Therefore, the judgments/orders passed by the different High Courts affirming the orders of the trial court, which had rightly refused to stay the section 138 proceedings, need not be interfered with by the court.
* All the criminal appeals and writ petitions are dismissed.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves several appeals arising out of writ petitions filed by respondents against the orders granting anticipatory bail to them in various complaint cases. The respondents are accused of committing serious offences, and the Special Court had issued bailable warrants, non-bailable warrants, and initiated proclamation proceedings against them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the petitioners (appellants) argued against the grant of anticipatory bail to the respondents, citing the seriousness of the alleged offences and the efforts made by the Special Court to ensure their appearance.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had granted anticipatory bail to the respondents despite the Special Court's efforts to bring them to justice. The High Court's orders were set aside by the Supreme Court, which held that the said orders were perverse and untenable at law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned orders dated 29.03.2023 and 20.04.2023 passed by the High Court granting anticipatory bail to the respondents. The respondents are directed to surrender themselves before the Special Court within one week from the date of the order. The bail applications of the respondents shall be decided by the Special Court in accordance with law.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between Inox and the defendant regarding infringement of intellectual property rights. The plaintiff, Inox, filed a suit claiming that the defendant's use of "Proprietary Engineering Drawings" constitutes copyright infringement, as well as other related claims such as infringement of literary work, confidential information, and know-how.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that Inox's argument is centered around the alleged copyright infringement and other related IP rights claims. The defendant's counterarguments may include disputing the ownership or authenticity of the "Proprietary Engineering Drawings" and potentially arguing that their use does not constitute copyright infringement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Commercial Court initially rejected Inox's suit under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC, leading to an appeal. The High Court intervened and directed the Commercial Court to reconsider the matter, ultimately upholding its decision to reject the application but directing the court to conduct a trial to discern the true nature of the "Proprietary Engineering Drawings" and other related IP rights claims.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's decision is upheld, rejecting Inox's application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. The Commercial Court is directed to deliver its decision on the pending application seeking interim injunction within two months and conduct a trial to determine the true nature of the "Proprietary Engineering Drawings" and other related IP rights claims within one year.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiff filed a suit against the defendant - Union of India, raising legal issues regarding the continuance of registration and investigation by CBI in its area after withdrawal of consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act.
The plaintiff's case is that the three conditions under Sections 3, 5, and 6 of the DSPE Act must be fulfilled for CBI to exercise its powers in any State. It also argues that the CBI cannot continue to register cases after withdrawal of consent by the State Government.
The defendant challenged the maintainability of the suit, raising various contentions including constitutional overreach and lack of jurisdiction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments on behalf of the plaintiff:
* The DSPE Act requires the three conditions (notification under Section 3, order extending power under Section 5, and consent under Section 6) to be fulfilled for CBI to exercise its powers in any State.
* After withdrawal of consent by the plaintiff, the CBI cannot continue to register cases and exercise its powers under the DSPE Act.
* The plaintiff has made out a cause of action against the defendant as it is established by the defendant, its powers are controlled by the defendant, and its functioning is under the superintendence of the defendant.

Arguments on behalf of the defendant:
* The legal right which is the subject of dispute must arise in the context of the Constitution and federalism itself.
* The plaintiff's case has no merit as it does not indicate any constitutional or federal issue.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
* The Court observed that the averments in the plaint cannot be read in isolation but are to be read in entirety.
* The Court noted that the plaintiff's case is based on the interpretation of DSPE Act and judgments of this Court, including State of Rajasthan and Others v. Union of India and Others (supra).
* The Court stated that the preliminary objection does not merit acceptance and for reasons given hereinbefore, are rejected.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that:
* The contentions raised by the defendant do not merit acceptance and for the reasons given hereinbefore, are rejected.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the validity of certain regulations (Regulations of 2016) framed by the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) under the Electricity Act, 2003. The Regulations impose conditions on open access consumers in the state of Rajasthan, including scheduling requirements and penalties for non-compliance.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents (RERC and others) argued that the Regulations were framed to ensure equitable treatment of all market participants while safeguarding the integrity of the power grid. They contended that the conditions imposed by the Regulations are necessary for maintaining discipline in power scheduling and preventing unfair advantage by open access consumers.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court upheld the validity of the Regulations, noting that any inconvenience caused or hardship faced by captive power generators does not make the regulations illegal. The court also observed that the appellants failed to establish that the impugned regulations are in contravention of their rights protected under Part-III of the Constitution or that they have been enacted without competence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals and upheld the orders of the High Court. The court held that the Regulations of 2016 are in consonance with the objects of the Electricity Act, 2003, and have been framed as per the competence available under Section 181 read with Section 42 of the Act.

<Facts>
The case involves an FIR registered under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act against the appellants for allegedly publishing or transmitting material that is obscene, lascivious, or appealing to prurient interests, and/or having the effect of tending to deprave and corrupt persons. The complaint was filed regarding excessive usage of vulgar expletives, swear words, and profanities in a TV show.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that there is no case made out under Section 67 or Section 67A of the IT Act as there is no allegation of any 'sexually explicit act or conduct' in the complaint. They also pointed out that the offence of Section 67A is not at all made out.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that a court must exercise its jurisdiction to quash an FIR or criminal complaint when the allegations made therein, taken prima facie, do not disclose the commission of any offence. The court also noted that there could be a connect between Section 67A and Section 67 themselves, but in this case, no such connection is established.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals against the judgment of the High Court and set aside the judgment of the High Court, quashing FIR 403/2023 registered at Police Station Mukherjee Nagar, Delhi dated 16.04.2023 under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act against the appellants herein.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a 28-year-old accused who brutally murdered four persons, including an unarmed child and an aged lady. The act was pre-planned and premeditated. The accused has been in jail for 18 years and 4 months and the case is based on circumstantial evidence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court followed the Swamy Shraddananda principle while imposing sentence for the offence under Section 302 IPC, which states that a person convicted of murder should be imprisoned for at least 30 years without remission. However, the Supreme Court is inclined to modify the sentence from 30 years to 25 years imprisonment without remission.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The conduct report of the accused from the Jail Authorities indicates that he has been entrusted with prison labour work and has a satisfactory conduct record in prison. The accused tried to commit suicide after committing the dastardly act, showing remorse. These factors are considered as mitigating circumstances.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upholds the judgment of the High Court regarding the conviction of the accused under Sections 302, 449, and 309 IPC. However, it modifies the sentence imposed by the High Court for the offence under Section 302 IPC from 30 years imprisonment without remission to 25 years imprisonment without remission.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the constitutional validity of an order of detention passed against an individual, with specific reference to Article 22(4) of the Constitution of India. The order was challenged in the High Court, which upheld it. The present appeal is filed before the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellant include:
* The Advisory Board comprising High Court judges or their equivalent was not properly constituted as required under the law.
* The order of detention was passed without considering the constitutional safeguards enshrined in Article 22(4) of the Constitution.
* The detaining authority's satisfaction is subjective and does not withstand scrutiny under Article 22(5) of the Constitution.
* The Advisory Board failed to conduct a thorough and robust scrutiny of the order of detention as required by law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations made by the Court include:
* The requirement of having persons who have been or are qualified to be High Court judges in the Advisory Board is not an empty formality, but is intended to ensure that orders of detention are put to robust scrutiny and examined as they would be by any ordinary court of law.
* The Advisory Board must consider each and every aspect of the order of detention, including whether the detention is necessary in the eyes of law, and not just the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority.
* An Advisory Board setup under a preventive detention legislation is required to undertake a proper and thorough scrutiny of an order of detention placed before it by appreciating all aspects and angles before expressing any definite opinion in its report.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
* The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court are set aside.
* The order of detention is quashed and set aside.
* The appellant detenu is set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case.
* The connected Criminal Appeal No. ......... of 2024 @ SLP (Cri) No. 3391 of 2024 of the co-detenu is also allowed for the very same reasons and is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the approval of a resolution plan by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for a company in insolvency. The appellant, a statutory body and secured creditor, had submitted its claim but was not served notice of the meeting of the Committee of Creditors (COC). The resolution plan projected the appellant as one who did not submit its claim.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant were centered around the fact that the NCLT and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had failed to consider crucial aspects while approving the resolution plan. These included:
* The appellant was not served notice of the meeting of the COC.
* The entire proceedings up to the stage of approval of the resolution plan were ex parte to the appellant.
* The resolution plan projected the appellant as one who did not submit its claim, despite the fact that it had submitted its claim and was a secured creditor by operation of law.
* The resolution plan did not meet all the parameters laid down in sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) read with Regulations 37 and 38 of the CIRP Regulations, 2016.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court were that neither the NCLT nor NCLAT had taken note of these crucial aspects while deciding the application/appeal of the appellant. This led to a violation of the principles of natural justice and fairness in the proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court was as follows:
* The appeals of the appellant were allowed.
* The impugned order dated 24.11.2022 was set aside.
* The order dated 04.08.2020 passed by the NCLT approving the resolution plan was set aside.
* The resolution plan was sent back to the COC for re-submission after satisfying the parameters set out by the IBC as exposited above.
* There shall be no order as to costs.

<FACTS>
The case involves land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The notifications for Section 4 and Section 6 were issued on different dates in various villages, including Akoli (Bk) and Akoli (Kd). The Special Land Acquisition Officer published awards at different rates per hectare. Reference Courts allowed landowners' claims for compensation at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The claimants argued that the market value of the land should be considered for compensation, while the State argued that the award rate was sufficient. The claimants also submitted evidence to support their claims for higher compensation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court dismissed several First Appeals filed by both the claimants and the State. The court relied on previous judgments in similar cases and found that the Reference Courts had correctly awarded compensation at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Both the Civil Appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs.
The court affirmed its previous findings in LAC Nos. 183/2000, 53/2005, and 183/2002, which had awarded compensation at Rs. 100/- per sq. ft.

The petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 was filed by the petitioner within a period of three years from the date when the respondent failed to comply with the notice of invocation of arbitration issued by the petitioner. The notice for invocation of arbitration was received by the respondent on 29.11.2022.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case were centered around the issue of limitation in relation to a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996. It was argued that while considering the issue of limitation, the courts should satisfy themselves on two aspects by employing a two-pronged test: first, whether the petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is barred by limitation; and secondly, whether the claims sought to be arbitrated are ex-facie dead claims and are thus barred by limitation on the date of commencement of arbitration proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the present arbitration petition having been filed within a period of three years from the date when the respondent failed to comply with the notice of invocation of arbitration issued by the petitioner is not hit by limitation. The notice for invocation of arbitration having been issued by the petitioner within a period of three years from the date of accrual of cause of action, the claims cannot be said to be ex-facie dead or time-barred on the date of commencement of the arbitration proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the present petition and appointed Shri Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Former Judge of the Supreme Court of India, to act as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator including other modalities shall be fixed in consultation with the parties. All other rights and contentions are kept open for the parties to raise before the Arbitrator.

The court also noted that the appellant is 78 years old and has health issues, which might impact her ability to flee or tamper with evidence.

<FACTS>
The case involves a public servant who was implicated for offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The Special Court had passed an order of remand against the public servant. The High Court had set aside the remand order and quashed the FIR registered against the public servant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, prohibits the investigation or inquiry into offenses committed by a public servant in purported exercise of official functions or duties without the approval of the Central Government. The appellant claimed that the absence of such approval rendered the FIR and subsequent remand order invalid.
The State argued that Section 17A is applicable only to offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, as amended by the Amendment Act, 2018, and not to offenses existing prior to the amendment. The State also claimed that even in the absence of approval under Section 17A, it would not vitiate the proceedings or be a ground to quash the FIR.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Bench observed that Section 17A would be applicable to offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, as amended by the Amendment Act, 2018, and not to offenses existing prior to the amendment. The Bench also noted that even in the absence of approval under Section 17A, it would neither vitiate the proceedings nor be a ground to quash the FIR.

<FACTS>
The reference made to this Court is a case related to the automatic vacation of stay orders under Article 226(3) of the Constitution of India. The court is considering whether a stay order should automatically stand vacated on the expiry of a particular period or if an application needs to be filed and decided by a speaking order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of automatic vacation:
* The provision under Article 226(3) provides for automatic vacation of the stay order if the application is not decided within two weeks.
* Delay on part of the court in deciding the proceedings or any application therein would not be detrimental to any party.

Arguments against automatic vacation:
* Filing of an application for vacating the stay order is a sine qua non for triggering the automatic vacation of the stay order under Article 226(3).
* Grant of interim stay order should be by a speaking order, and therefore, a stay order once granted cannot be vacated otherwise than by a speaking order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that:
* The provision under Article 226(3) is in respect to petitions filed before the High Court invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court.
* The principles behind the said provision can always be extended to other proceedings as has been done in Asian Resurfacing.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The reference made to this Court is answered and disposed of accordingly. A reasoned stay order once granted in any civil or criminal proceedings, if not specified to be time-bound, would remain in operation till the decision of the main matter or until and unless an application is moved for its vacation and a speaking order is passed adhering to the principles of natural justice either extending, modifying, varying or vacating the same.

<FACTS>
The case is related to an acquisition under the Acquisition Act, 2013. The market value of the land must be computed under Section 26 of the Acquisition Act, 2013 for determining compensation. The Commissioner has applied the Collector's Guidelines by using the rate provided for non-converted agricultural land and supplemented this amount by accounting for the assets attached to the land and adding the solatium payable.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, argued that the circle rate is not the baseline or floor rate and is too high. The Commissioner's calculation of compensation was based on the circle rate fixed for the year 2014-2015 under the Collector's Guidelines.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that concerned authorities should fix circle rates scientifically and in accordance with the law, ensuring they are neither inflated nor disproportionately low. The public authorities must adhere to the same when citizens are required to pay stamp duty on the notified circle rate.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the computation in the award passed by the Commissioner directing payment of compensation on the basis of the circle rate. The appeals filed by the appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, were dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.

The case involves a reference on recruitment process, eligibility criteria, and appointment. The Supreme Court is answering the reference in terms of the following conclusions:
1. Recruitment process commences from the issuance of advertisement calling for applications and ends with filling up of vacancies.
2. Eligibility criteria for being placed in the Select List, notified at the commencement of the recruitment process, cannot be changed midway through the recruitment process unless the extant Rules so permit, or the advertisement, which is not contrary to the extant Rules, so permit.
3. The decision in K. Manjusree (supra) lays down good law and is not in conflict with the decision in Subash Chander Marwaha (supra).
4. Recruiting bodies, subject to the extant Rules, may devise appropriate procedure for bringing the recruitment process to its logical end provided the procedure so adopted is transparent, non-discriminatory/non-arbitrary and has a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved.
5. Extant Rules having statutory force are binding on the recruiting body both in terms of procedure and eligibility. However, where the Rules are non-existent, or silent, administrative instructions may fill in the gaps.
6. Placement in the select list gives no indefeasible right to appointment. The State or its instrumentality for bona fide reasons may choose not to fill up the vacancies. However, if vacancies exist, the State or its instrumentality cannot arbitrarily deny appointment to a person within the zone of consideration in the select list.

<FACTS>
The petitioners challenged the validity of certain provisions in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The respondents initiated a public consultation process to amend the MMDR Act, but the petitioners claimed that the Explanation(s) appended to Rule 38 of the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 2016, and Rule 45 of the Mining Concession Rules, 2017, caused cascading impact on royalty.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the current system of calculating the 'average sale price' by virtue of the Explanation(s) causes a cascading impact on royalty, which is contrary to the intent and spirit of the MMDR Act. The respondents argued that they are in the process of revising the policy and have initiated a public consultation process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that since the respondents are already aware of the anomaly in computing royalty and are reconsidering their policy, it would not comment further on the provisions in question. However, this decision would not preclude the petitioners from challenging the final policy decision that the respondents may take after completing the ongoing consultation process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court granted the respondents a period of 2 months to conclude the public consultation process and take a final decision on the cascading impact of royalty. The challenge to the validity of Explanation(s) appended to Rule 38 of the MCR, 2016, and Rule 45 of the MCDR, 2017, was answered accordingly.

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the appellants (Central Bank of India and another) may have argued against the actions taken by the respondents (Smt. Prabha Jain and others) regarding loan disputes or title search reports.
</ARGUMENTS>

The Supreme Court observed that the High Court did not commit any error in passing the impugned order. The Court also noted that the civil suits shall now proceed further expeditiously in accordance with law.
Additionally, the Court made some observations regarding the need for standard guidelines for fees and costs associated with title search reports to ensure high-quality services.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed by the Central Bank of India and another against Smt. Prabha Jain and others. The Court vacated the interim order earlier granted by it and directed the civil suits to proceed further expeditiously in accordance with law.

The relevant portions from the judgment are:

"The High Court did not commit any error in passing the impugned order... The civil suits shall now proceed further expeditiously in accordance with law."

"In such circumstances referred to above, no error not to speak of any error of law could be said to have been committed by the High Court in passing the impugned order."

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between two banks, the appellant bank and respondent no. 1 bank, regarding an equitable mortgage created by respondent no. 1 over certain properties. The dispute arose due to the fact that respondent no. 1 had not informed the appellant bank about its prior unregistered agreement of sale. The High Court had passed an order in favor of respondent no. 1 bank, which was challenged by the appellant bank.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* Appellant bank argued that it did not have knowledge of the prior unregistered agreement of sale and therefore could not be held liable for its consequences.
* Respondent no. 1 bank argued that the prior unregistered agreement of sale was valid and created an equitable mortgage over the properties, which took precedence over any later registered transactions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had failed to notice the distinction between an 'equitable mortgage' and a 'legal mortgage'. The court also got carried away by the fact that the first charge was that of the Central Bank and not of the appellant bank. It is observed that any title or interest created by an unregistered document is liable to be defeated under the rule of priority by a valid later and legal sale or mortgage evidenced by a duly registered document.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court, and directed that the amount of Rs. 51 lakh lying deposited with the DRT be disbursed along with interest in favor of the appellant bank. The court also directed the Registry to send a copy of its judgment to all the High Courts with further request to each of the High Courts to forward the judgment to the DRTs and DRAT benches.

The board had recommended that the aspirant not be granted admission due to "functional incompetence".
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The necessity of creating a supernumerary seat for the medical aspirant with disability.
- The requirement for extending reasonable accommodations to enable the aspirant to pursue the MBBS course successfully.
- The need to protect the aspirant from victimization.
- The obligation on the government to issue fresh guidelines for admitting persons with disabilities into medical courses, in compliance with court judgments and contemporary advancements in disability justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations were made during the case:
- The Disability Assessment Boards should eschew from using a benchmark model to test functional competence.
- The boards must include a doctor or health professional with disability as per the directions of the first respondent dated 24 March 2022.
- Reasonable accommodation is a gateway right for persons with disabilities, and its non-availability amounts to discrimination and violates substantive equality.
- The inclusion of persons with disability in the medical profession would enhance healthcare quality and meet the preambular virtue of fraternity and guarantees in Articles 21, 19, 14, and 15 of the Constitution.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute regarding the applicability of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to services rendered by lawyers. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) had allowed a complaint against a lawyer for deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The argument presented was that the Consumer Protection Act does not apply to professional services, including those of lawyers. It was contended that the Act is intended to protect consumers who purchase goods or hire services and not professionals who render services to their clients. The Supreme Court relied on international practices and the regulation of the legal profession in India to support this argument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court noted that the Advocates Act, 1961 regulates the conduct of lawyers in India and is a complete code in itself. It observed that the regulation of the legal profession is a sui generis field and requires specialized legislation. The court also highlighted the importance of certainty and finality of decision-making in the justice delivery system.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the services rendered by lawyers are not covered under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It overruled the NCDRC's order allowing a complaint against a lawyer for deficiency in service and set aside the impugned order dated 06.08.2007.
</JUDGMENT>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint against public servants under section 4 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The respondent moved the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate for action against the named public servant. However, it is mentioned that no administrative enquiry report was called for by the Magistrate.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the direction in the impugned judgment for penal prosecution is unsustainable and contrary to the proviso to section 4(2) of the Act of 1989. They contended that the Metropolitan Magistrate applied his discretion correctly under section 156(3) of the CrPC, concluding that no offence was made out.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the purpose of an administrative enquiry is to find out the conduct of a public servant against whom allegations of failure of duty or function are made. The court also observed that the Magistrate's decision would be legally permissible if it adhered to the procedure of taking cognizance on the recommendation of the administrative enquiry.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the impugned judgment is unsustainable and contrary to the proviso to section 4(2) of the Act of 1989. The Metropolitan Magistrate's decision was found to be correct and unassailable in the circumstances of the case. Therefore, the Criminal Appeal was allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was convicted of murdering his wife in the year 1995. The incident occurred after he had divorced her using triple talaq in 1992, but later took her back home. The trial court convicted him in 1998 and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On appeal before the High Court, the substantive order of sentence was suspended, and he was released on bail in 1998. However, it took 16 years for the High Court to decide the appeal, which ultimately came to be dismissed on 23.05.2014. The appellant had been undergoing life imprisonment since then.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's defense or arguments are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that his lawyer argued for a reduction in sentence or remission of sentence due to the mitigating circumstances mentioned in the case, such as the age and duration of imprisonment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include that the appellant had taken undue advantage and acted in a cruel manner even if it was assumed that he was provoked by his wife. The court also noted that almost half of the appellant's life had been spent undergoing the ordeal of criminal prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court affirmed the judgment and order of conviction passed by the trial court, holding the appellant guilty of the offence of murder of his wife. The court observed that there was no error in the decision made by the trial court. However, considering the mitigating circumstances, the court granted liberty to the appellant to prefer an appropriate representation addressed to the State Government praying for remission of sentence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court of Judicature for the State of [Not specified] issued a Full Court Resolution on 30 November 2021 prescribing that candidates for appointment to the Higher Judicial Service should have a minimum of 50% both in the written test as well as in the viva voce independently. The Resolution was initially issued on 29 January 2013, but modified in 2021. The State Government referred the matter to the Union Government instead of following the consultation process with the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context and the judgments cited, it can be inferred that the High Court argued that:
- The State Government traveled beyond the remit of the consultation with the High Court by referring the matter to the Union Government.
- The High Court's decision was a legitimate exercise of its power under Article 235 of the Constitution.
The State Government likely argued that:
- The High Court's decision was arbitrary and a betrayal of trust.
- The State Government relied on an earlier judgment of the Supreme Court to justify its position.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The importance of the control wielded by the High Courts over the District Judiciary is emphasized in numerous decisions, including [State of West Bengal v. Nripendra Nath Bagchi, 1965 SCC OnLine SC 22; High Court of Punjab and Haryana v. State of Haryana, (1975) 1 SCC 843, High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan v. PP Singh, (2003) 4 SCC 239]. The High Courts have the power to prescribe criteria for appointment to the Higher Judicial Service under Article 235 of the Constitution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
- The State Government was plainly in error in finding fault with the process being followed by the High Court and concluding that the decision of the High Court amounted to an arbitrary exercise of power.
- The impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 20 December 2023 did not suffer from any legal or other infirmity.
- The appeals shall accordingly stand dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around an appeal against the conviction of two appellants under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act). The appellants were charged with various offenses related to possession and sale of prohibited substances. The trial court convicted them based on the confessional statements made by the appellants during an inquiry conducted under Section 67 of the NDPS Act.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The main argument presented by the defense was that the confessional statements made by the appellants were inadmissible as evidence under Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (IEA). The defense relied on a previous judgment of the Supreme Court in Tofan Singh vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir, which held that confessional statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act are not admissible as evidence against an accused person.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observed that the trial court had failed to consider the previous judgment of the Supreme Court in Tofan Singh vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir, which held that confessional statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act are not admissible as evidence against an accused person.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals and set aside the conviction of the appellants. The court granted benefit of doubt to the appellants and acquitted them of all charges. The court relied on the previous judgment in Tofan Singh vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir, which held that confessional statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act are not admissible as evidence against an accused person.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The suit agreement was found to be insufficiently stamped by the respondent. The respondent requested that the agreement be impounded and sent to the District Registrar to determine the deficit stamp duty and penalty payable. The trial court then called for a report from the District Registrar, but instead of allowing the District Registrar to determine the quantum of stamp duty and penalty, the Court imposed a penalty of ten times the deficit stamp duty under Section 34 of the Act.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the case. However, it can be inferred that the respondent argued for the impounding of the suit agreement to determine the deficit stamp duty and penalty payable, while the trial court's decision to impose a penalty of ten times the deficit stamp duty under Section 34 of the Act suggests that the Court was acting on behalf of the respondent.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the Court are not explicitly mentioned in the case. However, it can be inferred that the Court recognized the need for the District Registrar to determine the quantum of stamp duty and penalty payable under Section 39 of the Act, rather than imposing a fixed penalty under Section 34 of the Act.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The trial court's decision to impose a penalty of ten times the deficit stamp duty under Section 34 of the Act was set aside by the Court. The case was remanded back to the trial court with directions to send the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999 to the District Registrar to determine the deficit stamp duty and penalty payable. Upon receipt of the compliance certificate from the District Registrar, the suit document was to be received in evidence without reference to any objection under the Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the impugned order of the High Court, which denied bail to the appellant. The appeal was heard by a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:

* The three-judge Bench decision in K.A. Najeeb (supra) is binding on the two-judge Bench and emphasizes the importance of granting bail to an accused-undertrial when their right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution has been infringed.
* The court must lean in favor of constitutionalism and the rule of law, which includes liberty as an intrinsic part. 
* In the given facts of a particular case, a constitutional court may decline to grant bail, but it would be wrong to say that under a particular statute, bail cannot be granted.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The right to life and personal liberty enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution is overarching and sacrosanct.
* A constitutional court cannot be restrained from granting bail to an accused-undertrial on account of restrictive statutory provisions in a penal statute if it finds that the right of the accused-undertrial under Article 21 of the Constitution has been infringed.
* The delay in trial pertaining to grave offences cannot be used as a ground to deny bail, but the court must consider the specific facts of each case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:

* The impugned order of the High Court is set aside and quashed.
* The appellant is directed to be released on bail subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, including:
	+ Trial court shall impound the passport and/or citizenship document(s) of the appellant.
	+ Appellant shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court.
	+ He shall appear before the trial court on each and every date of the trial.
	+ In addition to the above, the appellant shall mark his attendance before the police station once in every fortnight till conclusion of the trial.
	+ He shall not tamper with the evidence and shall not threaten the witnesses.
* If there is any violation of the bail conditions, it would be open to the prosecution to move the trial court for cancellation of bail.

The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the bail application of an individual, and it is related to two cases: ED Case No. HIU-II/14/2022 registered against the appellant by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and FIR No. RC0032022A0053 of 2022 registered against the appellant by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The case involves 493 witnesses, thousands of pages of documents, and over a lakh pages of digitized documents.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:

* The learned ASG argued that there is a possibility of tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses if the appellant is released on bail.
* The appellant's counsel argued that the appellant has deep roots in society and will not flee from the country, and conditions can be imposed to address the concern of the State.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The court noted that there is no possibility of tampering with documentary evidence since it is already seized by the prosecution.
* The court observed that the concern regarding influencing witnesses can be addressed by imposing stringent conditions on the appellant.
* The court stated that keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period would deprive his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court is as follows:

* The appeals are allowed, and the impugned judgment and order dated 21st May 2024 passed by the High Court of Delhi in Bail Application Nos. 1557 and 1559 of 2024 is quashed and set aside.
* The appellant is directed to be released on bail in connection with ED Case No. HIU-II/14/2022 registered against the appellant by the ED and FIR No. RC0032022A0053 of 2022 registered against the appellant by the CBI on furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- with two sureties of the like amount.
* The appellant shall surrender his passport with the Special Court.
* The appellant shall report to the Investigating Officer on every Monday and Thursday between 10-11 AM.
* The appellant shall not make any attempt either to influence the witnesses or to tamper with the evidence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a person who lost his money and lodged a complaint based on the information furnished by his employee, Ram Kishore. Ram Kishore was under police custody in the Police Station. The appellant caused the presence of Ram Kishore before the Police Station, leading to the registration of a custodial death case under FIR No.371/1993.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution case reveals that Ram Kishore was under the control of the police in the Police Station, which is the basis for lodging a complaint by the appellant. The appellant's action of causing Ram Kishore to be present before the Police Station cannot be grounds for implicating him in an offence, especially one as grave as custodial death.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The absence of ground for proceeding against the appellant based on the final report dated 21.02.2000 filed in Crime No.371/1993 of CBCID, U.P. Lucknow is noted. The High Court did not consider the matter in the manner required under law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal must succeed due to the absence of ground for proceeding against the appellant based on the final report dated 21.02.2000. The order and judgment passed by the High Court are set aside, and the application filed by the appellant under Section 227, Cr.PC, is allowed. Consequently, the appellant stands discharged.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves three appellants who were acquitted by the High Court, but their acquittal was set aside by the Supreme Court. The State Government is responsible for appointing Public Prosecutors and providing assistance to Courts.
The Public Prosecutor in this case failed to present relevant evidence and showed partiality towards the prosecution.
The appellants suffered due to the mistakes of the Public Prosecutor and the Court's reliance on incomplete information.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' lawyers argued that the Public Prosecutor's actions were unfair and compromised the trial process.
The State Government was responsible for appointing a competent Public Prosecutor who failed to discharge their duties properly.
The Supreme Court observed that Judges, defense counsel, and Public Prosecutors all have a responsibility to correct errors in the judicial process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court noted that the sheer pressure of work can lead to mistakes by Judges and that all parties involved in the trial owe a duty to correct errors.
The State Government's appointment of the Public Prosecutor was questioned, and they were held responsible for any losses suffered by the appellants due to their failure to appoint a competent Public Prosecutor.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the High Court's judgment, and directed the State Government to pay Rs. 5,00,000/- each to the three appellants as compensation within four weeks.
The bail bonds furnished by the appellants were discharged, and the Registry was instructed to notify the matter once again after four weeks to report compliance of payment of compensation as awarded.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Supreme Court's decision regarding the applicability of the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) to the assesses. The MAT was introduced in 1996 and amended in 2005, leading to a dispute over whether it should be applied retrospectively or prospectively.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Solicitor General argued that the MAT should be given prospective effect, considering the substantial amount of time since the introduction of the law. He also pointed out that the court's decision could have significant consequences for the assesses, who may face revival of cumulative demands amounting to Rupees three thousand crores.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the delay in the proceedings should not be at the expense of the assesses. It also noted that a few States did not wish to collect the dues accrued before the decision in MADA (supra), which is the prerogative of the State legislatures.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court rejected the submission that MADA (supra) should be given prospective effect. The conditionalities directed by the court include:

* Demands of tax shall not operate on transactions made prior to 1 April 2005;
* Time for payment of demand of tax shall be staggered in instalments over a period of twelve years commencing from 1 April 2026; and
* Levy of interest and penalty on demands made for the period before 25 July 2024 shall stand waived for all the assesses.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against two Appellants, including Rujira Banerjee, the wife of an accused person in a money laundering case. The ED had summoned the Appellants to its office in Delhi under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The Appellants challenged the summons, alleging that they were issued without territorial jurisdiction and were not justified.
The complaint alleged that Rs.168 Crores were received by an Inspector from a co-accused person to be delivered to his political bosses, and the money was transferred through vouchers to Delhi and Overseas. This established a nexus between the offense and the offenders with the territory of Delhi.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the summons were issued without territorial jurisdiction and were not justified. They also contended that the ED had no authority to summon them under Section 50 of the PMLA.
The ED, on the other hand, argued that they had sufficient grounds to issue the summons under Section 50 of the PMLA. They claimed that the Appellants were required to appear before them and produce documents as part of the investigation into the money laundering case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the ED has territorial jurisdiction in the matter, as a part of the offense had been allegedly committed by the accused persons in Delhi. The court also noted that the Appellant No.1 being a Member of Parliament has an official residence at Delhi.
The court further observed that the Appellants were bound to attend in person or through authorized agents and state the truth upon any subject respecting which they are examined or make statements, and produce documents as may be required under Section 50(3) of the PMLA.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that there was no illegality in the summons issued by the ED to the Appellants. The court dismissed both Appeals filed by the Appellants, stating that they were devoid of merits.
The court also noted that since the complaint is pending before the concerned Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, it did not express any opinion on the merits of the said Complaint.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Section 29A(4) and (5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The court is considering whether an application for extension of time period for passing an arbitral award can be maintained after the expiry of the twelve-month or the extended six-month period.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court discusses various provisions of Section 29A(4) and (5), including:
- Sub-section (4): The time limit for making of the award is one year from the date of the order referred to arbitration, which can be extended by six months with the permission of the court.
- Sub-section (5): An application for extension of period of arbitral tribunal is to be decided by the court.
- Proviso: The mandate of the arbitral tribunal continues where an application under sub-section (5) is pending.

The court also discusses various judicial precedents and legislative intent behind Section 29A(4) and (5), including:
- The power to extend time period for making of the award vests with the court, not with the arbitral tribunal.
- An interpretation which produces unreasonable results should be avoided in favor of a more acceptable, practical, and pragmatic construction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that an interpretation which produces cadaveric consequences resulting in unworkable or impracticable scenarios should be avoided. The legislative intent is to effectuate efficiency and expediency in the arbitral process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that an application for extension of time period for passing an arbitral award under Section 29A(4) read with Section 29A(5) is maintainable even after the expiry of the twelve-month or the extended six-month period. The court will be guided by the principle of sufficient cause and previous observations while adjudicating such extension applications.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent no.1 was granted bail by the High Court in connection with Crime 217/2019, registered with Police Station Kotwali, Nagpur.
The offences against which bail was granted include sections 409, 420, 467, 478, 471, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, as well as Section 3 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act.
The High Court imposed usual conditions for granting bail, including executing a PR bond of Rs. 16,000/- with one solvent surety of the like amount.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court held that the discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge of the High Court to grant bail to the respondent no.1 was not in tune with the principles that conventionally govern exercise of such power.
The Court observed that though respondent no.1 had already suffered incarceration for a period of about six months at the time when bail was granted, his release on bail could seriously lead to dissipation of the properties where investments have allegedly been made out of Society funds.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court erred in law by granting bail without imposing strict and additional conditions given the nature of the alleged offence.
Respondent no.1 had already suffered incarceration for a period of about six months at the time when bail was granted.
The interests of the victims of the scam have also to be factored in while considering bail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned order granting bail to respondent no.1.
Respondent No.1 is directed to surrender within a period of three weeks from today, failing which the trial Court shall proceed in accordance with law.
The Court clarified that its observations are limited to testing the legality of the impugued order and should not be treated as definitive/conclusive regarding respondent no.1 or any other accused.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, and 506 read with Section 34 IPC at P.S. Jalna. The FIR was registered on March 25, 2013, bearing Crime No. 81/2013. A chargesheet was later filed on July 30, 2013, bearing Chargesheet No. 123/2013.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that none of the ingredients of Sections 498A, 323, 504, and 506 read with Section 34 IPC are made out in the case. They also raised a technical argument regarding the jurisdiction of Jalna Police Station and the Chief Judicial Magistrate.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had passed an order on May 5, 2017, refusing to quash the FIR and chargesheet. However, this decision was appealed to the Supreme Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court, and quashed the FIR dated March 25, 2013, bearing Crime No. 81/2013 filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC at P.S. Jalna, as well as the chargesheet dated July 30, 2013, bearing Chargesheet No. 123/2013 in the above FIR.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant has been incarcerated for 15 months or more for the offence punishable under the PMLA. The trial of the scheduled offences and, consequently, the PMLA offence is not likely to be completed in three to four years or even more.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the learned counsel for the appellant relied on several decisions indicating that the appellant's influential position in the State may have resulted in a so-called compromise between the bribe givers and the bribe takers. Considering the apprehension of the appellant tampering with the evidence, stringent conditions must be imposed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observation made by the court is that there are cases where clean acquittal is granted by the criminal courts to the accused after very long incarceration as an undertrial. When we say clean acquittal, we are excluding the cases where the witnesses have turned hostile or there is a bona fide defective investigation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the appellant shall be enlarged on bail till the final disposal of CC No. 9 of 2023 pending before the Principal Session Judge, Chennai, on the following conditions:

a. The appellant shall furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs.25,00,000/­ (Rupees twenty-five lakhs only) with two sureties in the like amount;

b. The appellant shall not directly or indirectly attempt to contact or communicate with the prosecution witnesses and victims of the three scheduled offences in any manner. If it is found that the appellant directly or indirectly made even an attempt to contact any prosecution witness or victim in the scheduled as well as offences under the PMLA, it will be a ground to cancel the bail granted to the appellant;

<FACTS>
The case involves an FIR filed under Sections 336, 447, and 448 IPC by the Director of Deogarh Airport against several individuals. The FIR alleged that these individuals had entered the ATC office without permission. An investigation was conducted by the local police.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the Aircraft Act, 1934, and its Rules are a complete code in this matter. They contended that no complaint can be filed under the IPC for an alleged offense committed against the rules of the Airport (Security) Rules, 2011.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that no allegations were made by any officials of ATC regarding forcible entry or intimidation or insult or annoyance. The Director of Deogarh Airport was arrayed as an accused in the FIR. 
The Aircraft Act, 1934 is a special law dealing with safety and security of civil aviation and aerodrome.
A complaint can only be made/filed by an authorized officer under the Special Act i.e., the Aircrafts Act, 1934 before the concerned Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that since the Aircraft Act, 1934 is a complete code in this matter and its Section 12B is in the nature of a pre-condition for taking cognizance by a Court, the local police can only forward the material collected by it to such authorized officer. 
No case was made out against the respondents-accused persons under Sections 336, 447, and 448 IPC.
The appeals were dismissed with liberty to the Appellate-State of Jharkhand to forward the material collected by it during investigation to such authorized officer under the Aircraft Act, 1934 within four weeks.

The case involves Naresh Aneja, who is the appellant in the appeal before the Supreme Court. The matter pertains to a complaint filed by another individual (R.K. Aneja) against Naresh Aneja and R.K. Aneja's lawyer (not specified). The complainant alleged that Naresh Aneja had committed an offense against him, but the details of the offense are not provided in the case summary. 
The FIR No. 1074 of 2019 was filed by the police based on the complaint. An application was made under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to quash the criminal proceedings against Naresh Aneja.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's lawyer argued that there was no substance in the complaint and that allowing the case to proceed would be an abuse of the process of the court. The lawyer relied on various judgments of the Supreme Court, which emphasized the power of the High Court to quash proceedings if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the process of the court or that the ends of justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed.
The submissions and documents on record were considered by the Supreme Court in its judgment. The court noted that the sum total of the circumstances, submissions, and documents did not point to Naresh Aneja having committed any offense against the complainant.

<FACTS>
The plaintiff registered the instrument, which is possible only if it was handed over by Defendant No.1.
Defendant No.1 had no right to cancel the document unilaterally once it was declared as "gift".
The sale deed dated 10.19.1993 executed by Defendant No.1 / father is also invalid.
Other family members, namely Defendant Nos.3 and 4 supported the case of Respondent No.1/plaintiff.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Delivery of possession is not a necessary condition to validate a gift or settlement.
The factum of acceptance can be derived from the conduct of the parties.
The plaintiff was in possession of the original title deed when the suit was filed, indicating that Defendant No.1 had handed over the document earlier.
Once a gift has been acted upon, it cannot be unilaterally cancelled.
The receipt of the original document by the plaintiff and registration of the same would amount to acceptance of the gift.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The parties' conduct indicates that the document was treated as a "gift" from the beginning.
Defendant No.1 had no right to cancel the document unilaterally, and the Sub Registrar should not have registered the cancellation deed.
The case highlights the importance of examining the facts and circumstances surrounding the creation and execution of documents.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal is dismissed, confirming the judgment passed by the High Court.
The trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court had erroneously concluded that Ext.A1 document was a Will, without appreciating the law.
However, the High Court rightly set aside the concurrent judgments of the Courts below by treating the document as settlement.
The parties shall bear their own costs. Connected Miscellaneous Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

<FACTS>
The case involves a couple, Dinesh and Reena, who were granted a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. However, Reena refused to return to her matrimonial home despite the decree. Dinesh sought to protect himself from a claim by Reena for maintenance by projecting the disobeyed restitution decree as a defence.
Reena applied for maintenance under Section 125 CrPC, and the Family Court granted her maintenance at ₹10,000 per month. However, Dinesh challenged this order in the High Court, which held that Reena was not entitled to maintenance due to the disqualification under Section 125(4) CrPC.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:
- The prosecution argued that Reena had refused to return to her matrimonial home despite the decree for restitution of conjugal rights, making her ineligible for maintenance.
- The defense argued that the disqualification under Section 125(4) CrPC did not apply in this case, and Reena was entitled to maintenance as she had been abandoned by her husband.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
- The court noted that Dinesh's actions were inconsistent with his professed desire to reconcile with his wife. Despite securing a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, he did not attempt to execute it or seek reconciliation.
- The court also observed that Reena had sufficient reason to stay away from her husband due to the ill-treatment she suffered in her matrimonial home.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the Supreme Court is as follows:
- The court allowed Reena's appeal, setting aside the judgment of the High Court and restoring the order of the Family Court granting maintenance to Reena at ₹10,000 per month.
- Dinesh was directed to pay arrears of maintenance in three equal installments by 30.04.2025, 31.08.2025, and 31.12.2025, respectively.

<Facts>
The case involves the interpretation of a provision in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006. The provision requires that disputed amounts be deposited to avail statutory remedy before MSEFC. The issue arises when an assessee files a writ petition against an order/award of MSEFC despite having not paid the disputed tax amount.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are based on various judgments and interpretations of similar provisions. The main points include:

*   The provision in question vests in the appellate authority a power to deal with the appeal otherwise than by way of final disposal even if the disputed tax is not paid.
*   This interpretation enables the authority to exercise a judicial discretion to allow payment of the disputed tax even after the appeal is filed but before it is taken up for actual hearing.
*   The assessee may not be able to acquire an absolute stay of recovery of the tax until the dispute is resolved, but will be able to get breathing time to pay up the same where his case deserves it.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The observations made in the case are based on previous judgments and their interpretations. The main points include:

*   There is some divergence of opinion regarding alternative remedy when the disputed amount is required to be deposited to avail statutory remedy.
*   Cases like Shyam Kishore (supra) have attempted to find a solution to provide support in cases involving extreme hardship where the writ petition would not be dismissed on the ground of equally efficacious alternative remedy.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is that the court deems it appropriate to refer certain questions raised in the present appeal to a larger Bench of five Judges. The questions include:

*   Whether the ratio in M/s India Glycols Limited (supra) completely bars or prohibits maintainability of the writ petition before the High Court.
*   If the bar/prohibition is not absolute, when and under what circumstances will the principle/restriction of adequate alternative remedy not apply?
*   Whether members of MSEFC who undertake conciliation proceedings can themselves act as arbitrators of the arbitral tribunal in terms of Section 18 of the MSMED Act read with Section 80 of the A&C Act.

However, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) had also filed an application under Section 482 of the CrPC for quashing the criminal proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that taking cognizance by the CJM, Varanasi, was not done in accordance with the due process contemplated under the provisions of law. The appellant contended that the same was contrary to law and all orders passed pursuant thereto could not be sustained.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had earlier dismissed an SLP filed against its order dated 13.10.2015, which was in limine dismissal without giving any detailed reasons. However, this Court held that such a dismissal does not constitute any declaration of law or a binding precedent under Article 141 of the Constitution.

The case involves an appeal by the husband against a judgment of the High Court and a Judicial Magistrate's order, which led to his passport being impounded. The husband had applied under Article 142(1) of the Constitution for dissolution of marriage due to irretrievable breakdown. A show-cause notice was issued to him regarding the impounding of his passport without prior opportunity to be heard.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the husband's counsel were based on the principles of natural justice, which require that a person be given an opportunity to be heard before any action is taken against them. The counsel relied on several Supreme Court judgments, including Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P., to argue that impounding of passports or issuance of 'Red Corner Notice' should not be routine for persons residing outside India.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the act of impounding the husband's passport was carried out without granting him an opportunity to be heard, which is a clear violation of the principles of natural justice. The observations also highlighted the importance of following the established legal precedents and procedures in such matters.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the application filed by the husband under Article 142(1) of the Constitution for dissolution of marriage due to irretrievable breakdown of marriage. The court quashed and set aside the judgments/orders passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Howrah and the High Court. The court also ordered the release of the husband's passport within a period of one week from the date of the order. Additionally, the court directed the husband to deposit a sum of Rs. 25 lakhs as permanent alimony payable to his wife within two months from the date of the order.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute regarding the entitlement of a spouse to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse after their marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
The court is considering two questions:
(i) Whether a spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the 1955 Act.
(ii) Whether a court can grant maintenance pendente lite (interim maintenance) even if it comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act may be entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the 1955 Act, as long as the conduct of the parties is considered.
The grant of relief under Section 24 (maintenance pendente lite) is discretionary and can be granted even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act.
Equitable considerations do apply when the Court considers the prayer for maintenance under Section 25, as it lays down that while considering the prayer for granting relief under Section 25, the conduct of the parties must be considered.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
Sub-Section 1 of Section 25 uses the word "may", indicating that a grant of a decree under Section 25 is discretionary.
The conduct of the spouse who applies for maintenance is a relevant consideration when deciding whether to grant permanent alimony or maintenance under Section 25.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court answers the two questions as follows:
a. A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the 1955 Act, but whether such a relief can be granted or not always depends on the facts of each case and the conduct of the parties.
b. Even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act, the court is not precluded from granting maintenance pendente lite provided the conditions mentioned in Section 24 are satisfied.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the issue of refunding court fees for matters settled through Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods, specifically Lok Adalat and mediation. The appellant had filed a suit in a civil court and it was referred to Lok Adalat where it was amicably settled. However, the court fees paid by the appellant were not fully refunded.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that since the matter was settled through ADR methods, the full amount of court fees should not be refunded, citing the provision under Section 43 of the Maharashtra Court Fees Act (MCFA), 1959. The respondent further contended that Lok Adalat and mediation are distinct methods from each other and cannot be equated.
The appellant, on the other hand, argued that since the matter was settled amicably through ADR methods, they should be entitled to a full refund of court fees.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had suggested to the State legislature that there should be uniformity in court fees for matters settled through Lok Adalat and other forms of ADR. The State legislature subsequently amended the MCFA, 1959 by introducing Section 16A, which provides for a full refund of court fees in cases where the matter is disposed of through ADR methods.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the appeal lacked merit and was liable to be dismissed. However, considering the peculiar facts of the case, including the fact that the original dispute was settled amicably and the amount of court fees involved was not excessive, the Court granted the refund of the said amount in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The writ petition was filed by a candidate with disabilities, seeking to extend the benefits of the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) to all persons with disabilities in writing their examinations. The petitioner claimed that the Office Memorandum (OM) issued by the Respondent No.5 was discriminatory and failed to provide reasonable accommodation for candidates with disabilities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the OM's restrictions on extending benefits to only persons with blindness, low vision, leprosy-cured, hearing impairment, locomotor disability, mental retardation, mental illness, and muscular dystrophy were arbitrary and discriminatory. They contended that the RPwD Act requires reasonable accommodation for all persons with disabilities.
The petitioner also argued that the OM's requirement of a scribe certificate, which is valid only for six months, caused undue hardship to candidates in rural areas who had to wait for long periods to obtain a new certificate.
Additionally, the petitioner claimed that the OM failed to provide adequate grievance redressal mechanisms and sensitization programs for examination conducting bodies.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the OM issued by the Respondent No.5 was not in compliance with the RPwD Act, which requires reasonable accommodation for all persons with disabilities. The court noted that the OM's restrictions on extending benefits were arbitrary and discriminatory.
The court also observed that the OM failed to provide adequate grievance redressal mechanisms and sensitization programs for examination conducting bodies.
Furthermore, the court noted that the scribe certificate validity period of six months caused undue hardship to candidates in rural areas who had to wait for long periods to obtain a new certificate.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the Respondent No.5 to revisit the OM and remove its restrictions on extending benefits to only persons with specific disabilities. The court ordered that all authorities/recruitment agencies/examining bodies must uniformly follow the guidelines issued by the Respondent No.5.
Additionally, the court directed the establishment of a grievance redressal portal for candidates to register complaints before approaching the court. The court also ordered the extension of scribe certificate validity period and the setting up of incentive programs for scribes.
Finally, the court emphasized the importance of sensitizing examination conducting bodies and personnel on reasonable accommodation needs of persons with disabilities, as well as penalizing authorities/officials who fail to comply with the guidelines set out by the Respondent No.5.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the mutation of revenue records in respect of a subject land. The appellant had obtained a consent decree from the court, asserting their pre-existing rights to the land. However, the authorities below had refused to make the necessary mutations, citing that stamp duty was payable on the document pertaining to the mutation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the consent decree only asserted their pre-existing rights and did not create any new rights. Therefore, no stamp duty was payable on the document. The appellant also relied on Section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, which provides that stamp duty is not chargeable on an order/decree of the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the consent decree did not fall under the instruments mentioned in Schedule I or I-A of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. The decree only asserted the pre-existing rights of the appellant and did not transfer any new right. Therefore, it did not require payment of stamp duty.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the consent decree was not liable for stamp duty as it only asserted the pre-existing rights of the appellant. The mutation of the revenue records in respect of the subject land was ordered in favor of the appellant. The impugned order passed by the High Court was set aside, and the appeal stood allowed.

The case involves an eviction proceeding under the Delhi Development Act, 1957. The first appellant is the owner of a public premises in Delhi, and the respondents are occupying the premises without permission. The Inquiry Officer was appointed to conduct the inquiry and decide on the claims of the parties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents raised several points before the High Court, including:
- Whether the Inquiry Officer had a personal interest in the lis and therefore could not be impartial.
- Whether the State Government should be impleaded as a party in the proceedings under section 105B of the Act.
- Whether the Inquiry Officer had the competence to proceed with the inquiry in the absence of regulations having been framed under section 105H of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court framed issues on all the points raised by the respondents and ordered that they be determined by the Inquiry Officer. However, the Supreme Court observed that:
- The Inquiry Officer is an independent quasi-judicial officer under the Act and has no personal interest in the lis.
- The State Government does not need to be impleaded as a party in the proceedings.
- The absence of regulations under section 105H of the Act does not entitle the respondents to keep the proceedings in abeyance.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to frame issues and order the Inquiry Officer to determine them. The Court set aside the impugned order and allowed the civil appeals. The Inquiry Officer is directed to allow both parties to lead evidence and raise whatever points are available in defence, except to the extent determined by judicial orders previously. The Inquiry Officer is encouraged to proceed with expedition.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant filed an application for compounding of an offence under Section 276CC of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the "Act") for Assessment Year (AY) 2013-14. The Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara rejected the application, and the High Court also rejected the writ petition filed by the appellant against this order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the offence was covered by the expression "first offence" as defined under the 2014 guidelines for compounding, and therefore, the application could not have been rejected on this ground alone. The respondent argued that the rejection of the compounding application was justified.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the restrictions laid down in Paragraph 8 of the 2014 guidelines are to be generally followed but do not exclude the possibility of making an exception and allowing the compounding application in a peculiar case where the facts and circumstances so require. The court also noted that there has been a shift in policy by the Department when it comes to the compounding of offences under Section 276CC, with the offence now being classified as a Category A offence instead of a Category B offence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the High Court fell in error in rejecting the writ petition filed by the appellant against the order passed by the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara. The court set aside both the impugned orders and directed the competent authority to consider the fresh application for compounding submitted by the appellant within two weeks from the date of the judgment. If the application is accepted, the proceedings pending before the Trial Court shall stand abated; if it is rejected, the trial shall continue.

<FACTS>
The case involves a suit filed for cancellation of a Sale Deed and recovery of possession. The plaintiff seeks to cancel the sale deed on certain grounds and also claims recovery of possession of the suit property.
The suit was filed beyond the period of twelve years, which is the limitation period for such suits.
The plaintiff's original prayer was for cancellation of the sale deed, but a consequential prayer was also made for recovery of possession.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the arguments revolved around the applicability of the limitation period for the suit and the classification of the relief sought as substantive or consequential.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court treated the relief for possession as a consequential prayer and the relief for cancellation of the Sale Deed as the substantive prayer.
If a composite suit is filed for cancellation of the Sale Deed and recovery of possession, the limitation period should be considered with respect to the substantive relief of cancellation of the Sale Deed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that since the substantive prayer was for cancellation of the sale deed, which would be three years from the date of knowledge of the sale deed sought to be cancelled, the suit was barred by limitation.
Consequently, the court dismissed the suit as it was beyond the period of limitation counted from the day when the right to sue first accrued.

The petitioner, Mohd. Tahir Hussain, sought interim bail to participate in the Delhi Assembly elections. The petition was filed under Article 32 of the Constitution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's counsel argued that the Election Commission of India had notified the election schedule, and the petitioner's name was included on the voters' list. He claimed that his right to contest the election was being violated by not granting him interim bail.
The respondent's counsel argued that the petitioner was a proclaimed offender in several cases and was liable for imprisonment under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. They contended that granting interim bail would set a dangerous precedent and allow other convicts or undertrial prisoners to seek release for electoral purposes.

The court observed that the grant of interim bail was specific to this case and should not be treated as a conclusive opinion on the merits of the underlying bail application. The judges cautioned against opening a Pandora's Box by allowing a horde of convicts or undertrial prisoners to seek release for electoral purposes.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court disposed of the Special Leave Petition (Criminal) accordingly, modifying the impugned judgment pro tanto. It directed the Registry to place the papers immediately before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India due to differing opinions among the judges. The judges clarified that this judgment was passed in specific facts and circumstances and should not be cited as a precedent without examining the merits of each case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, specifically dealing with the rights of a female Hindu to property possessed by her. The case discusses various judgments and decisions that have been made regarding this section.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are based on the interpretation of Section 14(1) and (2) of the Hindu Succession Act. It is stated that the provision of Section 14(1), which allows a female Hindu to claim a higher right to property possessed by her, cannot be applied in cases where the property was received through testamentary disposition after the Act came into effect.
The arguments also highlight the importance of considering the provision of Section 14(2) and Section 30 of the Act, which provide that in case of testamentary disposition, the widow is bound by the limitation on her right and cannot claim a higher right by invoking Section 14(1).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It is observed that there are several inconsistent judgments regarding the interpretation of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act. Some decisions have followed the principle laid down in Karmi v. Smt. Mst. Lalitha, while others have deviated from it.
The observations also note that the subsequent decisions have not clearly and categorically overruled the case of Karmi and its principles, but rather followed the idea presented in it.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that there must be clarity and certainty in the interpretation of Section 14 of the Act. The registry is directed to place the order along with the appeal paper book before the Chief Justice of India for constituting an appropriate larger bench for reconciling the principles laid down in various judgments of this Court and for restating the law on the interplay between sub-section (1) and (2) of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the entitlement to property rights in a family. The first partition suit was decreed by virtue of the Punjab Pre-Emption (Repeal) Act, 1973. The parties have admitted to their entitlement to shares in the property. The case has been ongoing for more than two decades.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's objections were dismissed by the High Court, and they sought a review of the decision. They argued that the High Court erred in its observation regarding the pre-emption law and that this affected their entitlement to shares in the property. The appellant also relied on various Supreme Court judgments, including General Manager of the Raj Durbhunga v. Coomar Ramaput Sing (1871-72) 14 MIA 605:20 ER 912 and Messer Griesheim GmbH v. Goyal MG Gases Pvt Ltd. (2022) 11 SCC 549.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the entitlement of shares in the property was admitted by the parties, but it also noted that the first partition suit could not have been decreed by virtue of the Punjab Pre-Emption (Repeal) Act, 1973. However, this observation appears to be incorrect as the discussion of pre-emption in the judgment rendered in the first partition suit corresponds to an earlier transaction having taken place somewhere in the 1930s and 1940s.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court remanded the matter to the First Appellate Court to take a decision on the objections of the appellant afresh, on merits. The Court clarified that it had not expressed any view on the facts of the case. The Court also requested the concerned Court to take all steps necessary for expeditious disposal of the case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FIRSTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the second respondent, which was registered based on a first information report (FIR) dated 11.11.2010. The FIR led to an investigation and the filing of a final report. The complainant then filed a narazi petition, which was heard by the learned CJM, who ultimately rejected the complaint for not being maintainable. The second respondent then filed a protest petition on 05.05.2011, and subsequently, another complaint dated 20.07.2011, which reproduced the first complaint.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case were centered around the maintainability of the second complaint. The High Court and learned Sessions Judge interfered with the order passed by the learned CJM, holding that the second complaint was maintainable. However, this decision was challenged before the Supreme Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case highlight the importance of considering the circumstances under which a previous complaint was rejected or dismissed when determining whether to entertain a subsequent complaint. The court noted that repeated complaints by frustrated litigants cannot be maintained.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the decisions of the High Court and learned Sessions Judge, holding that the second complaint was not maintainable in law. The court restored the order of the learned CJM dated 12.07.2012, rejecting the second complaint for being non-maintainable.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal filed by the appellant, who was previously convicted and sentenced to death. The High Court acquitted the appellant and directed for a reinvestigation of the case.
The reinvestigation led to a fresh set of chargesheet and examination of witnesses.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court analyzed the conditions laid down in T.P. Gopalakrishnan (supra) to determine whether the principle of double jeopardy applies:
1. Previous proceedings before a court of law or judicial tribunal with competent jurisdiction
2. Conviction or acquittal in force at the time of second proceeding for same offence and facts
3. Subsequent proceeding must be a fresh proceeding, where appellant is prosecuted and punished again

The Supreme Court held that all three conditions are met:
- Previous proceedings were valid, and the conviction was in force.
- The acquittal by the High Court made the previous conviction null and void.
- The direction for reinvestigation implies a fresh proceeding.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations of the Supreme Court are based on the understanding that the principle of double jeopardy is enshrined in Article 20(2) of the Constitution. This right stands violated when all three conditions mentioned above are met.
The Court further notes that the High Court's vision was bad in law, and its direction for reinvestigation led to a fresh proceeding.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
- The right enshrined in Article 20(2) of the appellant stands violated.
- The appeal is allowed as the principle of double jeopardy has been breached.
- All proceedings subsequent to the High Court's direction are quashed and set aside.
- The appellant stands acquitted of all charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a contract for the sale of an immovable property between two parties. The contract stipulates that 10% of the total sale consideration has to be paid immediately, 85% by February 28th, and the balance 5% at the time of notice for possession. The possession of the suit property is to be handed over by the defendants to the plaintiff upon payment of the balance 5%. A decree of specific performance has been granted.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff argues that the transfer of possession of the immovable property is implicit in the contract and its absence would not affect the character of the suit, which falls under Section 16(d) of the CPC. The court should consider the substance or object of the suit, rather than dissecting individual prayers.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the handing over of possession is only incidental to the execution of the sale deed, in view of the interplay between Sections 22 and 28 of the Specific Relief Act and Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act. The plaintiff's suit for specific performance is not affected by the absence of a specific prayer seeking transfer of possession.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismisses the Special Leave Petitions, holding that the plaintiff must present the plaint before the court of competent jurisdiction and get his suit adjudicated on merits. The interim relief granted earlier stands vacated, and pending applications are disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the respondent and the appellant regarding the demand of customs duty and interest on 291 cases of imported goods. The appellant had warehoused the goods in a notified public bonded warehouse, but they were not cleared within the permitted period. The respondent demanded customs duty and interest on the goods under Sections 15(1)(b) and 72 of the Customs Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant include:
- The warehousing in the notified public bonded warehouse continued as evidenced by the deposit made by the Corporation to the respondent as custom establishment charges for the period from 1992-1993 to 2007-2008.
- This is not a case where Section 15(1)(b) could have been invoked, as the warehousing period had not expired or been extended.
- The decision of this Court in Kesoram is not applicable to the facts of the present case, as it dealt with a different context.

The respondent's arguments include:
- The provisions of Section 72 of the Customs Act are applicable to the goods that remained in the bonded warehouse beyond the permitted period.
- The date on which the warehousing period comes to an end is the relevant date for determining the rate of duty, and not the date when the duty is actually demanded.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the Court include:
- The warehousing in the notified public bonded warehouse continued as evidenced by the deposit made by the Corporation to the respondent as custom establishment charges for the period from 1992-1993 to 2007-2008.
- This is not a case where Section 15(1)(b) could have been invoked, as the warehousing period had not expired or been extended.
- The decision of this Court in Kesoram is not applicable to the facts of the present case, as it dealt with a different context.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the Court states that:
- The demand raised by the respondent against the appellant and affirmed by the CESTAT qua the 264 cases including levy of customs duty and interest cannot be sustained. Those are accordingly set aside and quashed.
- The parties are directed to work out their remedies in respect of the 264 cases of goods under Section 15(1)(c) of the Customs Act within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
- In so far as the demand of customs duty and interest on the 27 cases is concerned, the same is hereby sustained.
- The decision imposing penalty of rupees one lakh on the appellant under Section 112 of the Customs Act is also not disturbed in view of the conduct of the appellant in unauthorisedly removing the 27 cases of imported goods not only from the notified public bonded warehouse but also from the industrial/factory premises of the appellant.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a land acquisition process under the 1894 Land Acquisition Act. The respondents had filed objections under Section 5A of the Act, but the Collector's order and subsequent corrigendum raised suspicion about the fairness of the proceedings. The High Court had set aside the Collector's order, leading to this appeal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the land acquisition process was lawful and that the objections under Section 5A were not justified. They also contended that the corrigendum issued by the Collector did not affect the merits of the objections.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the issuance of the corrigendum was largely insignificant and did not draw adverse inference or doubt the fairness of the procedure followed for deciding the objections. The Court also noted that similar views had been taken in previous cases, such as Om Prakash v. State of U.P. and M.S.P.L. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals, setting aside the main judgment dated 05.01.2017 of the High Court and all other judgments following it. The writ petitions filed by the respondents were dismissed without any order as to costs. The compensation amount was directed to be paid to the respondents and other land-owners along with interest at the statutory rate within 4 weeks. It was clarified that since the 2013 Act came into force, the respondents and other land-owners/tenure holders are entitled to be paid compensation in accordance with Section 24(1) read with other relevant provisions of the 2013 Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUNCTONAL LAW>
This is not a case, but rather an analysis of a Supreme Court Judgment. Hence, the relevant sections are:

<FACTS>
The Appellant had filed an application for compounding of offence under Section 276CC of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the "Act") for Assessment Year (AY) 2013-14 before the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara. The application was rejected on the ground that it was not the Appellant's first offence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant argued that the rejection of the compounding application was in error as the offence under Section 276CC of the Act for the AY 2013-14 is covered by the expression "first offence" as defined under the 2014 guidelines.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the 2014 guidelines, which were applicable at the time, did not exclude the possibility of making an exception and allowing the compounding application in a peculiar case where the facts and circumstances so require. The court also noted that there has been a clear shift in the policy of the Department when it comes to the compounding of offences under Section 276CC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court as well as the order passed by the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara rejecting the compounding application of the Appellant. The court directed the Appellant to prefer a fresh application for compounding before the competent authority within two weeks from the date of the judgment and directed the same to be adjudicated by the competent authority having regard to the conduct of the Appellant, the nature of the offence, and the facts and circumstances of the case within a period of four weeks from the date on which the application is filed by the Appellant.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal by the Appellant, who is a defendant in a criminal trial. The incident occurred when the deceased, Tularam, was killed. The Investigating Officer recorded a statement from Tularam instantly, a day after the incident, which implicated the Appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that the mere non-obtainment of a medical fitness certificate should deter the Court from considering the statement as a dying declaration. However, the prosecution contended that the Investigating Officer's testimony and the corroborating injuries found during the post-mortem examination were sufficient to establish that Tularam was in a fit condition to make the statement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It is observed that the Constitution Bench in Laxman v. State of Maharashtra ruled that a dying declaration can be oral or written, and any adequate method of communication will suffice if the indication is positive and definite. Additionally, the medical opinion cannot override the affirmation by eyewitnesses that the deceased was conscious and capable of making the declaration.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that there were no contradictions or discrepancies in the prosecution case to warrant a different view than that of the Trial Court and the High Court. The Appellant's appeal was dismissed, and if he is on bail, his bail bonds are cancelled, and he is directed to surrender to undergo the remainder of the sentence. If he is already in custody, he shall complete the remainder of the sentence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against a charge framed under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The appellants, including Puneet Sabharwal, have been accused of possessing disproportionate assets. The Income Tax Department had assessed the appellants' income and found that they had acquired substantial wealth, leading to allegations of corruption.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the orders passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) should be considered as evidence in their favor. They claimed that these orders show that no case was made out against them in the income tax proceedings. Additionally, they contended that the prosecution had not provided sufficient material to frame charges against them.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the trial has been pending for nearly 25 years and directed the Trial Court to expedite the conclusion of the case on or before December 31, 2024. The court also noted that the observations made in the judgment were only relevant to the discharge proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the appeals, stating that the appellants had not made out a case to say that the charge was groundless. The court applied the principles from established judgments, such as Onkar Nath Mishra & Ors. v. State (NCT of Delhi) & Anr. and State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy & Ors., which emphasize the need for judicial consideration when determining whether material warrants the framing of charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal regarding the impleading of respondent nos. 2 and 3 as parties in an arbitration proceeding under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (ACA). The appellants had filed a notice invoking arbitration, but certain persons who are parties to the arbitration agreement were not issued such a notice. The matter was referred to the High Court of Delhi, which held that the arbitral tribunal did not have jurisdiction to implead respondent nos. 2 and 3 as parties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that a notice invoking arbitration under Section 21 of the ACA is mandatory for determining limitation periods and applicable law. However, they contended that merely because such a notice was not issued to certain persons who are parties to the arbitration agreement does not denude the arbitral tribunal of its jurisdiction to implead them as parties during the arbitral proceedings.
The appellants also argued that an application under Section 11 of the ACA is only for the court to appoint an arbitrator and does not determine the final issue of whether a person can be made a party before the arbitral tribunal. They contended that this decision is taken by the arbitral tribunal in an application under Section 16.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's judgment was set aside, and it was observed that respondent nos. 2 and 3 are parties to the arbitration agreement despite being non-signatories. Their conduct was in accordance with and in pursuance of the terms of the LLP Agreement, which led to their consent to be bound by the arbitration agreement contained in Clause 40 thereof.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court. It directed that respondent nos. 2 and 3 be impleaded as parties before the arbitral tribunal, and the proceedings must be continued from the stage of the arbitral tribunal's order dated 15.02.2024.
The Supreme Court further requested the arbitral tribunal to complete the hearings and pass its award as expeditiously as possible considering that the claim was filed in 2022.
No order was passed regarding costs, and pending applications stood disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the summoning order against accused Nos.2 and 5 in a criminal case related to alleged police misconduct during an investigation of multiple cases pending against a complainant. The proceedings were initiated by the Mahalakshmi Layout Police Station, Bengaluru, upon due consideration of the criminal cases registered against the complainant.
The order dated 23.08.1990 was passed by the Director General and Inspector General of Police (DGP) regarding the creation of a list of "erring" individuals who were subject to harassment by the police. Accused Nos.2 and 5, as well as other accused persons, were allegedly involved in these incidents.
The incident pertains to the period of 1999-2000. Accused Nos.1, 3, and 4 have since passed away. The proceedings now survive solely against accused Nos.2 and 5. Both accused No.2 and accused No.5 retired from service long ago on attaining the age of superannuation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The counsel for the accused argued that there was no sanction for prosecution in this case, which is a pre-requisite under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The absence of the necessary sanction vitiates the very initiation of criminal proceedings against the accused persons.
It was contended by the counsel for the accused that even if it were assumed that some action had been taken in excess of their authority, it would not disentitle them to the statutory protection mandated by law. A public servant is entitled to this protection as long as there exists a reasonable nexus between the act complained of and the officer's official functions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the actions attributed to the accused persons emanate from the discharge of their official duties, specifically in connection with the investigation of criminal cases pending against the complainant. A mere excess or overreach in the performance of official duty does not disentitle a public servant from the statutory protection mandated by law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the learned VII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate erred in taking cognizance of the alleged offences against the accused persons without the requisite sanction for prosecution in this case. The absence of the necessary sanction vitiates the very initiation of criminal proceedings against the accused persons.
In view of the foregoing discussion, it was considered by the court that no meaningful purpose would be served by prolonging the criminal prosecution against accused Nos.2 and 5. Accordingly, the court was satisfied that the ends of justice would be adequately met in this case by quashing the proceedings against them.
The appeal is allowed. The impugned order dated 17.03.2021 passed by the High Court in Criminal Petition No.4512 of 2020 is hereby set aside. Consequently, Criminal Petition No.4512 of 2020 stands allowed. As a result, the summoning order dated 07.05.2016 passed by the learned VII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru against accused Nos.2 and 5, as well as the order dated 11.06.2020 passed by the learned LXI City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru City in affirming the same are hereby quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants resorted to a peaceful and orderly protest without using offensive or abusive language. The criminal proceedings levelled against them were under Section 500 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' case falls within the sweep, scope, and ambit of exception 9 to Section 499. Their peaceful protest is protected by Article 19(1)(a), (b), and (c) of the Constitution of India. The criminal proceedings levelled against them, if allowed to continue, will be a clear abuse of process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The manner of the protest resorted to by the appellants was peaceful and orderly. Peaceful pamphleteering has been held to be a form of communication protected by the first amendment in the United States of America. The right to protest peacefully without falling foul of the law is a corresponding right, which the consumers ought to possess just as the seller enjoys his right to commercial speech.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated 10.06.2024 in CRWP No. 2099/2021 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay is set aside. Consequently, the complaint in CC No. 2042/SS/2016 pending on the file of the Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Borivali, Mumbai along with the order dated 04.10.2016 issuing summons to the appellants under Section 500 read with Section 34 of the IPC would stand quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the National Environmental Appellate Authority (NEAA) and its jurisdiction in environmental matters. The Tribunal had assumed jurisdiction over a matter where no substantial question relating to environment had arisen, nor was there any violation of enactments specified in Schedule-I.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The parties did not provide specific arguments in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the NEAA's jurisdiction and actions were challenged by the appellants, who argued that no substantial question relating to environment had arisen in the matter and that there was no violation of enactments specified in Schedule-I.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The "Precautionary Principle" and the "Polluter Pays Principle" are part of India's environmental law.
- While the right to clean environment is a fundamental right under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, the right to development through industrialization equally claims priority under fundamental rights, particularly under Articles 14, 19, and 21.
- There is a need for "Sustainable Development" harmonizing and striking a golden balance between the right to development and the right to clean environment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The Tribunal had committed gross error in assuming jurisdiction over the matter.
- No substantial question relating to environment had arisen, nor was there any violation of enactments specified in Schedule-I.
- The impugned Orders passed by the Tribunal were without jurisdiction and legally untenable.
- The Appeals stand allowed accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal proceeding against the appellant under Section 420 of the IPC. The appellant had been accused of cheating and was facing trial in Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court include:
* The prosecution is manifestly frivolous or vexatious
* The FIR/complaint is well-drafted with necessary pleadings to disclose the ingredients of the alleged offence
* The court owes a duty to look into the FIR closely and with care when challenged on the ground that the prosecution is frivolous or vexatious
* Vicarious liability of office bearers would arise if any provision exists in the statute, but it is obligatory for the complainant to make requisite allegations to attract such provisions
* The registration of multiple FIRs over a period assumes importance and attracts the issue of wreaking vengeance out of private or personal grudge
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed:
* Whenever an accused comes before the court invoking inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC or extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, the court owes a duty to look into the FIR with care and a little more closely
* The court should not restrict itself only to the stage of a case but is empowered to take into account the overall circumstances leading to the initiation/registration of the case as well as materials collected in the course of investigation
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
* The present case is fit for allowing the appeal and quashing the impugned criminal proceedings instituted against the appellant
* Criminal Case No. 7489 of 2002 arising out of Crime No. 13 of 1998 pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad is quashed
* The appeal is allowed
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant has undergone more than 14 years and 10 months of actual incarceration. He is seeking pre-mature release under the provision/policy in vogue at the time of his conviction, or if not, a more beneficial policy.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court considered the contention that the appellant's case be considered by the provision/policy in vogue at the time of his conviction, and if not, a more beneficial policy. The court also noted that the decision to grant or not to grant remission has to be well-informed, reasonable, and fair to all concerned.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the effect of remitting the sentence, in part or full, results in the restoration of liberty of a convict. If the order granting remission is to be cancelled or revoked, it will naturally affect the liberty of the convict.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is dismissed accordingly, subject to the observations and directions that the State Government shall pass a reasoned order expeditiously and latest within 3 months from the date of filing such representation, having regard to the position of law enunciated by the court. The original records are directed to be returned to the concerned Court(s) forthwith.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a criminal appeal (Criminal Appeal No. 1770 of 2009) under Section 19 of the TADA Act, filed by the State (CBI) against the respondents for offenses under Section 3(1) of the TADA Act read with Sections 120B, 302, 368, and 364 of the RPC.
The incident relates to the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Shri H.L. Khera, the then General Manager, HMT Watch Factory, Srinagar allegedly by the respondents after entering into a criminal conspiracy to strike terror in the minds of the general public.
The confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2) recorded by Shri A.K. Suri (PW-3 here) was rejected as it did not meet the procedural safeguards.
The investigation and trial were conducted in a manner that undermined truth and justice, both for the victims and the accused.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution case centered around the confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2) which was rejected due to non-compliance with procedural safeguards.
The respondents were acquitted by the Special Court in CBI Case No. RC 6(S)/1990 for the offenses under Section 3(1) of the TADA Act read with Sections 120B, 302, 368, and 364 of the RPC.
The state (CBI) appealed against the acquittal under Section 19 of the TADA Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The procedural safeguards for recording confessional statements were not followed in this case, which led to the rejection of the confessional statement.
The investigation and trial process was marred by irregularities and abuse of power, resulting in a denial of justice for both the victims and the accused.
The draconian provisions of the TADA Act have since been repealed, highlighting concerns about its implementation and the impact on human rights.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Special Court's decision to acquit the respondents was upheld by the appellate court, which found no error or infirmity in the view taken by the Special Court.
The confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2) was deemed inadmissible as evidence due to non-compliance with procedural safeguards.
Ultimately, the criminal appeal filed by the state (CBI) against the acquittal was dismissed for lack of merit.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the conviction of a respondent-accused for an offense against a minor female, 'V'. The trial court had convicted the accused, but the High Court acquitted him. The present appeal is filed by the prosecution seeking to set aside the acquittal and restore the judgment of conviction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the contradiction between the statement made in the FIR and the deposition in Court is not material enough to discredit the witness's statement. They also point out that the evidence of other nature, such as medical evidence, supports the prosecution case.
Additionally, they argue that the version suggested by the defense that the injury caused to 'V' could not have been caused by a nail or an all-pin is disputed and there are circumstances pointing to the respondent-accused having committed the offense against 'V'.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that cross-examination did not meet the criteria of discrediting the witness or eliciting facts favorable to the other party. The court also notes that the discrepancy between the statement made in the FIR and the deposition in Court was not put to the witness for a response.
Furthermore, the court mentions that the possibility of animosity between the accused and the father of 'V' has not been established to create reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeal, setting aside the acquittal entered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench, Jaipur. The judgment of conviction returned by the Sessions Judge, Tonk, is restored. The respondent-accused is directed to surrender before the competent authority within four weeks from the date of this judgment, to serve out the sentence as awarded by the learned Trial Court.

The Appellant, Nara Chandrababu Naidu, was implicated in various offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The Special Court passed an order remanding him in custody, and the High Court upheld this decision.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments for the Appellant:
* Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 applies only to offenses committed after its amendment by the Amendment Act, 2018.
* The Special Court lacked jurisdiction to pass a remand order under the powers conferred upon it under Sections 4 and 5 of the PC Act.

Arguments for the Respondent:
* Section 17A is applicable to all offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, including those committed prior to the amendment by the Amendment Act, 2018.
* The Special Court had jurisdiction to pass a remand order in view of the powers conferred upon it under Sections 4 and 5 of the PC Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations:
* The Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India has referred the matter to a Larger Bench for adjudication on the point of conflicting opinions expressed by the judges.
* The case highlights the importance of clear and unambiguous legislation in preventing conflicts and uncertainties in legal proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Judgment:
The Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India has referred the matter to a Larger Bench, and the appeal is dismissed without a final judgment being pronounced on the merits of the case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Entries 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The MMDR Act, 1957, which regulates the grant of mining leases, was amended in 1995 to provide for a royalty on minerals. The State Governments imposed a cess on the royalty under Entry 54 of List I. The issue at hand is whether the imposition of a cess on royalty is valid.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:

*   Whether the imposition of a cess on royalty is a tax, and thus, falls within Entries 49 or 50 of List II?
*   Whether the State Governments have the power to impose a cess on royalty under Entry 54 of List I?
*   Whether Sections 9, 9A, and 25 of the MMDR Act, 1957, denude or limit the scope of Entry 50 of List II?

These arguments are central to determining the validity of the imposition of a cess on royalty.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The Hon'ble Judge observes that:

*   The majority decision in Kesoram is a serious departure from the law laid down by the seven-judge Bench in India Cement, which was wholly unwarranted and therefore, in my view, the said majority judgment is liable to be overruled.
*   Entry 50 of List II is unique because it is the only taxation Entry in Lists I and II where the taxing power of a State legislature has been subjected to "any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development".
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Judge holds that:

*   Sections 9, 9A, and 25 of the MMDR Act, 1957, denude or limit the scope of Entry 50 of List II.
*   The majority decision in Kesoram is overruled to the extent it holds that royalty is not a tax.
*   Taxes on lands and buildings under Entry 49 of List II contemplate a tax levied directly on the land as a unit having a defined relationship with the land, and does not include mineral bearing lands within its scope.
*   The State legislature is denuded of its powers under Entry 50 of List II to the extent of the provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957.
*   Entry 50 of List II is subject to "any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development".
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) and a disgorgement order dated 28.09.2018 against VCL (a company) and others for fraudulent acts and transactions.
Ram Kishori Gupta and Harishchandra Gupta filed a compensation claim against SEBI, which was decided by the Tribunal's order dated 30.04.2013.
The SAT passed an order on 02.08.2019 in Appeal No. 44 of 2019, directing restitution to the appellants.
SEBI issued a show-cause notice proposing disgorgement and then passed an order seven months later.
Some individuals concerned have expired while most corporate entities have become defunct.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by SEBI were that the entire exercise undertaken after the passing of the final order dated 31.07.2014 was unsustainable in law, and the compensation claim of Ram Kishori Gupta and Harishchandra Gupta against SEBI stood decided by the Tribunal's order dated 30.04.2013.
The SAT argued that the direction for restitution by the Tribunal in its judgment dated 02.08.2019 in Appeal No. 44 of 2019 cannot be sustained, as it was not open to them to reopen the same and seek to pin such liability upon SEBI once again.
SEBI also contended that only 4 entities out of 22 filed appeals against the disgorgement order dated 28.09.2018, making the said order unsustainable in law.
However, VCL and other entities who were appellants before the Tribunal were held to have indulged in fraudulent acts and transactions, and their direction to pay costs of ₹2,00,000/- each was unjustified on facts.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include that SEBI's approach in dealing with the matter laid back and indolent, which does not augur well for a statutory body entrusted with protecting investors and regulating the securities market.
It is noted that some of the individuals concerned have expired while most corporate entities have become defunct.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Civil Appeal 7941 of 2019 is allowed, and the judgment dated 02.08.2019 passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai, in Appeal No. 44 of 2019 is set aside.
Civil Appeal (Diary) No. 42829 of 2019 seeking additional benefits pursuant to the aforementioned judgment dated 02.08.2019 is dismissed.
SEBI's attack against the Tribunal's judgment dated 20.12.2021 on the score that it was setting aside the disgorgement order dated 29.08.2018 is held to be devoid of merit.
However, the direction of the Tribunal mulcting SEBI with exorbitant costs payable to the appellants is unsustainable and set aside.
Civil Appeal Nos.1649-1652 of 2022 are allowed to that extent.
Parties shall bear their own costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court had earlier quashed the FIR No.6/2022 and all further proceedings pursuant thereto solely on the ground that the accused and the complainant had settled the matter.
The case involved an incident where a teacher allegedly made unwanted advances towards a higher secondary school student, which falls under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
The FIR was lodged by the father of the victim on January 8, 2022.
The accused and the complainant had compromised the case within a couple of weeks.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court's decision to quash the proceedings solely on the ground of compromise was challenged in this appeal.
It was argued that the power under Section 482, Cr. P.C. cannot be used to quash proceedings based on compromise if it is in respect of heinous offences which are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society.
The accused's actions were described as heinous and had a serious impact on the society, making it not fit for being termed as a purely private offence.
The fact that the accused and the complainant had settled the matter was not sufficient to abruptly terminate the investigation by quashing FIR and all further proceedings pursuant thereto.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The object and purpose of enacting the POCSO Act were taken into consideration while making the judgment.
The High Court's reliance on Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2013) 5 SCC 257 was noted, but it was pointed out that this case does not allow for quashing of proceedings based solely on compromise in cases involving heinous offences.
It was observed that allowing such compromises could send a signal to others committing similar offences that anything and everything can be compromised.
The need for deterrence and the importance of protecting children from sexual abuse were emphasized.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal is allowed. The impugned order dated 04.02.2022 of the High Court in S.B.C.R.M.P. No.1348/2022 is hereby quashed and set aside.
The FIR No.6/2022, investigation, and criminal proceedings pursuant thereto subject to the nature of the report to be filed under Section 173(2), Cr. P.C., be proceeded with against the accused in accordance with law.
It was made clear that no observations were made on the merits of the case.
Appreciation and gratitude were expressed for the invaluable assistance provided by Mr. R. Basant, learned Senior Counsel as amicus curiae, ably assisted by Mr. Aviral Saxena, Advocate on Record.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FUN FACTS>
The case revolves around the invocation of powers by a Magistrate under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. and the requirement for an affidavit to be submitted along with the complaint.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of requiring an affidavit:
- To curb misuse of powers by unscrupulous litigants
- To ensure that applications are made after considering submissions from concerned police officers
- Prior applications under Sections 154(1) and 154(3) must be filed before proceeding with Section 156(3)

Arguments against requiring an affidavit (not explicitly mentioned):
Information not available

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations by the court:
- Applications under Section 156(3) are often filed in a routine manner without taking responsibility
- Persons making applications should be conscious and not make false affidavits
- Requiring an affidavit would deter persons from casually invoking authority of the Magistrate
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Judgment:
The appeal succeeds, and the impugned order is set aside. The order passed by the Magistrate directing police investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. is also set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the District Town Planner, who carried out a demolition of a construction put up by the first respondent within the scope and ambit of her authority. The demolition was done under the orders of superior officers, and there was sufficient basis for doing so.
The first respondent had filed an application seeking regularisation of the construction put up, but this did not prevent the demolition from being carried out.
A criminal complaint was lodged against the District Town Planner, who then moved to quash the summoning order under Section 482 CrPC.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the appellant (District Town Planner) include:
- The demolition was carried out within the scope and ambit of her authority as District Town Planner in Enforcement Division.
- The act of demolition had a correlation with the discharge of official duties, and it was carried out during the course of performance of her official duties.
The arguments presented by the respondent (first respondent) include:
- Even if an application for regularisation was pending, the appellant had no authority to demolish the construction put up.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observed that:
- The first respondent ought to have sought sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of the CrPC in this case.
- Since no prior order of sanction was passed under Section 197 of the CrPC, the initiation of the complaint itself is non est (not valid).
</Observations>

<Judgment>
The court's judgment includes:
- The summoning order and consequent steps taken by the Trial Court are liable to be quashed.
- The appeals are allowed, and disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
- Liberty is reserved for the first respondent to take steps in accordance with law and seek an order of sanction.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioner, a former Judge of the High Court, retired on 26 August 2002. The petitioner had held judicial office for at least ten years and was also a member of the Bar for over fourteen years and eight months prior to his appointment as a Judge of the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's pensionary payments were not computed with the benefit of an addition of ten years of service, despite qualifying under Article 217(2)(a) of the Constitution. The petitioner relied on the judgment of this Court in Union of India vs Justice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg, which held that a Judge appointed from the district judiciary should be treated similarly to one appointed from the Bar.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the principle enunciated in Union of India vs Justice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg was applicable to the present case. The Court also noted that the petitioner's pensionary payments were not computed with the benefit of an addition of ten years of service, despite qualifying under Article 217(2)(a).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court directed that the pensionary payments due to the petitioner be recomputed after giving him the benefit of an addition of ten years of service. The maximum basic pension payable to a Judge of the High Court (Rs 13,50,000 per annum) would continue to apply to the petitioner. The difference in pensionary payments was to be computed with effect from the date of retirement within a period of three months, and the arrears due and payable in terms of the present order were to be paid over by 31 March 2025.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the imposition of penalty on liquor traders under Rule 19 of the Prohibition and Excise Rules, 1990. The appellants challenged the order of the High Court which had upheld the imposition of penalty at four times the duty as per the old law.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The single Judge was of the view that the amendment by way of substitution has the effect of repealing the law which existed as on the date of repeal. However, this approach is limited and not correct.
On the other hand, the Division Bench held that levy of penalty is substantive law, and as such, it cannot operate retrospectively. This approach is also incorrect.
The appellants argued that the substituted penalty only mollifies the rigour of the law by reducing the penalty from four times the duty to value of the duty. Therefore, the bar of Article 20(1) of imposing a penalty greater than the one in force at the time of the commission of the offence has no application.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that both the single Judge and Division Bench had adopted incorrect approaches to the issue. The court emphasized the importance of understanding laws and their processes with simplicity and clarity, keeping in mind the purpose and object for which they seek to govern and regulate us.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court. It held that the penalty to be imposed on the appellants will be on the basis of Rule 19 as substituted on 29.03.2011. The court further stated that there shall be no order as to costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a double murder charge against four accused individuals, Waseem, Nazim, Aslam, and Abubakar. The case has been pending trial for several years.
A cross-FIR was filed by Smt. Saeeda Begum, the mother of Waseem, at the instance of the accused persons. A closure report was filed by the police in the cross-FIR.
The respondents have been in custody for less than three years for such a serious offence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants and the State of UP argued that the respondents do not deserve the concession of bail due to the following factors:
* The respondents have been in custody for less than three years for such a serious offence of a double murder.
* A cross-FIR was filed by Smt. Saeeda Begum, which was later found to be based on false affidavits.
* The police had filed a closure report in the cross-FIR.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made above are limited to examining the infirmities in the impugned orders and shall not be treated as an opinion on the merits of the matter which is still pending trial.
In the event of any new circumstances emerging, the respondents shall be entitled to apply for bail at a later stage.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court quashed and set aside all the four impugned orders granting bail to the respondents. The respondents are directed to surrender within two weeks from the date of passing of this order.
It is clarified that the observations made above shall not be treated as an opinion on the merits of the matter which is still pending trial.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the State Financial Corporations' right to recover loans under various Acts, including the Haryana Revenue Recovery Act and the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. The court is considering whether these Acts confer an additional right to recover amounts due, separate from civil remedies such as filing a suit.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The State Financial Corporations' contention that their Acts confer an additional right to recover amounts due, independent of civil remedies.
* The debtor's argument that the statute of limitations bars recovery of time-barred dues.
* The court's consideration of previous judgments, including V.R. Kalliyanikutty v. Kerala State Electricity Board and Deep Chand v. State of Uttar Pradesh.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes the following observations:

* The object of various Acts is to enable speedy recovery of money.
* The classification of laws in this regard is valid.
* The existence of a right to refund under protest does not determine the issue at hand.
* The statute of limitations only bars a remedy, while the right to recover remains untouched.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is as follows:

* The matter needs to be placed before an appropriate three-judge bench for comprehensive consideration and an authoritative pronouncement.
* The papers along with this order are to be placed before Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for seeking directions in this regard.

Note: There is no final judgment on the merits of the case, but rather a decision to refer it to a larger bench.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the reporting conditions imposed by a state on an individual or entity. The court is required to determine whether these conditions are mandatory or directory, and if they are directory, whether their non-compliance can be cured.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the reporting conditions are directory in nature and that their non-compliance does not vitiate the proceedings. They relied on various case laws to support their contention.
On the other hand, the state contended that the reporting conditions are mandatory and that their non-compliance is a serious irregularity that can be cured only by condoning it under certain circumstances.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the question of whether reporting conditions are mandatory or directory has been subject to varying interpretations in different cases. It noted that while some courts have held that these conditions are directory, others have taken a more stringent view and considered them to be mandatory.
The court also observed that the non-compliance with reporting conditions can lead to serious consequences, including the setting aside of proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately held that the reporting conditions are directory in nature. It relied on several case laws to support its decision and noted that the non-compliance with these conditions does not vitiate the proceedings.
The court also observed that if the parties fail to comply with the reporting conditions, it is always open to the court to condone their default under certain circumstances.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a SEZ developer who is seeking to obtain the status of a deemed distribution licensee under the Electricity Act, 2003. The developer has already been granted this status by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) and the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC). However, the TSERC directed the developer to infuse an additional capital of Rs. 26.90 crore as a condition for maintaining its deemed licensee status.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context and the court's decision, it can be inferred that the TSERC argued in favor of imposing the additional capital condition, while the developer contested this requirement.
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the status of a deemed distribution licensee cannot hinge on compliance with Rule 3(2) of the 2005 Rules read with Regulation 12 of the 2013 Regulations. The language of Regulation 12 is also examined, which suggests that it imposes obligations only on regular applicants who come within the purview of Regulations 4 to 11.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the TSERC's direction to infuse an additional capital of Rs. 26.90 crore was not justified and contrary to the statutory scheme. The judgments and orders of the TSERC and the APTEL were set aside to this extent. However, the order granting the status of a deemed licensee to the appellant was modified to exclude the condition of infusing additional capital.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of an appellant for a charged offense, resulting in capital punishment. The trial lasted 2.3 years with 74 postings and 52 adjournments due to non-production of witnesses.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the defense argued against the conviction due to procedural irregularities and lack of compliance with international law principles.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The prosecution's approach was described as "lackadaisical" by the judges, with multiple adjournments without explanation. The examination of witnesses was not conducted efficiently, leading to a prolonged trial process. The importance of complying with procedural rigors and international law principles was emphasized.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the judgments of the Trial Court and High Court, allowing the appeals. The case was remanded to the Trial Court for fresh proceedings, with directions for expediting the trial on a day-to-day basis. The court also requested that judgment be delivered within a period of one year.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 and its applicability to policies of insurance. The appellant, a company, had purchased India Insurance Stamps for execution of insurance policies within the state of Rajasthan. However, due to unavailability of stamps within the state, it was unable to purchase the stamps and pay the stamp duty to the Rajasthan government.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant are as follows:

* The Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaption) Act, 1952 applies to the present case.
* The state legislature has legislative competence to impose and collect stamp duty on policies of insurance under Entry 44 of List III.
* The rate prescribed by the Parliament under Entry 91 of List I is applicable for collection of stamp duty.
* In the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant was bound to purchase India Insurance Stamps and pay the stamp duty to the state of Rajasthan.

The High Court had also argued that the payment of stamp duty could have been made in cash as per Section 3A of the 1952 Act. However, this argument was rejected by the court, citing sub-section (4) of the same section which excludes instruments under Entry 91, List I from the application of Section 3A.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The state government shall not demand and collect stamp duty as per the orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004.
* In conclusion, the court upheld the power and jurisdiction of the state to levy and collect stamp duty on insurance policies, but directed that it shall not be demanded or collected as per the specified orders.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The appeals are dismissed and the judgment of the High Court dated 21.02.2011 in D.B. Civil Special Appeal (Writ) No. 670 of 2004, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3418 of 2006, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3419 of 2006, D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 3420 of 2006 and D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 8187 of 2004 is affirmed.
* The State Government shall not demand and collect stamp duty as per the orders dated 16.09.2004, 16.10.2004, 11.10.2004, 01.11.2004, and 28.10.2004.

<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint conveyed by the District Magistrate, Ramban to the Special Judge, NIA on 20.09.2019. The investigation was completed with the filing of the chargesheet on 25.09.2019. However, there was an omission to obtain the required sanction or empowerment under Section 196-A of the CrPC, 1989. The appointed day for the Act, 2019 was 31.10.2019.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that there is no need to get the appropriate sanction or empowerment as mandated under Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 since the Act, 2019 came into existence on 31.10.2019. The respondent countered that the CrPC, 1973 cannot be applied retrospectively, and the investigating agency must comply with the requirement of authorization or empowerment for conveying a complaint at the conclusion of investigation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court of Calcutta's reasoning in Nibaran Chandra (supra) was adopted by the court. The court held that the requirement of an authorization or empowerment is mandatory for conveying a complaint and cannot be ignored by applying CrPC, 1973 retrospectively.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed in part. The judgment of the Special Judge, NIA, is set aside insofar as it confirms not taking cognizance for the offence punishable under Section 120-B of the RPC, 1989. Liberty is given to the appellant to comply with the mandate of Section 196-A of the CrPC, 1989 by seeking appropriate authorization or empowerment. If such compliance is made, then the Trial Court shall undertake the exercise of taking cognizance and proceed further with the trial.

<FACTS>
The case involves appeals related to the grant of anticipatory bail. The accused shown in the complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA were not arrested by the ED till the complaint was filed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued for the grant of anticipatory bail, and their counsel made submissions on their behalf. However, the details of these arguments are not explicitly mentioned in the given text.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that after cognizance is taken of the offence punishable under Section 4 of the PMLA based on a complaint under Section 44 (1)(b), the ED and its officers are powerless to exercise power under Section 19 to arrest a person shown as an accused in the complaint.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, setting aside the impugned orders declining to grant anticipatory bail. The court directed that warrants issued by the Special Courts against the appellants shall stand cancelled subject to certain conditions:
* The appellants shall appear before the concerned Special Court within one month from today and file an undertaking that they shall regularly and punctually appear before the Special Court on the dates fixed unless their appearance is specifically exempted.
* The appellants shall furnish bonds in accordance with Section 88 of the CrPC to the satisfaction of the Special Court within one month from today.
The court clarified that the warrants issued against the appellants shall be cancelled only if they make compliance as aforesaid within one month from today. To enable them to do so, the warrants shall not be executed against them for a period of one month from today.

<Facts>
The case involves an application seeking leave to file a replication in an election petition. The returned candidate had submitted a written statement, and the election petitioner sought to reply to new facts stated by the returned candidate. The High Court was asked to grant leave to file a replication.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented are:

* The returned candidate had stated new facts in his written statement that required a reply from the election petitioner.
* The election petitioner's application for leave to file a replication was justified, as it only sought to meet the explanation provided by the returned candidate and did not seek to incorporate any new material facts or cause of action.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made are:

* The non-disclosure of bank accounts alleged in the election petition was explained by the returned candidate in his written statement, and the replication only sought to meet that explanation.
* The reply in the written statement for other material facts pleaded in the election petition was dealt with by way of explanation in the replication.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered is:

* The High Court held that leave to file a replication was justified and well within its discretionary jurisdiction.
* The appeal was dismissed, and there was no order as to costs.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of the High Court granting bail to six accused persons under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The appellants are represented by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The respondents have been charged with various offenses under the UAPA.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the NIA include that there is sufficient material to show the prima facie involvement of the accused persons in the alleged offenses. They also highlighted the seriousness and gravity of the alleged offenses, as well as the previous criminal history of the respondents. The NIA argued that the High Court's order granting bail was illegal and perverse.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that it is a settled principle that this Court should be slow in interfering with an order when bail has been granted by the High Court, but if such an order is found to be illegal and perverse, it must be set aside. The court also noted that National security is always of paramount importance, and any act in aid to any terrorist act - violent or non-violent is liable to be restricted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's order granting bail was set aside by the court. The respondents were directed to surrender themselves before the NIA. It was also directed that the Special Court shall proceed with the trial as expeditiously as possible and in accordance with law, without being influenced by any of the observations made by this Court in this order.

<Facts>
The Uttar Pradesh Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 was invoked against the appellants. A FIR (Crime No.0092/2023) was registered under this Act. The complainant(s)/informant(s) in three CCs had resorted to their remedies under criminal law. A fourth CC, as informed by learned counsel for R5, also stands lodged against the appellants. There is no mention of any instance, post-registration of the said CCs, of the appellants implementing/acting on the alleged threats.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent was granted bail in a case registered under sections 364, 302, 201 & 34 of IPC and under sections 302, 120B and 34 of IPC. The respondent is also accused in another case being investigated by NIA. However, the respondent has been acquitted in one of the cases, enlarged on bail in two other cases, and granted anticipatory bail in a fourth case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant-State contended that the order granting bail should be set aside as the respondent is involved in three other cases. The Additional Solicitor General argued that the respondent's involvement in multiple cases justifies setting aside the bail order. On the other hand, the respondent's counsel argued that the respondent has been acquitted or enlarged on bail in all the mentioned cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The prosecution would be at liberty to seek cancellation of the bail if any conditions are violated by the respondent. The jurisdictional court should consider such applications independently and without being influenced by earlier observations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is dismissed, and it is held that interference is not warranted in this case. The High Court's order granting bail to the respondent is upheld.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals filed by the decree holders against the judgments of the High Court in execution proceedings. The court had allowed the petitions under Order 21, Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure and had set aside the orders passed by the executing courts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the case analysis. However, it can be inferred that the decree holders were seeking to enforce their rights as decree holders and obtain possession of the suit property.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was a delay in the disposal of execution proceedings, which is a serious issue affecting the administration of justice. The court emphasized the importance of disposing of execution proceedings within six months from the date of filing as mandated by law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgments of the High Court. The executing courts were directed to ensure that vacant and peaceful possession of the suit property is handed over to the decree holders within a period of two months from today. The court also directed all the High Courts across the country to call for information regarding the pendency of execution petitions and issue administrative orders to ensure compliance with the six-month deadline.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a writ petition filed by two female judicial officers, Sarita Chaudhary and Aditi Kumar Sharma. They were terminated from their service by the State Government and the High Court. The petitioners claimed that they were subjected to indirect discrimination due to their gender and health conditions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners' arguments included:

*   The termination orders were arbitrary and violated the principles of natural justice.
*   The State Government and the High Court failed to consider the petitioners' claims of insubordination and acute medical and emotional conditions.
*   The downgrading of Aditi Kumar Sharma's ACR without considering her health issues was discriminatory.
*   The respondents' actions reflected an "insidious patriarchal system" that perpetuated indirect discrimination against women in public employment.

The respondents' arguments included:

*   The termination orders were valid and based on the petitioners' performance.
*   The State Government and the High Court followed due process and considered the petitioners' claims before taking action.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:

*   The growing number of female judicial officers is not enough to ensure their sensitive treatment in the workplace.
*   The respondents' actions demonstrated a lack of consideration for the petitioners' health conditions and gender.
*   The case highlighted the need for rebuilding societal and legal structures to achieve equal opportunity in public employment and gender equality.

The court also noted that:

*   Gender is not a rescue for poor performance, but it must be considered as a critical factor in holistic decision-making at certain times.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court set aside the termination orders and reinstated the petitioners with all consequential benefits. The respondents were directed to declare their probation as on the date their juniors were confirmed. The petitioners shall not be entitled to any salary from the date of termination till their reinstatement, but monetary benefits for that period will be calculated notionally for pensionary benefits etc. The complaints kept in abeyance by orders of the Chief Justice due to the termination may be dealt with in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the seizure and recovery of illicit material from accused persons. The police are required to follow a procedure laid down in Section 52A of the NDPS Act, which includes documenting the recovery of the substance, its quantity, and other relevant details.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court is required to consider whether the prosecution has proven the seizure and recovery of the illicit material beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense argues that there was non-compliance with the procedure laid down in Section 52A, which may affect the admissibility of the evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that non-compliance or delayed compliance with the said provision or rules under Section 52A of the NDPS Act may lead to an adverse inference against the prosecution. However, no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to when such an inference may be drawn.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that the initial burden lies on the accused to first lay the foundational facts to show that there was non-compliance of Section 52A, either by leading evidence of its own or by relying upon the evidence of the prosecution. The standard required would only be preponderance of probabilities.
Once the foundational facts laid indicate non-compliance of Section 52A of the NDPS Act, the onus would thereafter be on the prosecution to prove by cogent evidence that either (i) there was substantial compliance with the mandate of Section 52A of the NDPS Act OR (ii) satisfy the court that such non-compliance does not affect its case against the accused.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case pertains to the interpretation of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The provisions mentioned in the Act are Section 14(3), which provides for a preliminary assessment under Section 15, and Section 7(4), which deals with the exercise of revisional jurisdiction by the High Court. The case also involves an appeal against an order of the Board passed under Section 15 of the Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the provision of Section 14(3) is mandatory and cannot be extended, as it creates a limitation on the power of the Chief Judicial Magistrate or Metropolitan Magistrate to extend the period for completion of the preliminary assessment. They also contended that the words "Children's Court" and "Court of Sessions" in the Act should not be read interchangeably.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the provision of Section 14(3) is directory, not mandatory, and can be extended for reasons to be recorded in writing. The court also noted that the jurisdiction vests primarily with the Children's Court but can be exercised by the Court of Sessions in its absence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the provision of Section 14(3) is directory and not mandatory. It also held that the words "Children's Court" and "Court of Sessions" should be read interchangeably, with jurisdiction primarily vesting in the Children's Court but exercisable by the Court of Sessions in its absence. The court directed that appeal against an order passed under Section 15 of the Act can be filed within a period of 30 days, and if sufficient cause is shown, the appellate court can entertain the appeal after the expiry of this period.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves land acquisition by the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Authority (YEIA) for the construction of the Yamuna Expressway. The acquisition was made under Sections 17(1) and 17(4) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. A total of 12,868 landowners were affected by the acquisition. The landowners challenged the acquisition in various courts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the landowners were that the invocation of the urgency clause under Sections 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act was illegal. They also argued that they should be entitled to better compensation for their lands.
The YEIA, on the other hand, argued that the acquisition was necessary for the construction of the Yamuna Expressway and that the invocation of the urgency clause was justified.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It is observed that the majority of landowners (12,728 out of 12,868) accepted the escalated compensation granted by the High Court in Kamal Sharma. The Court also noted that in previous cases such as Savitri Devi v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Sahara India Commercial Corporation Limited and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh, despite holding the invocation of the urgency clause to be illegal, the acquisition proceedings were upheld and compensation was enhanced.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the action of the State in invoking the urgency clause was in consonance with the law. The Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court's decision in Kamal Sharma was approved, which had granted an additional 64.7% compensation to the landowners as a "No Litigation Bonus". This enhancement in compensation was directed to apply uniformly to all affected landowners.
The appeals filed by the landowners were dismissed, and the appeals filed by YEIA were allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the limitation period for filing a second suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell. The plaintiff had filed the first suit in 1993, which was rejected on January 12, 1998. The plaintiff could have filed the second suit within two years from the date of rejection, but it was filed belatedly in 2007.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff argued that the limitation period for filing the second suit should be calculated from the date of rejection of the first plaint (January 12, 1998), and since the limitation period is two years under Article 113 of the Limitation Act, the second suit was filed within time.
The defendants argued that the limitation period started running from the date of dismissal of the first suit, which was earlier than January 12, 1998, making the plaintiff's claim barred by limitation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that once the limitation period starts running, it will run continuously unless there is an interruption or suspension. The filing of a previous suit can be considered as an interruption to the running of time for the purpose of that action only.
The court also noted that the plaintiff had filed the second suit belatedly in 2007, more than six years after the limitation period expired in January 2001.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the second suit was barred by limitation under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), read with Article 113 of the Limitation Act. The court observed that the cause of action had faded and paled into oblivion, and the right to sue stood extinguished.
The court allowed the application filed under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the CPC and rejected the plaint in O.S No. 49/2007.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The CMJ University failed to follow the procedure prescribed under Section 14(1) of the Act for appointing the Chancellor. The university's appointment of the Chancellor was consequently deemed invalid and void ab initio. The State Government issued a dissolution order dated March 31, 2014, which dissolved the CMJ University.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the procedure prescribed under Section 14(1) for appointing the Chancellor was not followed by the university, making the appointment invalid. They also argued against the dissolution order issued by the State Government.

The respondents (State Government) argued in support of the dissolution order, stating that it was passed with strict adherence to the procedural requirements outlined under Section 48 of the Act and in compliance with the directions issued by the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Division Bench of the High Court had approved the procedure adopted by the State Government in passing the dissolution order. The exercise of remanding the matter to the Single Judge would be an empty formality.

Judicial review lies against a decision-making process, not against the decision itself. Once the Division Bench had approved the procedure, the remand would be legally flawed and untenable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

1. The procedure prescribed under Section 14(1) of the Act for the appointment of the Chancellor was not duly followed by the CMJ University, making the appointment non est and void ab initio.

2. The dissolution order dated March 31, 2014, has been passed with strict adherence to the procedural requirements outlined under Section 48 of the Act and in compliance with the directions issued by this Court.

3. The Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in remanding the matter to the learned Single Judge for reconsideration on merits.

4. The decision of the State Government dated March 31, 2014, in dissolving the CMJ University is affirmed.

Civil Appeal No. 9694 of 2024 filed by the appellants is dismissed. Conversely, Civil Appeal No. 9695 of 2024, filed by the State, is allowed and the direction given by the Division Bench to remand the matter to the Single Bench is set aside.

- Inefficiencies in the examination process for advocates-on-record.
- Bottlenecks in filing registration and verification of cases, leading to delayed listings.
</FACTS>

<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Section 154(1) of the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation, which deals with the jurisdiction of civil courts to try suits based on title to property. The High Court had passed an order dismissing a suit for declaration of right, title, and interest in immovable property. The appellants challenged this order, arguing that the civil court has the jurisdiction to decide such matters.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the appellants was that Section 154(1) does not preclude civil courts from adjudicating upon the right to an asset when entitlement is claimed. They relied on several precedents, including Ka Trily Tariang v. U. Resdrikson Lyngdoh and Ors., Dinesh Chandra Sarkar v. Harendra Biswas, and others, which held that declaration of title to immovable property is out of bounds for the Revenue court but can be decided by a civil court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Gauhati High Court had previously clarified that the bar created by Section 154(1) does not preclude suits based on title to the property from being within the jurisdiction of civil courts. This observation was made in several decisions, including Daulatram Lakhani v. State of Assam and Ors., Gauri Shankar Agarwalla v. Madanlal Agarwalla and Ors.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court, holding that it was not sustainable in law. The order dated 16.05.2014 passed by the Civil Judge, Nagaon, was restored.

The buyer instituted a suit against the sellers, claiming that they had failed to deliver the property as per the agreement. The Trial Court ruled in favor of the buyers, but the first appellate judgment was set aside by the High Court, and the decree of the Trial Court was also set aside.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The buyer's counsel argued that the sellers had failed to deliver the property, despite being ready and willing to take possession. The seller's counsel contended that the agreement was not true, valid, and enforceable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the buyers were "ready and willing" to take possession of the property but the sellers failed to deliver it. The court also noted that no issue as to maintainability of the suit had been framed in course of proceedings before the Trial Court, despite an issue being raised regarding the agreement's validity.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, set aside the first appellate judgment and decree of the High Court, and restored that of the Trial Court. The buyer's suit was dismissed, but they were entitled to return of the advance sum of Rs.25 lakh by the sellers. If not already returned, the sellers were required to take steps in this behalf within a month from date.

The case involves a civil appeal regarding the recruitment process for 104 Constables in the AFPF. The respondents had initially cleared the selection process but were later removed from the list due to certain reasons. The appellants, who were among those selected, challenged the decision of the respondent authorities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellants include:
* The respondents do not have an indefeasible or vested right of appointment and therefore can question any decision adverse to their interest affecting achievement of their goals to secure public employment.
* The decision to cancel the select list was arbitrary and lacked sufficient justification.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* There were materials providing sufficient justification for the successor Government to cancel the select list.
* The rules for recruitment had not been uniformly applied, leading to allegations of bias or arbitrariness.
* A fresh advertisement should be published and the selection process taken forward in accordance with law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately ruled:
* Quashing the impugned judgment(s) and order(s) of the High Court.
* The civil appeal stands allowed, without order for costs.
* The appellants are granted liberty to take forward the process of filling up 104 Constables in the AFPF by publishing fresh advertisement.

The case revolves around the appointment of Assistant Professors in universities and colleges under the UGC regulations. Respondent 1, Brahma Deo, challenged the selection process for Assistant Professor positions at Delhi University, claiming that her qualifications and experience were overlooked due to a perceived "anomaly" in the marking system.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the UGC regulations required a minimum of three years' teaching experience, but the respondent's five-year experience was not considered. The petitioner also claimed that the respondent's qualifications were superior to those of other shortlisted candidates.
The respondents argued that the UGC regulations allowed for marks to be awarded for teaching and post-doctoral experience. They claimed that the respondent's experience and qualifications were adequately reflected in the selection process.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the UGC regulations clearly stated that rendering past services was not a sine qua non for direct recruitment. The court also noted that the respondent's experience and qualifications were adequately reflected in the selection process.
The court further observed that the Division Bench erred in appreciating the contentious issues in the proper perspective vis-à-vis the law applicable thereto and returned findings which are not only unwarranted but are wholly unacceptable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court set aside the impugned order, holding it unsustainable in law. The writ petition of Respondent 1 was dismissed, as were her special appeal and review petition. The appeals filed by Brahma Deo also stand allowed.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the plaintiffs and the Corporation over compensation for the shortfall in land area. The original final plot was admeasuring 3890 sq. yds., but the plaintiffs were allotted a final plot of only 2724 sq. yds. in the second varied scheme, resulting in a shortfall of 1166 sq. yds.
The Town Planning Officer estimated the compensation to be paid to the owner for the shortfall area at ₹25/- per sq. mt., which is relatable to the power under Section 52(3)(x) of the Town Planning Scheme. However, this decision was amenable to appellate review under Section 54, but the plaintiffs did not avail of this remedy.
The plaintiffs' main prayer in their suit was for quantified compensation, which they had calculated on the strength of the area of Final Plot No. 463, but their prayer in the alternative was for allotment of an extent of land equivalent to the shortfall area of Final Plot No. 463.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to compensation for the shortfall in land area and that the Corporation had failed to provide them with a final plot that was commensurate with the original final plot. They also claimed that the Town Planning Officer's decision on compensation was arbitrary and did not take into account the actual loss suffered by them.
The Corporation, on the other hand, argued that the plaintiffs were not entitled to any compensation for the shortfall in land area, as there was no guarantee that a plot owner who surrendered his land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would be allotted any land after reconstitution of the plots. The Corporation also contended that the plaintiffs had failed to produce evidence in support of their claim for quantified damages.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that there was no guarantee that a plot owner who surrendered his land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would be allotted any land after reconstitution of the plots. The court also noted that the plaintiffs had failed to produce evidence in support of their claim for quantified damages.
The court further observed that the plaintiffs' prayer for allotment of an extent of land equivalent to the shortfall area may not have been logical, as the values of the two final plots (Final Plot No. 463 and Final Plot No. 187) may not necessarily be commensurate or comparable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court allowed the first appeal filed by the Corporation and non-suiting the plaintiffs in entirety. The court held that the impugned judgment did not brook interference on any count. The appeals were, therefore, bereft of merit and were accordingly dismissed.
In the circumstances, parties shall bear their respective costs.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judgment highlights several key observations:
- The importance of proper documentation and communication between courts in ensuring timely execution of death sentences.
- The need for Sessions Courts to follow specific guidelines, including issuing notice to the State Public Prosecutor or investigating agency regarding any pending appeals or petitions.
- The requirement that convicts be provided with a gap of 15 clear days between receiving the warrant and actual execution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment emphasizes the need for adherence to established procedures in handling death penalty cases. It outlines specific directives for Sessions Courts, including listing disposed-off cases regularly after intervals of one month to ascertain the status of pending petitions. The court also stresses the importance of notice being issued to convicts before warrants are executed and that they be provided with legal aid if desired.

Key points from the judgment include:
- Issuance of a warrant for execution of death sentence should only occur once all proceedings have culminated.
- A gap of 15 clear days must exist between receipt of warrant by convict and actual execution date.
- Prison authorities are responsible for explaining implications to convicts and providing legal aid if requested.

The judgment is a comprehensive directive aimed at ensuring that the process surrounding the implementation of death penalty in India is fair, transparent, and adheres to established guidelines.

<FACTS>
The case involves the validity of an order dated 4th December, 2023, issued by the Superintendent of Police under Section 17 of the PC Act. The High Court had set aside the FIR in Crime No. 56 of 2003 pending before the 23rd Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bangalore City. The appeal was filed against this order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant include:
* The preliminary inquiry is not mandatory in every case under the PC Act if a superior officer is in possession of a source information report that prima facie discloses the commission of a cognizable offence.
* Section 17 of the PC Act relates specifically to the investigation process and does not impede the fundamental duty of the law enforcement agency to record and register an FIR for cognizable offences.
* The Superintendent of Police is competent to direct the registration of an FIR if he has information about the commission of a cognizable offence, punishable under the PC Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court was found to have erred in imposing unwarranted administrative frameworks that could potentially incapacitate law enforcement agencies. The Superintendent of Police's authority to issue a composite order directing registration of the FIR and authorizing an officer to conduct an investigation is valid under the law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the judgment and order dated 4th March, 2024 passed by the High Court of Karnataka in Criminal Writ Petition No. 13460 of 2023, and restored the FIR in Crime No. 56 of 2003 pending before the 23rd Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bangalore City.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around an arbitral award granted in favor of DAMEPL, a public utility company. The High Court Division Bench set aside the arbitral award on grounds of perversity and patent illegality under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. However, this decision was later reversed by a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that DAMEPL's counsel argued in favor of upholding the arbitral award, while the High Court Division Bench's decision was based on the grounds of perversity and patent illegality.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The court noted that the two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court interfered with the judgment of the Division Bench without justifying its interference under Article 136 of the Constitution.
* The court observed that this interference resulted in restoring a patently illegal award, causing a grave miscarriage of justice.
* The court emphasized that the curative jurisdiction should not be used as a matter of ordinary course and should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances where there is a grave miscarriage of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Supreme Court was to allow the Curative Petitions, restore the parties to their original position, discontinue the execution proceedings before the High Court for enforcing the arbitral award, refund the amounts deposited by DAMEPL, and set aside the orders passed by the High Court in the course of the execution proceedings.

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments for and against the use of EVMs are presented:

* Against EVMs:
	+ Doubts about the accuracy and reliability of EVMs
	+ Potential for tampering or manipulation
	+ Lack of transparency in the voting process
* For EVMs:
	+ Efficiency and speed of the voting process
	+ Reduced paper usage and environmental impact
	+ Improved security measures to prevent tampering

It is noted that similar issues have been raised before, but substantial evidence is needed to validate concerns about the public good.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations on the use of EVMs:

* The court notes that the system has been in place for some time and that previous cases have not conclusively settled the issue
* The importance of maintaining a balanced perspective when evaluating systems or institutions is emphasized
* The need for evidence-based decision-making to ensure the credibility and effectiveness of the electoral system is highlighted
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes:

* That the current system will have to persist with enhancements unless substantial evidence is presented against EVMs
* That regressive measures, such as reverting to paper ballots or alternative systems that do not adequately safeguard citizens' interests, are to be eschewed

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the prosecution of three individuals, Satyendar Kumar Jain, Ankush Jain, and Vaibhav Jain, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). They were arrested in connection with a money laundering case. The chargesheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) alleged that they had laundered funds worth Rs. 5,000 crores.
The respondents had made false declarations under the Income Disclosure Scheme (IDS), claiming that the investments in certain companies belonged to them when in fact they belonged to Satyendar Kumar Jain.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that there were no reasonable grounds for believing that they were guilty of the alleged offenses. They claimed that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against them.
They also raised an objection regarding an inadvertent mistake in the Prosecution Complaint, which allegedly made the allegations vague.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the respondents had not satisfied the twin mandatory conditions laid down in Section 45 of PMLA. The High Court's judgment prima facie found the respondents guilty of the alleged offenses under PMLA.
The court also noted that the right to speedy trial and access to justice is a valuable right enshrined in the Constitution of India, and provisions of Section 436A of Cr.P.C would apply with full force to the cases of money laundering falling under Section 3 of PMLA.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed all the appeals filed by the respondents. The judgment stated that the respondents had miserably failed to satisfy the court that there were reasonable grounds for believing that they were not guilty of the alleged offenses.
The court also directed Satyendar Kumar Jain, who was released on bail due to medical reasons, to surrender forthwith before the Special Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the classification of an imported product under the Indian Customs Act. The product was seized by the customs authorities due to discrepancies in its parameters compared to the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) specifications. The appellants challenged the impugned orders passed by the lower courts, claiming that the seized product was 'most akin' to High-Speed Diesel (HSD).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
- The testing facilities for all parameters were not available, leading to inconclusive evidence.
- The expert opinion was not definitive, and further testing would be futile due to the product's deterioration over time.
- The "most akin" test should be applied, considering the lack of conclusive evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- Non-examination of any product/article/goods on all parameters laid down by the customs authority leads to uncertainty and doubt in confiscatory proceedings.
- The dispute could have been avoided if testing facilities for all parameters were available.
- It is incumbent upon the authorities to ensure necessary facilities are made available for testing.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, setting aside the impugned common judgment and order. The court directed the respondents to:
- Ensure proper facilities are made available in laboratories for undertaking tests on all parameters within six months.
- Provide for proper classification of goods based on conclusive evidence or give a benefit of doubt to the appellants.

The court held that it would be more appropriate to give the benefit of doubt to the appellants due to inconclusive evidence, rather than directing further testing and seeking fresh expert opinion.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an insurance claim under two policies by the appellant (beneficiary) against the respondent (insurance company). The respondent had repudiated the policy, alleging that the insured had fraudulently suppressed information about existing policies with other insurance companies. The appellant contested this, claiming that there was no suppression of material fact.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that the insured had failed to disclose existing policies with other insurance companies, which was a material fact that should have been disclosed. They produced a table showing existing policies, but it was incomplete and contradictory.
The appellant argued that the queries in Query Nos. 6.1 and 6.2 were not answered correctly by the respondent, and therefore, there was no suppression of any material fact. The contra proferentum rule was applied to interpret the policy in favor of the insured.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the respondent failed to adequately prove the fact that the insured had fraudulently suppressed information about existing policies with other insurance companies. The table produced by the respondent was incomplete and contradictory, and no officer from any other insurance company was examined to corroborate it.
The court also noted that the respondent's attempt to annex documents in support of their claim before the State Commission was declined due to the presentation of unauthenticated documents.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The impugned order dated 22.07.2019 passed by the NCDRC in Revision Petition No. 1268 of 2019 is set aside. The respondent company is directed to make the payment of the insurance claim under both the policies to the appellant, amounting to Rs. 7,50,000/- and Rs. 9,60,000/-, with interest at the rate of 7% per annum from the date of filing the complaint, till the actual realisation.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal filed by the Appellant against a judgment passed by the High Court, which had set aside a validation order dated 03.11.2017 passed by the Scrutiny Committee.
The Appellant claimed 'Mochi' caste and the Scrutiny Committee validated and granted the 'Mochi' caste certificate based on genealogical caste history of Appellant's forefathers.
The High Court, however, exercised its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and interfered with the order of the Scrutury Committee.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant argued that the Scrutiny Committee had followed due procedure under Rule 12, 17, and 18 of the 2012 Rules and there was nothing perverse about a finding of fact.
The Respondents argued that interference by this Court would amount to fiddling with the Presidential Order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Scrutiny Committee is an expert forum armed with fact-finding authority, and the High Court should not have interfered in its order.
The Appellant's claim for 'Mochi' caste was based on genealogical caste history of Appellant's forefathers, which was verified by the Scrutiny Committee in accordance with Entry 11 of the Presidential Order.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the High Court inadvertently undertook an erroneous exercise of appreciating evidence and swayed itself into a roving inquiry, which was not expected as per settled legal position.
The appeals stand allowed, and the impugned judgment passed by the High Court stands set aside. The validation order dated 03.11.2017 passed by the Scrutiny Committee is restored.
</JUDGMENT>

<FACTS>
The case involves cellular mobile service providers (assessees) and the Income Tax Department. The assessees are challenging the judgments of various High Courts that had directed them to deduct tax at source under Section 194-H of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The assessees argued that they were not required to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in payments received by distributors/franchisees from third parties/customers. They also argued that Section 194-H was not applicable to their transactions involving pre-paid coupons or starter-kits.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the term "agent" under Section 194-H should be restricted to one who has the power of affecting the legal position of his principal by making contracts or disposing of property. The court also noted that independent contractors, like the assessees, were not required to render accounts of their business and belonged to themselves.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the assessees would not be under a legal obligation to deduct tax at source on the income/profit component in payments received by distributors/franchisees from third parties/customers. Section 194-H was found not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. The appeals filed by the assessees were allowed, and their judgments were set aside. The appeals filed by the Revenue were dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves several appeals filed by different individuals, including Sharif Ahmed and Adil (SLP (Crl.) No. 1074/2017), Imran and Kamaluddin (SLP (Crl.) No. 5419/2022), and Manager Singh (SLP (Crl.) No. 9482/2021). The appeals are related to various FIRs registered in different police stations across Uttar Pradesh, including FIR Nos. 556 of 2019, 519 of 2019, and 556 of 2019.

The appellants have challenged the summoning orders issued against them by the court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate. Manager Singh has also challenged the non-bailable warrants issued against him.

Manager Singh's appeal is partly allowed, with the quashing of the summoning order and non-bailable warrants issued against him. However, the release on bail is subject to certain conditions fixed by the trial court in connection with the chargesheet under Sections 323, 504, 506, 120B, 308, and 325 IPC.

Imran and Kamaluddin's appeal is allowed, with a direction that they shall be released on anticipatory bail in connection with the chargesheet under Sections 420 and 120B IPC arising out of FIR No. 519/2019 dated 26.07.2019 registered at Police Station Chandpur, District Bijnor.

Sharif Ahmed and Adil's appeal is allowed, and the criminal proceedings are quashed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that non-bailable warrants were issued against Manager Singh despite the absence of any material on record to justify such issuance. The court also notes that the direction given by the High Court in its order dated 09.01.2020 restricting the grant of anticipatory bail till the filing of the chargesheet is modified.

The court further observes that Inder Mohan Goswami and Another v. State of Uttaranchal and Others, (2007) 12 SCC 1; Vikas v. State of Rajasthan, (2014) 3 SCC 321 are relevant precedents in this case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court partly allows the appeal filed by Manager Singh, quashing the summoning order and non-bailable warrants issued against him.

The court modifies the direction given by the High Court in its order dated 09.01.2020 restricting the grant of anticipatory bail till the filing of the chargesheet.

The court allows Imran and Kamaluddin's appeal, directing them to be released on anticipatory bail in connection with the chargesheet under Sections 420 and 120B IPC arising out of FIR No. 519/2019 dated 26.07.2019 registered at Police Station Chandpur, District Bijnor.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court of Judicature at Bombay had passed an order in two appeals, one of which was set aside and the other restored. The case involved a dispute related to an arbitral award. The appellants sought interim relief during the pendency of their appeals.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court noted that the members of the bar were taking up many grounds in petitions under Section 34, which are not covered by law and wasting the court's time. This inefficiency is a result of breaching the arbitral procedure.
The appellants requested that the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court on August 11th, 2023 be continued till the disposal of the remanded appeal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court made several observations regarding the need for brevity in arbitral proceedings. It stated that incorporating only legally permissible grounds in petitions under Section 34 and appeals under Section 37 will make the arbitral procedure more effective.
The court noted that if this trend continues, the very object of adopting the UNCITRAL model will be frustrated. Arbitration must become a tool for expeditious, effective, and cost-effective dispute resolution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned judgment dated July 7th, 2023 in Commercial Appeal No. 31 of 2023 and restored Commercial Appeal No. 30 of 2023 to the file of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
The court directed that the parties appear before the concerned Bench on July 29th, 2024 and permitted the appellants to file an amended memorandum of appeal containing only relevant and permissible grounds.
The interim relief granted by the Supreme Court on August 11th, 2023 was continued till the disposal of the remanded appeal.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquittal of two accused persons, Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (A1) and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel (A2), who were convicted by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court for allegedly assaulting Jiva (deceased) in police custody at Amraiwadi Police Station.
Jiva was a prisoner in Sabarmati Central Jail, and the prosecution theory was that he was assaulted while detained at the Amraiwadi Police Station. However, the medical evidence suggests that the injuries were inflicted before his death.
The Investigating Agency failed to investigate the prison authorities and the jail records regarding Jiva's injuries upon admission to the jail premises.
The theory of motive attributed by the prosecution witnesses (PW-1 and PW-2) to the accused A1 and A2 is also not palpable, as A1 was a new Police Inspector at Amraiwadi Police Station just a few months before the incident.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to bring home the guilt of both accused persons by leading cogent, convincing, and reliable evidence.
The medical evidence suggests that the injuries were inflicted before Jiva's death, which makes it improbable that he was assaulted in police custody at Amraiwadi Police Station.
The prison authorities' failure to note the injuries upon admission to the jail premises is also crucial for arriving at the truth of the matter.
The theory of motive attributed by the prosecution witnesses (PW-1 and PW-2) to the accused A1 and A2 is not palpable, as there was no apparent reason for them to single out Jiva for custodial torture.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Investigating Agency failed to investigate the prison authorities and the jail records regarding Jiva's injuries upon admission to the jail premises.
If at all Jiva was having the large number of injuries as noted in the postmortem report (Exhibit-50), the prison authorities would definitely have made a note thereof in the jail records at the time of his admission in the jail premises and the observations made at that time would be crucial for arriving at the truth of the matter.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the prosecution failed to bring home the guilt of both accused persons by leading cogent, convincing, and reliable evidence. 
Therefore, the judgment dated 4th March, 1997 passed by the trial Court and judgment dated 13th February, 2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court are quashed and set aside.
Both the accused i.e., Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (A1) (since deceased) and Chinubhai Govindbhai Patel (A2) (since deceased) are acquitted of the charges. 
The appeal is allowed in these terms, and the pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The shares belonging to the appellants were transferred to the State Government in 1973. The appellants instituted a suit claiming a valuation of Rs.70.50 per share in 1978 and subsequently sought an amendment increasing the valuation to Rs.874/- per share based on a private valuer's report. The appellants accepted the valuation of Rs.640/- per share as determined by M/s Ray & Ray, which was also ordered by the High Court and affirmed by this Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants claimed interest at 18% with quarterly rest or 15% with monthly rest, but the court held that their claim of interest is unreasonable. The court considered the prolonged pendency of the dispute regarding the valuation of shares, which has only been determined recently, and the substantial share amount involved.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the rate and period of interest cannot be applied mechanically or at an unreasonably high rate without any rationale. The court noted that while the claimant is fairly compensated, the award should not become punitive or unduly burdensome on the Judgement Debtor.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court awarded simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum from 8th July 1975, on the enhanced valuation of shares till the date of decree and interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of decree till the date of realisation. The interest shall be paid along with the amount due towards the enhanced value of the shares after adjusting the amount already paid to the appellants within a period of two months from today.

A case involving an Advocate-on-Record, Mr. P.Soma Sundaram and another Advocate, Mr. S.Muthukrishnan, who filed a Special Leave Petition (Criminal) without disclosing the fact that they had already filed a similar petition against the same impugned order.
The Advocates come from remote villages in Tamil Nadu and have an unblemished track record.
They had tendered unconditional apologies for their misconduct and promised not to repeat it in future.
Several Senior Advocates, Office Bearers of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), and Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) appealed to the court for mercy.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Advocates argued that they had made a mistake by not disclosing the factum of the filing of the first Special Leave Petition (Criminal).
They tendered unconditional apologies and promised not to repeat the misconduct in future.
They requested the court to accept their apology and render justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Advocates' apology appears to be honest and genuine.
Their remorse is evident, and they have promised not to repeat the misconduct in future.
Imposing costs or suspending them would cast a stigma on their future.
Considering their plea, unconditional apology, and unblemished track record, the court decided to take a lenient view.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court accepted the Advocates' unconditional apologies and warned them of being careful not to repeat any such misconduct in future.
They were directed to ensure that they shall appear before all cases where they have entered appearances.
The case stands closed.

<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the validity of an entire selection process conducted by the West Bengal Public Service Commission (WBPSC). The selection process led to the appointment of several candidates, including some who were already employed in different departments of the State Government or autonomous bodies. The impugned judgment declared the entire selection process null and void due to egregious violations and illegalities that violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it can be inferred that the respondents (applicants) argued against the declaration of the entire selection process as null and void. The appellants (petitioners), on the other hand, may have argued that the selection process was marred by irregularities and therefore, should be cancelled.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the entire examination process and results were declared void due to egregious violations and illegalities. The court also noted that some of the appointed candidates who do not fall within the category of tainted candidates may have previously worked in different departments of the State Government or with autonomous bodies, and they will be allowed to apply to their previous departments or autonomous bodies to continue in service.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the impugned judgment cancelling en bloc / entire selection process but made certain modifications in the directions issued by the High Court. The appeals were disposed of in the aforesaid terms. The court also directed that the disabled candidates mentioned in the previous paragraph will be allowed to participate in the fresh selection process, if required, with age relaxation and other concessions. Similarly, other candidates who are not specifically tainted will also be eligible to participate, with appropriate age relaxation.

<FACTS>
The case involves land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act (LA Act) for a project in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. The appellants are the landowners who have challenged the award of compensation made by the District Collector.
The High Court had allowed the appeals of the landowners and enhanced their compensation amount. However, the State has filed Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) before the Supreme Court to set aside the judgment of the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:
* The landowners argued that the award of compensation made by the District Collector was too low and did not take into account the market value of their land.
* The State argued that the land acquisition is for a public purpose, specifically for a development project in Haridwar, and that the compensation awarded to the landowners is reasonable.
* The landowners also raised an issue regarding the change of land use (CLU) permission and the owners paying CLU rates.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed:
* The court noted that the award of compensation made by the District Collector was in accordance with the LA Act, but it did not take into account the market value of the land.
* The court also observed that the High Court had enhanced the compensation amount to a reasonable level based on the market value of the land.
* The court further noted that the State's argument regarding the public purpose of the land acquisition was not disputed by the landowners.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held:
* The judgment of the High Court dated 20.09.2022 in RFA No. 701/2022 and batch is set aside, except for the direction to pay statutory benefits under Section 23(1-A), 23(2) & 28 of the LA Act.
* The appellants are entitled to a compensation amount of Rs. 1,18,37,668/- per acre, and they will also be paid statutory benefits in accordance with law after deducting the amounts already paid to them.
* However, the landowners will not be entitled to interest for the period of delay in filing/delay in refiling after delayed filing of the appeal(s).

<FACTS>
The case involves a petition filed by the AMP Group under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The petition seeks to compel the SRG Group to participate in arbitration proceedings related to a dispute over a Family Arrangement Agreement (FAA). The FAA is alleged to have been entered into between the petitioner (AMP Group), the respondent (SRG Group), and the JRS Group. The dispute centers around the interpretation of certain clauses in the FAA, particularly regarding the exit conditions for the SRG Group from its participation in a business venture.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The AMP Group argues that the SRG Group is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement and should be compelled to participate in the proceedings. The petitioner relies on several precedents, including Sasan Power Ltd. vs. North Carolinacoal Corporation, to support their contention that the SRG Group's participation in negotiations and performance of the underlying contract makes them bound by the arbitration agreement.
The SRG Group contests this assertion, arguing that they have not agreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement. They contend that a dual test needs to be satisfied before they can be compelled to participate in the arbitration proceedings: (a) they must have agreed to the underlying contract, and (b) they must have agreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India observes that under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the court is not empowered to conduct a mini-trial or delve into contested or disputed questions of fact. The Court notes that the determination of whether the SRG Group is a veritable party to the arbitration agreement requires a detailed examination of the evidence adduced by the parties.
The Court also finds force in the contention of the petitioner AMP Group that the nomenclature of the agreement (in this case, "Family Arrangement Agreement") does not preclude the impleadment of the SRG Group in arbitration proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court allows the petition and appoints Mr. Akil Kureshi (Former Chief Justice, High Court of Rajasthan) as the sole arbitrator. The Court orders that all rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that despite some discrepancies in the testimony of witnesses, there was sufficient evidence to convict Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla (A-8). The acquittal of the other accused persons was based on the lack of substantial evidence against them.

The case involves a state legislation, referred to as the "Act," which was intended to benefit marginalized and impoverished individuals. The implementation of this Act lies with the State of Maharashtra. Despite its intention, the Act has failed to ameliorate the conditions of its beneficiaries.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argues that the judiciary can and ought to perform a facilitative role in access to justice and effective functioning of constitutional bodies. This role involves nudging and providing impetus for systemic reforms, rather than reviewing executive and legislative actions. The court also notes that an overwhelming majority of legislations are introduced and carried through by the government, with few private member bills being introduced and debated.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that there has been no comprehensive statutory audit undertaken regarding the implementation of the Act. The court also notes that many statutory schemes and procedures are gridlocked in bureaucratic or judicial quagmires that impede or delay statutory objectives.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court to constitute a bench to initiate suo motu proceedings for reviewing the working of the statute. The concerned bench will hear the government, statutory authorities, necessary stakeholders, and intended beneficiaries.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a review petition filed by the respondents against an order of this Court, which dismissed their appeal. The High Court allowed specific performance in favor of the petitioner but limited it to 90% of the sale consideration. The review petitions challenged the High Court's decision.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented were:
- Limitation: Whether the doctrine of lis pendens applies when a petition is filed within the period of limitation and whether it should be considered from the date of institution or notice being issued by this Court.
- Specific Performance: Whether specific performance can be granted to the purchaser who breached an essential condition of the contract, causing undue delay in filing the suit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made were:
- The doctrine of lis pendens kicks in at the stage of institution and not at the stage when notice is issued by this Court.
- Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act would apply to the third-party purchaser once the sale was executed after the review petition was instituted before this Court.
- Any transfer made during the pendency of the litigation is subject to the final result of the litigation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by this Court:
- The High Court's decision allowing specific performance in favor of the petitioner but limiting it to 90% of the sale consideration was challenged.
- This Court held that it was not a fit case to exercise discretion to grant relief in terms of Section 12 because the purchaser breached an essential condition of the contract and the suit was filed beyond limitation.
- The judgment of the High Court dated 23 April 2021 is restored, allowing the review petitions.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court allowed an appeal against the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, which had quashed a writ of certiorari and a writ of mandamus issued by the Tribunal. The Appellant established on the balance of probabilities that a different decision realistically could have been made if the Tribunal followed the process of reasoning required by the Direction in deciding whether the Cancellation Decision should be revoked.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the executing court did not deem fit to afford one opportunity of hearing to them, despite some delay on their part in responding to the summons. They claimed that this was a severe consequence and that the executing court should have been more considerate in declining to take their objections on record.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court noted that there was a significant delay by the appellants in responding to the summons, but did not consider it sufficient reason to deny them an opportunity of hearing. The High Court observed that the supervisory jurisdiction vested in it under Article 227 of the Constitution is meant to take care of such situations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court set aside the order passed by itself and also that of the executing court. It allowed the appeal, clarifying that it shall be open for the respondents (decree-holders) to file a fresh application if there is any interference at the instance of the appellants (judgment-debtors) in so far as their possession of the property in question is concerned.

The case revolves around a husband and wife who were involved in a domestic dispute. The wife filed a complaint against her husband under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for allegedly subjecting her to cruelty. The FIR was lodged on April 9, 2021, and the proceedings were pending before the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Hisar.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the defense argued against the wife's allegations and sought to quash the FIR.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that Section 498A of the IPC has been a subject of controversy due to its potential misuse by women who seek to harass their husbands or in-laws. The court noted that the provision was intended to protect married women from cruelty, but it has led to numerous false and frivolous complaints.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the husband's appeal and quashed the FIR against him. The court observed that the wife's allegations were unsubstantiated and did not warrant further investigation or prosecution. The court also directed the Registry to send a copy of its judgment to the Law Commission and the Union Law Secretary, recommending changes to Section 498A of the IPC to prevent its misuse.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the execution of a sale deed. The plaintiffs (respondents) had entered into an agreement to purchase land from the defendants (appellants). However, the sale deed was not executed due to various reasons. The plaintiffs claimed that they were ready and willing to execute the sale deed but were not allowed to do so by the defendants. The defendants denied these claims and alleged that the plaintiffs never had the funds to clear the balance sale consideration and were only interested in blocking the property for personal gain.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* Plaintiffs (respondents) argued that they were always ready and willing to execute the sale deed, but the defendants refused to do so. They claimed that the defendants' refusal was unjustified and prayed for specific performance of the agreement.
* Defendants (appellants) argued that the plaintiffs never had the funds to clear the balance sale consideration and were only interested in blocking the property for personal gain. They contended that the plaintiffs' claims of being ready and willing to execute the sale deed were false.

The court also considered the conduct of the parties throughout the dispute, including the fact that the plaintiffs made a payment of Rs. 12,000 as advance money but failed to clear the balance sale consideration.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The court noted that the plaintiffs' conduct throughout the dispute gave credence to the defendants' contention that the plaintiffs never had the funds to clear the balance sale consideration and were only interested in blocking the property for personal gain.
* The court observed that the value of the property has increased significantly over the years, with the current value being approximately four crores. However, the court did not consider this factor in determining the outcome of the case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order, which had granted specific performance of the agreement to the plaintiffs.
* The suit was dismissed, but with a direction that the defendants (appellants) compensate the plaintiffs by paying an amount of Rs. 30 lakhs within three months from the date of the judgment.
* The court also directed the defendants to pay Rs. 24 lakhs as compensation for the advance money paid by the plaintiffs and Rs. 6 lakhs as costs of litigation.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a murder charge against seven accused persons (appellants). The prosecution's case is based on circumstantial evidence. The post-mortem report indicates that the death was unnatural, suggesting the possibility of murder.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' defense argues that the prosecution has failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. They point out several weaknesses in the prosecution's case, including:
* Glaring doubts regarding the offense of abduction
* Lack of direct evidence to prove the commission of murder by the accused persons
* Conspicuous absence of a link between the accused persons and the alleged offense
* Failure of circumstantial evidence to meet the test of proof

The appellants also argue that motive, which is often used as a basis for conviction in such cases, cannot be relied upon alone. They point out that both the accused persons and the eyewitnesses belong to the same family and have a property-related dispute, making it difficult to determine who would benefit from implicating the other.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the prosecution's case is full of reasonable doubts that strike at the foundation of their case. The court notes that in cases based on circumstantial evidence, the chain of evidence must be complete and give out an inescapable conclusion of guilt.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court sets aside the findings of conviction arrived at by the Trial Court and the High Court. It also reverses the acquittal of A-6 and A-7. The court concludes that the appellants are liable to be acquitted of all charges due to the prosecution's failure to discharge its burden to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
The judgment states: "Having observed that the case of the prosecution is full of glaring doubts as regards the offence of abduction, we may briefly note and reiterate that the offence of murder is entirely dependent on circumstantial evidence. Although, the post-mortem report indicates that the death of the deceased was unnatural and the commission of murder cannot be ruled out. But there is no direct evidence on record to prove the commission of murder by the accused persons."

The court orders the release of all seven accused persons (appellants) if they are lying in custody.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over pay parity between the posts of SDI/ABSA and DBSA in the State's Education Department. The matter has been pending for a long time, resulting in significant hardships for the parties involved.
The Government had issued an order in 2011 prescribing a specific pay scale for the posts of SDI/ABSA and DBSA, but it was later set aside by the High Court.
The appeal before the Supreme Court seeks to overturn the High Court's decision and restore the 2011 Order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court erred in setting aside the 2011 Order, which prescribed a specific pay scale for the posts of SDI/ABSA and DBSA.
They contended that the Government had valid reasons for issuing the 2011 Order and that it was not arbitrary or discriminatory.
The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the 2011 Order was unjustified and that the High Court's decision to set it aside was correct.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the case has been pending for a long time, resulting in significant hardships for the parties involved.
It noted that pay parity disputes often lead to prolonged litigation, causing challenges and hardships for the parties.
The Court also observed that the 2011 Order was meant only for officials belonging to the State's Education Department and should not be taken as a precedent by employees of other departments.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal in part and set aside the High Court's decision to set aside the 2011 Order.
It held that the private respondents and their colleagues in the same cadre are entitled to the pay scale prescribed in the 2011 Order, notionally from 01.01.2006 and actually from 01.12.2008.
The Court also directed that any payment made to the respondents more than what they are entitled to with effect from 01.12.2008 shall not be recovered from them.
Finally, the Court ordered that the arrears of pay or pension, if not already paid, shall be paid to the respondents within a period of four months along with interest @ 7% per annum.

<Facts>
The case involves a matrimonial dispute between Hussainbhai's sister and her husband, Abbasbhai. The incident occurred inside the residence of Asgarali (Hussainbhai's father) when Abbasbhai and Idrishbhai came to their residence leading to a ruckus. Hussainbhai, who was 18 years old at the time, attacked the deceased and his son with a knife.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The High Court altered the conviction of both Asgarali and Hussainbhai from one under Section 304 Part I IPC to one under Section 304 Part II IPC.
- The appellant's (Hussainbhai) defense was that he was emotionally upset due to his sister's alleged ill-treatment by her in-laws, and the incident occurred in the heat of the moment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- Hussainbhai was a young man who was overcome by emotion when physically attacking the deceased and his son.
- The fact that the incident was not premeditated is buttressed by it occurring inside the residence of Asgarali.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in the case is:
- The High Court's alteration of conviction from Section 304 Part I IPC to Section 304 Part II IPC is upheld.
- Hussainbhai's sentence is modified to the period already undergone by him, while maintaining his conviction under Section 304 Part II IPC.
- All other criminal appeals are dismissed.

<FACTS>
The case involves a motor vehicle accident where the claimant/respondents sought compensation from various parties, including the owner of the vehicle (Hindustan Motors), the dealer, and the driver. The Tribunal awarded compensation to be jointly and severally paid by all parties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant (driver) argued that they were not the owner or in control/command of the vehicle at the time of the accident, and therefore should not be liable for the compensation. They also claimed that Hindustan Motors alone was liable for the compensation awarded.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Tribunal had returned a finding on issue no.3 that Hindustan Motors had provided no evidence to show that the vehicle manufactured and owned by it was sold to the dealer. This part of the award operated against Hindustan Motors and was backed by a finding of ownership. By not challenging this through an appeal or cross-objection, Hindustan Motors allowed it to attain finality.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that apart from the driver, Hindustan Motors alone was liable for the compensation awarded. Therefore, the appellant should not have been burdened with liability to pay compensation. However, as the SLP had already been dismissed qua the claimant-respondents, the award enabling them to recover the awarded compensation jointly or severally from the owner, dealer, and driver could not be set aside.

The Court allowed the appeal to the extent that if the awarded amount, or any part thereof, has been paid by the appellant, they shall be entitled to recover the same from Hindustan Motors along with interest at 6% p.a., with effect from the date of payment till the date of recovery.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a divorce dispute between the appellant-wife and respondent-husband. The appellant had put forth a demand of Rs. 5 to 7 Crores as one-time settlement, which would cover her maintenance expenses and necessary requirements. On the other hand, the respondent expressed his willingness to pay only Rs. 50 Lakhs towards permanent alimony. The court explored the possibility of one-time settlement between the parties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments advanced by the learned senior counsel on both sides were considered by the court while making a decision regarding the amount of permanent alimony that should be awarded to the appellant-wife. The court noted that the respondent had the legal obligation and financial capacity to maintain his wife after dissolution of marriage.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the demand made by the appellant is exceptionally high, but at the same time, the amount offered by the respondent is insufficient in the broader rubric of maintenance considerations. The court also noted that the award of maintenance or permanent alimony should not be penal but should be for the purposes of ensuring a decent living standard for the appellant wife.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court fixed a one-time settlement amount of Rs. 2 Crores as permanent alimony to be paid by the respondent to the appellant within a period of four months. The appeals were allowed, and the orders and judgments of the courts below were set aside. Any pending cases would be disposed of accordingly, and the decree of divorce was granted in exercise of this Court's power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.

<FACTS>
The case involves the inheritance of a tenancy by Smt. Usha Mitra and her co-appellants from Sh. S.K. Mitra, who passed away in 1970. The appellants claimed that their tenancy did not expire in 2006 due to the introduction of the 1997 Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court held that since the legislature can restrict heritability by amending or repealing the law, it had done precisely that in the 1997 Act. They argued that the addition of the words "five years from the date of death of such tenant or from the date of coming into force of this Act, whichever is later" meant that the death of SK Mitra in 1970 also stands covered under the new Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Statutory laws operate prospectively unless there is a clear and unequivocal intention to make them retrospective. The Division Bench's interpretation of a statutory provision will not make the law retrospective and take away the heritable rights of a tenant. In this case, there was no such intention expressed in the 1997 Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the impugned judgments, and held that Smt. Usha Mitra and the appellants jointly inherited the tenancy from Sh. S.K. Mitra in 1970. The Court ruled that the appellants' tenancy did not expire in 2006 due to the introduction of the 1997 Act, as there was no clear and unequivocal intention to make the law retrospective.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the payment of customs duty under Section 125(2) of the Customs Act, 1962. The facts are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellant's Argument: The Appellant argued that when liability to pay customs duty has occasioned under Section 125, the calculation, determination or assessment of such duty cannot be made under Section 28.

Respondent's Counter-Argument: The Respondent countered that the payment of customs duty has not arisen either under Section 12 or Section 28, it has arisen because of Section 125(2). Therefore, a notice under Section 28 is not necessary.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the liability to pay duty arises under sub-section (2) in addition to the fine under sub-section (1) of Section 125. The order for payment of duty under Section 125(2) would be an integral part of proceedings relating to confiscation and consequential orders thereon.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that:

* Liability to pay duty will include the liability to pay interest on delayed payment under section 28AB of the Act.
* The order for payment of duty under Section 125(2) would be an integral part of proceedings relating to confiscation and consequential orders thereon.
* Jagdish Cancer case is not an authority for the proposition that when the liability to pay customs duty has occasioned under Section 125, the calculation, determination or assessment of such duty cannot be made under Section 28.

<FACTS>
The case involves a batch of appeals challenging the judgment of the High Court dated 15.07.2008, which quashed the acquisition of land by the State of Haryana under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The land was acquired for public purposes, including urban development.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's judgment was incorrect and that the acquisition of land was valid. They contended that the land was acquired for a public purpose and that the compensation awarded to the respondents was adequate. The State of Haryana also supported the appeals, arguing that the High Court's judgment had caused significant harm to the public interest.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the High Court's judgment had caused adverse effects on the subject acquisition and could lead to significant harm to the public at large. The court noted that the land was acquired for a public purpose and that it is essential to utilize the land in accordance with its intended purpose.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, setting aside the High Court's judgment dated 15.07.2008. The court ordered that if no award had been passed earlier for the Respondent’s land under the 1894 Act, a fresh award should be made expeditiously and within three months. If an award had already been passed, the Respondents were granted liberty to avail their remedy under Section 18 of the 1894 Act. The court also directed that if the land of the Respondents has similar potentiality and utility as the acquired land, they will be entitled to seek compensation at the same rate. Finally, the State of Haryana and the HSVP were directed to take possession of the subject-land in accordance with law and commence development works without delay.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, a member of the Popular Front of India (PFI), was accused of commissioning offences under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The charge sheet against him alleged that he was involved in various activities of PFI, which is a designated terrorist organization. However, the first schedule did not list PFI as a terrorist organization.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that there were no reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against him of commissioning offences under UAPA was prima facie true. He contended that the charge sheet and witness statement Z did not provide sufficient evidence to support the allegations. The appellant further submitted that his antecedents had not been brought on record, which made it impossible to conclude that he was involved in any terrorist activities.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Special Court and the High Court did not objectively consider the material in the charge sheet while rejecting the bail application of the appellant. The focus was more on the activities of PFI, which led to an improper appreciation of the appellant's case. The observations also noted that when a case is made out for the grant of bail, the Courts should have no hesitation in granting it.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned orders rejecting the bail application of the appellant. The Court directed the Special Court to enlarge the appellant on bail until the conclusion of the trial on appropriate terms and conditions. The tentative findings recorded in the judgment were confined only to the case of the appellant and would have no bearing on the trial and cases of the co-accused.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the termination of services of a police officer, respondent, by the Disciplinary Authority and upheld by the Appellate Authority. The respondent was charged with deliberately withholding information about a pending criminal case against him while applying for a job in a Law Enforcement Agency.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the termination of services was justified due to the respondent's deliberate withholding of information about the pending criminal case, which is a serious misconduct requiring termination. The appellants also cited the higher standard of rectitude required for appointment in a Law Enforcement Agency and the importance of maintaining law and order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Appellate Authority fell into an error by observing that it was incumbent on the appellants to prove that the respondent knew about the pending criminal case. The records showed that the respondent was aware of the FIR registered against him and had remained in judicial custody, being released on bail by the trial Court along with other co-accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the decision of the Disciplinary Authority to terminate the services of the respondent. The court observed that the appellants exercised their discretion as employers in a reasonable manner and that the termination was not unjustified, tainted by malafides or arbitrariness, or too harsh.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent is registered as a factory under the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Act for the same premises. The appellants filed a complaint against the respondent, and an order issuing process was passed by the Magistrate. However, the High Court quashed the order on the grounds that the respondent was not carrying out any manufacturing activity.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the respondent's activities fall under the definition of a "manufacturing process" as per Section 2(k) of the Factories Act, 1948. The respondent countered that they were only providing services and not engaging in any manufacturing activity.

The court also considered the judgment in J.P. Lights India v. Regional Director ESI Corporation, Bangalore (2023 SCC OnLine SC 1271), which held that servicing electrical goods constitutes a "manufacturing process".
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the respondent's registration as a factory under the ESIC Act and their provision of services to customers, including adapting or repairing electrical goods, constituted a "manufacturing process" within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the Factories Act.

Additionally, the court noted that the mere fact of registration did not determine the outcome but was instead used as an independent factor in the analysis.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed by the Supreme Court, and the order of the High Court quashing the order issuing process was set aside. The complaint filed by the appellants along with the order issuing process would stand restored to the file of the learned Magistrate Judge, Panaji, and shall be proceeded with in accordance with law.

The case revolves around the acquisition of land by a company, JAL (Respondent No. 11), from the State of Himachal Pradesh for its industrial purposes. The acquisition proceedings commenced in 2008 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. A notification was issued on July 25, 2008, and a supplementary award was passed on May 2, 2022.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties are as follows:

* The State of Himachal Pradesh argued that the acquisition proceedings were valid and that JAL was required to pay the cost of acquisition before taking possession of the land.
* JAL contended that it had paid the amount of compensation to the State, but that the payment was not made to the correct authorities, leading to a delay in the disbursement of funds to the affected landowners (Respondent Nos. 1-6).
* The Respondent Nos. 1-6 claimed that they had not received the payment for their land and sought compensation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:

* The acquisition proceedings were initiated under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, but no agreement was entered into between JAL and the State as required by Section 41 of the same act.
* The supplementary award passed on May 2, 2022, stipulated that the amount of compensation would be paid to the affected landowners after determining the cost of acquisition.
* However, before the determination of the cost of acquisition, the subject land was transferred to JAL, which is in contravention of Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

* The liability to pay the cost of acquisition ultimately falls on JAL as per the agreement entered into between the State and the company.
* The State is directed to pay the amount of Rs. 3,05,31,095/- (Rupees Three Crore Five Lakh Thirty-One Thousand and Ninety-Five Only) along with 9% interest thereupon from the date of passing of the Supplementary Award i.e., May 2, 2022, till the date of realization.
* The total amount paid by the State shall be recovered from JAL (Respondent No. 11).

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between an appellant and respondents regarding the commissioning of a solar power project. The project was initially supposed to be commissioned within 24 months, but due to various reasons, including land use conversion issues, the project faced delays. The respondents requested an extension of time under Article 2.5 of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which was granted by the appellant in a letter dated 02.03.2017 for a period of 6 months. However, the project was still not commissioned within the extended period, leading to disputes between the parties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties include:
- The respondents claimed that they had acted diligently and with care and caution to secure approvals, and therefore their claims should not be rejected through recourse to Article 8.3(b)(iv) of the PPA.
- The appellant argued that the delay was attributable to the respondents and not covered by the force majeure clause or that there was non-compliance with the notice requirement under Article 8.3(b)(i).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- The government's direction to DISCOMs dated 24.11.2016 to set up 3-member committees to consider each request for extension.
- The large number of cases that raise similar grounds and the government's response show that the delay was not faced by the respondents alone, and hence cannot be entirely blamed on them.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states:
- The APTEL held that the delay is not attributable to the respondents and that the force majeure clause is applicable.
- The APTEL rightly held that the extension of time under Article 2.5 is warranted, and the commissioning of the project on 24.08.2017 is within the extended period of 24 months.
- The APTEL also rightly held that there is no occasion for the imposition of liquidated damages under Articles 2.2 and 2.5.7 or for the reduction of tariff under Article 5.1 of the PPA.
- The Court rejected the appellant's contentions and dismissed the appeals.

The case involves a group of temporary employees working in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22, who were denied pensionary benefits despite serving the government for decades. The appellants argued that their service conditions, as evolved over time, warranted reclassification from temporary to regular status.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' arguments were based on the principle that "the essence of employment and the rights thereof cannot be merely determined by the initial terms of appointment when the actual course of employment has evolved significantly over time." The appellants cited administrative orders and Board proceedings that consistently treated them as equivalent to regular government employees.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the mere classification of employees as 'temporary' or 'permanent' is not merely a matter of nomenclature, but carries significant legal implications, particularly in terms of service benefits and protections. The denial of pensionary benefits solely on the basis of temporary status without due consideration of these factors was deemed an oversimplification of their employment relationship with the government.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the denial of pensionary benefits to the appellants is not tenable or justifiable in the eyes of law as it is arbitrary and violates the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The respondents were directed to extend the benefits of the 6th Central Pay Commission, including pensionary benefits under the Revised Pay Scale Rules, 2008, to the appellants in the same terms as are being afforded to their peers in the Accounts Section of SFF HQ Estt. No. 22.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a murder charge against seven accused persons (appellants). The prosecution's case is based on circumstantial evidence, including the testimonies of eye witnesses. The post-mortem report indicates that the death of the deceased was unnatural, suggesting the possibility of murder.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the appellants are guilty of murder and abduction, relying on the circumstantial evidence presented in court. However, the defence raises several doubts regarding the prosecution's case, including inconsistencies in the testimonies of eye witnesses, lack of direct evidence linking the appellants to the crime, and a property-related dispute between the accused persons and eyewitnesses that could have led to false accusations.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that the prosecution's case is full of glaring doubts regarding the offence of abduction. The post-mortem report indicates that the death was unnatural, but there is no direct evidence linking the appellants to the commission of murder. The circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution fails to meet the test of proof and cannot be termed as proved in the eyes of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes that the prosecution has failed to discharge its burden to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The reasonable doubts indicated are irreconcilable and strike at the foundation of the prosecution's case. Therefore, the appellants are liable to be acquitted of all charges. The impugned judgment as well as the judgment rendered by the Trial Court (to the extent of conviction of A-1 to A-5) are set aside, and all seven accused persons (appellants) are hereby acquitted of all the charges levelled upon them.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Rewa Tollway, a road construction project under the Build-Operate-Transfer (B.O.T.) scheme. The lessee spent approximately 50% of the total cost of the project, which was Rs.54 crores.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
No arguments are explicitly mentioned in the given text, but it appears that the appellants challenged the demand raised by the State on the entire project cost for stamp duty. The lessee argued that they only had to pay 2% of the amount likely to be spent under the agreement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's view was fortified by two judgments, one being Civil Appeal No.8985 of 2013 (Rewa Tollway), which stated that any instrument by which tolls are let is considered a lease for the purpose of payment of stamp duty under the Stamp Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court partly allowed the appeals, holding that:

* The lessee only had to pay 2% on the amount likely to be spent under the agreement by the lessee (Section 33).
* The demand raised on the whole amount would be unjustified (Section 34).
* In case of any deficit in stamp duty not having been deposited, the appellants would deposit the same within two months of the fresh demand being raised by the Revenue Officer/Collector (Stamps) of the district concerned (Section 35).

The Collector (Stamps)/Revenue Officer was directed to calculate the amount in each case individually and communicate it to the appellants within a period of two months from today. Where the amount is lying in excess with the State, the same shall be refunded within a period of two months of such determination (Section 34).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute regarding the ownership of a suit land. The plaintiff, who is the first respondent in the appeal, claimed to be entitled to recovery of possession of the suit property. The defendants, who are the appellants in the appeal, contested this claim and argued that they had created third-party rights in the property.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the plaintiff's case relied on establishing their right to ownership over the suit land, while the defendants' case may have centered around the creation of third-party rights and potential limitations on the plaintiff's claims.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the reckoning of the period of limitation from the date of commencement of the right of ownership of the plaintiff was appropriate. The court also noted that concurrent findings can be set aside if perversity is found with the impugned decision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment dismissed the appeals, upholding the well-merited decision of the High Court in the impugned judgment. The court also closed the contempt petition, discharging the notice issued to alleged contemnors and leaving the first respondent to execute the decree in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The accused was convicted under section 302 r/w 34 IPC for shooting the deceased. The accused was acquitted of the charge under section 25/27 of the Arms Act, arising out of the same crime. The accused had served a sentence for a period of 13 years 6 months and 20 days without remission and the total sentence of 17 years 1 month and 9 days.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court considered the sentence imposed on the accused in light of the guiding principles mentioned earlier. The facts and circumstances highlighted that due to sudden provocation, for not giving jaggery, the accused came to the house of the deceased and shot the deceased with no premeditation in the commission of crime. The accused was acquitted of the charge under section 25/27 of the Arms Act and convicted only for the offence under section 302 r/w 34 IPC. The accused had good conduct during his period of incarceration, and there existed a possibility of reformation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the object of punishment is not only to deter the accused from committing any further crime but also to reform and retribute. The extent of reformation can be derived only by the conduct of the accused exhibited during his days of retribution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The sentence awarded by the Sessions Court as affirmed by the High Court, was modified to the period already undergone by the accused. However, it was clarified that the accused shall pay the fine amount imposed by the Sessions Court, if not paid already. The bail bond executed by the accused stands discharged.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent had completed the Kal Awadhi for promotion from the post of Under Secretary to Joint Secretary, but his date of promotion was 5th March, 2003. The Board rejected his plea for shifting his date of promotion to the post of Joint Secretary from 5th March, 2003 to 29th July, 1997. The reason given by the Board was that there was no vacant post of Joint Secretary during the period between 29th July, 1997 to 5th March, 2003.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that he had completed the Kal Awadhi for promotion from the post of Under Secretary to Joint Secretary and therefore his date of promotion should be reckoned from 29th July, 1997. The Board argued that there was no vacant post of Joint Secretary during the period between 29th July, 1997 to 5th March, 2003.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the action of the Board was guided by administrative exigencies and not malafides or colourable exercise of power. The Resolution of the Board dated 26th December, 1991 for fixing the Kal Awadhi was only directory in nature and cannot be treated as statutory for the respondent to have claimed an entitlement to promotion reckoned from 29th July, 1997.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that merely because the respondent had completed the Kal Awadhi for promotion from the post of Under Secretary to Joint Secretary, would not necessarily entitle him for appointment from the date the post fell vacant. The appeal succeeded and the impugned order dated 20th October 2011 was set aside. The order dated 3rd October, 2007 passed by the learned Single Judge was restored.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, accused of committing a gruesome crime, hails from a poor nomadic community in Maharashtra. He had an alcoholic father and suffered parental neglect and poverty. He dropped out of school at the age of 10 years old and was forced to start working to support his family, doing odd jobs. The appellant has no criminal antecedents and various mitigating circumstances exist in his favor.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's argument is not mentioned in the case summary. However, based on the judgment, it can be inferred that the prosecution likely argued for the imposition of the death penalty due to the gravity of the crime.
The defense argued that the doctrine of "rarest of rare" requires that the death sentence should not be imposed if there is no possibility of reformation by a criminal. The defense also pointed out various mitigating circumstances, including the appellant's poverty-stricken background and lack of education.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that while the crime committed by the appellant was grave and unpardonable, it was not appropriate to affirm the death sentence awarded to him. The court noted that the doctrine of "rarest of rare" requires that death sentence should be imposed only if there is no possibility of reformation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court partly allowed the appeal and converted the sentence of death penalty to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment without remission. The court made it clear that the appellant-accused shall not be entitled to make any representation for remission till he completes 20 years of actual rigorous imprisonment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a removal order passed by the Disciplinary Authority on 28.09.1993 against a respondent-employee. The removal order was challenged by the respondent, and the matter went up to the Division Bench.
The Division Bench had set aside the removal order and restored the earlier order of removal passed in 1985. However, the appellants (Disciplinary Authorities) appealed against this judgment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants were based on the proposition that the charges against the respondent-employee were proved and that the punishment awarded was not arbitrary or perverse. They also argued that the Division Bench had erred in setting aside the removal order.
The respondent's learned counsel relied on the judgments rendered by the learned Single Judge and the Impugned Judgment to argue against the appellants' contentions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The charges against the respondent-employee were broadly proved based on official documentation, which was not controverted or denied by him.
* The Division Bench had erred in making a distinction between the earlier order of removal and the Removal Order passed subsequently.
* Minor deficiencies in the process did not cause prejudice to the respondent to the extent warranting judicial interdiction.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:
"The Impugned Judgment is quashed and set aside, and the Removal Order dated 28.09.1993 passed by the Disciplinary Authority is restored. Consequences in law to follow."
Additionally, the court exercised its discretion and decided that payments, if any, already made to the respondent in the interregnum shall not be recovered by the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the borrowers and a Bank over a loan transaction. The Bank had filed an FIR and chargesheet against the accused persons under Section 307 IPC, alleging that they had caused serious injuries to the Bank's officials. However, it was later revealed that the dispute was primarily civil in nature, concerning the loan transaction.
The parties had settled their disputes through a One-Time Settlement (OTS) scheme, where the borrowers paid an amount of Rs.3,80,00,000/- to the Bank.
The accused persons had also paid EMIs and sold mortgaged properties to repay the loan.
The dispute was later resolved in favor of the borrowers through a proceeding before the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court erred in not exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC to quash the criminal proceedings against them.
They contended that the dispute was predominantly civil in nature and that the parties had settled their disputes through an OTS scheme.
The appellants also argued that the possibility of conviction was remote and bleak, given the settlement between the parties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court has consistently held that criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominantly civil character should be quashed when the parties have resolved their disputes among themselves.
In this case, the High Court had refused to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC despite the settlement between the parties.
However, this Court took into consideration various factors, including the intervention of village elders and the decision of the parties to live peacefully in the future, before quashing the criminal proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This Court allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court.
The criminal proceedings against the appellants were also set aside.
The Court observed that the High Court ought to have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC to quash the criminal proceedings, given the settlement between the parties and the predominantly civil nature of the dispute.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the conviction of an individual in a murder trial. The prosecution had accused the appellant of murdering his wife and daughter. However, the defense argued that the evidence presented by the prosecution was not sufficient to prove the guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution's main arguments were based on the following points:
* The recovery of blood-stained clothes from the appellant's possession
* The recovery of jewelry and a mangalsutra that belonged to the deceased women
* The motive for the crime, as per the prosecution, was due to a family dispute
However, the defense argued that:
* The recovery of blood-stained clothes could not be linked to the crime scene beyond reasonable doubt
* The presence of blood-stains on the appellant's clothes was natural given his involvement in the investigation
* The recovery of jewelry and mangalsutra did not prove anything substantial
* The motive for the crime, as per the defense, was not sufficient to establish guilt
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The prosecution had failed to prove the guilt beyond reasonable doubt
* The evidence presented by the prosecution was insufficient to rule out other possible hypotheses
* The recovery of blood-stained clothes and jewelry did not meet the required standards for proof
* The motive, as per the defense, was not strong enough to establish guilt
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The appeal is allowed
* The judgment and order of the High Court dated 23rd July 2019 in Confirmation Case No. 2 of 2016 and the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 26th August 2016 and 31st August 2016 passed by the trial court in Sessions Case No.64 of 2013 are quashed and set aside
* The appellant is directed to be set at liberty if not required in any other case
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018, which was filed by the appellants seeking rectification of their name in the Register of Companies. The petition was initially dismissed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), but later allowed by the NCLAT. However, on appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the NCLAT and restored the petition to the file of the NCLT for consideration afresh.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they had paid ₹14,66,39,400/- to respondent No. 2, which was a significant amount, but it was not considered by the NCLAT while passing the judgment. They also argued that the signatures of two directors on the share certificates were sufficient in law and relied on Section 46 of the Act of 2013.
The respondents argued that the appellants had failed to provide original share certificates, which was a crucial piece of evidence, and therefore, their petition should be dismissed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The NCLT and NCLAT did not properly examine the issues raised before them, nor did they consider the documentary evidence placed on record. They also failed to labour over the actual issues for consideration, which resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
The Supreme Court observed that the judgments of the NCLT and NCLAT were not based on cogent conclusions and that the disputes raised by the respondents were mere moonshine.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment in Company Petition No. 667/59 & 241/HDB/2018 and the judgment in Company Appeal (AT) (CH) No. 44 of 2021 & I.A. No. 548 of 2021. The petition was restored to the file of the National Company Law Tribunal, Amaravati Bench, for consideration afresh on merits and in accordance with law.
The Court directed the NCLT to give priority to the case and endeavour to dispose it of as expeditiously as possible.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioners have invoked the arbitration clause under an agreement, and the respondents have raised objections against the present petition. However, none of the objections question or deny the existence of the arbitration agreement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's counsel has submitted that since the respondents have not denied the existence of the arbitration agreement, the requirement of prima facie existence of an arbitration agreement under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 is satisfied. The respondents' objections can be raised before the arbitral tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court has observed that the determination of whether a non-signatory party is bound by the arbitration agreement involves complexity and requires a detailed analysis of factual evidence and legal doctrine. Therefore, it would be appropriate for the arbitral tribunal to take a call on this question after considering the evidence adduced before it.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court has allowed the present petition and appointed Shri Justice Mohit S. Shah as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator, including other modalities, shall be fixed in consultation with the parties. All the rights and contentions of the parties are left open for adjudication by the learned arbitrator.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between an appellant and the respondent regarding interest rates. The Single Judge had earlier passed a judgment allowing the appellant to claim interest at the rate of 36% per annum, but this was challenged by the respondent before the Division Bench. However, the Division Bench passed another order (Second Impugned Order) setting aside its own previous order (First Impugned Order), which was again challenged by the appellant in this case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the respondent argued against the high interest rate of 36% per annum allowed by the Single Judge, leading to the Division Bench's order setting aside its own previous order.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The excessive interest rate of 36% per annum was considered on the higher side and reduced to 12% per annum in the interest of justice.
- A delay of 589 days in filing a petition against the First Impugned Order was condoned, subject to payment of costs of Rs.20,000/- by the appellant to the respondent.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:
- The appeals were allowed, and the Single Judge's judgment was restored with a slight modification, i.e., reduction in the interest rate from 36% per annum to 12% per annum.
- Simple interest will run at the rate of 12% per annum from June 24, 2000, till the date of realization.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an application for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. in a criminal trial. The respondent no. 1 had initially made an application for further investigation, which was rejected earlier. However, the same grounds were rehashed in the form of an application under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. in January 2020. The High Court allowed the petition for further investigation, but this decision was later reversed by the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the respondent no. 1's application for further investigation was based on certain grounds that were initially rejected. The State had opposed all previous applications up to the High Court but later turned turtle and supported the respondent no. 1 in the Supreme Court without providing a tenable justification.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the judges include:
- The speedy disposal of cases is essential for maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice.
- The courts must be vigilant in detecting attempts to delay proceedings and nip them in the bud instantly.
- Frivolous and vexatious proceedings can lead to delays in the disposal of other cases, which impinge on the rule of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 30.04.2021 in Criminal RC (MD) No. 533 of 2020 and dismissed the petition for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. Consequently, Cr. M.P. No 40/2020 in S.C. No. 61/2014 filed by the respondent no. 1 before the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge for further investigation under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C. would stand dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquisition of land by the government for the development of a residential area. The Reference Court had granted compensation to the land-owners at the rate of Rupees 92,62,500 per acre. However, the Land Acquisition Collector (LAC) and later the High Court reduced this amount. The land-owners appealed against these decisions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the land-owners is that the compensation granted by the Reference Court was reasonable and aligned with the evidence of sale deeds and potentiality of the land. They argue that the LAC and High Court erred in reducing this amount, which would result in undercompensation for the land-owners.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that there is a stark disparity between the size of the land covered by the sale exemplar and the acquired land. However, it also takes into account the various advantageous factors associated with the acquired land at the time of issuance of the Section 4 notification.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeals and sets aside the impugned leading judgment dated 23.08.2022 of the High Court, as well as all other judgments following the said leading judgment which are under challenge in this batch of appeals. The compensation amount granted by the Reference Court is hereby restored. The compensation amount, if already not paid, wholly or partly, as per the award of the Reference Court, shall be paid to the Appellants and other land-owners along with all the statutory benefits including interest, within eight weeks.

<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the quantified disability of a candidate seeking admission to educational institutions. The candidate has benchmark disability and is eligible for consideration, but the Disability Assessment Board (DAB) opines that the candidate cannot pursue the course due to their disability.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court holds that quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission. The DAB should positively record whether the disability of the candidate will or will not come in the way of pursuing the course, and state reasons in case of a negative opinion.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that many individuals with disabilities have achieved great heights despite their adversities, citing examples such as Sudha Chandran, Arunima Sinha, and Dr. Satendra Singh. The court also references the works of famous artists and musicians who were able to realize their full potential despite having disabilities.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
(i) Quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission to educational institutions.
(ii) The Disability Assessment Boards should positively record whether the disability of the candidate will or will not come in the way of pursuing the course, and state reasons in case of a negative opinion.
(iii) The DABs should keep in mind the salutary points mentioned in the communication of 25.01.2024 by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment while forming their opinions.
(iv) Decisions of the DABs which give a negative opinion for the candidate will be amenable to challenge in judicial review proceedings, with the court referring the case to a premier medical institute for an independent opinion.

The appeal is allowed, and the impugned order dated 29.08.2024 is set aside. The concerned authorities are directed to treat the admission of the appellant as valid.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a foreign national, Pranav, who is seeking to obtain Indian citizenship. Pranav's father had previously held Indian citizenship, but it was revoked due to his failure to renounce his original nationality. As a result, Pranav's citizenship by descent under the Citizenship Act of 1955 was also revoked.
Pranav later applied for citizenship through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019, which allows foreign nationals with a direct ancestral link to India to obtain Indian citizenship. However, his application was rejected.
Pranav then appealed to the High Court, which held that he had resumed Indian citizenship under Section 8(2) of the Citizenship Act of 1955. This ruling was challenged by the Central Government, leading to an appeal in the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* The petitioner's contention that Pranav had resumed Indian citizenship under Section 8(2) of the Citizenship Act of 1955 due to his direct ancestral link to India.
* The Central Government's argument that Pranav did not meet the criteria for resuming Indian citizenship, as he was not an ordinary resident in India for at least 12 months preceding the date of application.
* The petitioner's claim that the High Court's decision was incorrect and that Pranav should be granted Indian citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019.
* The Central Government's counter-argument that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 does not apply to Pranav, as he did not meet the criteria for obtaining citizenship through this route.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
* The court notes that the language used in the provisions of the Citizenship Act of 1955 is plain and simple, and should be given its ordinary and natural meaning.
* The court also observes that there is no scope for liberal interpretation of the statute, as it provides for the grant of citizenship to foreign nationals.
* The court further notes that Pranav can apply for Indian citizenship under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Citizenship Act of 1955, provided he meets the criteria specified in this provision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the Supreme Court is as follows:
* The court sets aside the impugned orders of the High Court and allows the appeal filed by the Central Government.
* The court dismisses Writ Petition (C) No.123 of 2024, which was filed by Pranav challenging the rejection of his application for citizenship.
* The court observes that Pranav can apply for Indian citizenship under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Citizenship Act of 1955, provided he meets the criteria specified in this provision.
* The court also notes that it is open to Pranav to apply to the Central Government for relaxation of the period of 12 months required for obtaining citizenship under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Citizenship Act of 1955.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to the judgment of the High Court of Karnataka at Kalaburagi, dated 03.03.2023, which acquitted an accused in a criminal liability arising out of dishonour of cheque.
The accused was charged under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
The case involved a dispute over a cheque bounced due to insufficient funds.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the trial court and the High Court erred in acquitting the accused, citing lack of evidence and faulty appreciation of facts.
The respondent-accused argued that the prosecution failed to establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that the courts below correctly acquitted him.
The appellant relied on various case laws to support their contention that the acquittal was perverse and against the principles of natural justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there is no perversity in the judgment of the High Court, as it is supported by a detailed appraisal of evidence and facts.
The concurrent findings of the trial court and the High Court do not warrant interference, as they are based on a thorough examination of the evidence presented by the accused.
The court underscored the principle of non-interference, unless the findings are perverse or bereft of evidentiary corroboration or lacks question of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the High Court, holding that there was no perversity in the acquittal and that the concurrent findings were based on a thorough examination of evidence.
The court relied on its previous judgments in similar cases, such as M/s Rajco Steel Enterprises v. Kavita Saraff and Another (2024 SCC OnLine SC 518), to support its decision not to interfere with the acquittal.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent, a high-calibre employee of the Company, submitted his resignation after feeling unfairly rated by the appellant. He had been subjected to unfair rating without any feedback or review for six months preceding his resignation. The respondent made a complaint to the Ombudsman regarding his unfair rating.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in this case are:

* Whether the respondent is a "workman" under the Industrial Disputes Act (ID Act) and thus eligible for reference to the Labour Court.
* Whether the respondent's resignation was voluntary or forced upon him by the Company.

The appellant argued that the respondent's duties do not entitle him to be placed under the cover of Section 2(s), ID Act. The respondent, on the other hand, asserted that he was one of the best performers and an asset to the Company.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Several observations were made by the Court:

* The language employed in the respondent's resignation letter indicates that it was voluntary, not forced.
* The fact that the respondent felt unfairly rated does not necessarily mean that his resignation was forced upon him by the Company.
* It would be far-fetched to assume that all superiors of the respondent turned against him.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the respondent is not a "workman" under the ID Act and thus, reference to the Labour Court against the appellant would not be maintainable. The impugned judgment as well as the judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge were set aside, and the judgment of the Labour Court was revived and restored.

The convict's counsel argued that the conditions imposed while granting remission must be reasonable. If the conditions are arbitrary, they will stand vitiated due to violation of Article 14 and may violate the convict's rights under Article 21 of the Constitution. The counsel also argued that the effect of remitting the sentence results in the restoration of liberty of a convict, and thus, this drastic power cannot be exercised without following the principles of natural justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that registration of a cognizable offence against the convict per se is not a ground to cancel the remission order. The allegations of breach of condition cannot be taken at their face value, and whether a case for cancellation of remission is made out will have to be decided in the facts of each case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court struck down the first part of condition no.1 regarding behaving decently as manifestly arbitrary. The undertaking given by the appellant and the surety bonds submitted by him stand cancelled only to that extent. Condition no.2 stands clarified in terms of this judgment. The order of remission shall not be revoked on the ground of breaches of conditions without compliance with the principles of natural justice. The Appeal is partly allowed on the above terms.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the High Court's decision to set aside an Arbitral Award with respect to claim nos. 3, 4, and 6. The Contract between the parties does not prohibit pre-reference interest.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the High Court had no reason to interfere with the Arbitral Award with respect to grant of pre-reference interest since the Contract between parties does not prohibit the same.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations from the case are:
* Pendente lite interest is a matter of procedural law, while pre-reference interest is governed by substantive law.
* The grant of pre-reference interest cannot be sourced solely in Section 31(7)(a), but must be based on an agreement between the parties (express or implied), statutory provision (such as Section 3 of the Interest Act, 1978), or proof of mercantile usage.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the High Court in setting aside the Award with respect to claim no. 3 and dismissed the Civil Appeal to this extent.

The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court in so far as it rejected and set aside claim no. 4 awarded by the Arbitrator, as upheld by the District Judge under Section 34.

The Supreme Court also allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court in so far as it modified claim no. 6, to the extent of rejecting pre-reference interest awarded by the Arbitrator, as upheld by the District Judge under Section 34.

In conclusion, Award of claim no. 3 is set aside and Award of claim no. 4 is upheld. Under claim no.6, the appellant will also be entitled to claim pre-reference interest.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves A-1, A-2, and A-3 who were found guilty of offences under sections 148, 302, and 307, IPC read with section 34 thereof. The High Court's decision was challenged by the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that there was no testimony of any independent witness despite the place of crime being surrounded by shops and residential houses. They also claimed that the testimonies of P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5 were not trustworthy and reliable.
However, the prosecution relied on the testimonies of P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5 which were deemed trustworthy and reliable. The appellants' argument was based on the absence of independent witness testimony.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's decision finding A-1, A-2, and A-3 guilty of offences under sections 148, 302, and 307, IPC read with section 34 thereof was upheld. The court observed that the prosecution's case could not be dismissed solely on the ground of the absence of independent witness testimony.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was dismissed as it was bereft of any merit. The High Court's decision was affirmed as correct and upheld. 
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the initiation of criminal proceedings against an individual. The individual was accused of offenses, but the competent authority refused to grant sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The High Court had also considered the matter and concluded that the lack of sanction vitiated the entire proceeding.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the trial court's decision to take cognizance of the offense without a valid sanction from the competent authority was incorrect. They also contended that the High Court erred in not considering the absence of a valid sanction and the subsequent denial by the competent authority.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case pertain to the interpretation of Section 197 of the CrPC, which deals with the grant of sanction for prosecution. The court observed that there is no concept of "deemed sanction" under this section and that a lack of decision within the specified time frame does not automatically result in a deemed sanction.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and quashed the chargesheet, summoning order, and all consequent steps taken by the trial court against the appellant. The judgment emphasized the importance of obtaining valid sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of the CrPC.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Central Excise Valuation Rules, 2000. The appellant, BPCL, challenged the orders of the Commissioner of Central Excise, Nashik, and the Tribunal. The main issue was whether the extended period of limitation could be invoked in this case.
The Revenue alleged that the MOU between the appellant and other companies was suppressed, which led to the invocation of Section 11AC. However, there was no allegation of fraud, collusion, or wilful mis-statement on the part of the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the Revenue argued in favor of invoking the extended period of limitation and applying Section 11AC due to the alleged suppression of the MOU. The appellant likely argued against this, citing the lack of allegations of fraud, collusion, or wilful mis-statement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Tribunal initially applied Rule 11 read with Rule 7 for valuation but later found that Rule 4 was the correct provision to be applied.
The extended period of limitation could not be invoked in this case as there were no allegations of fraud, collusion, or wilful mis-statement on the part of the appellant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Civil Appeal No.5642 of 2009 is hereby allowed. The impugned orders, including the order dated 8th December 2007 passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise, Nashik are hereby set aside.
In the remaining appeals, the impugned judgments are hereby quashed and set aside, and the appeals are remanded to the concerned Tribunals to decide the same in accordance with the law laid down in this judgment and accordingly, the appeals are partly allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The first respondent, a consumer of electricity, was served with show cause notices for non-payment of minimum guarantee charges. The first respondent challenged the demand in a writ petition. The court examined the contract between the parties and decided that the jurisdictional fact for demanding payment did not exist.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the orders dated 04th May, 2000, and 14th February, 2001, had attained finality and bound the first respondent. They also contended that even if the previous orders were wrongly decided, they still bind the party against whom they are decided.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that a point, even if wrongly decided, binds the party against whom it is decided, and the same point cannot be urged in a subsequent suit or proceeding at the same level. The issue of liability accruing to the first respondent had been decided previously and attained finality.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the second writ petition by the first respondent was not maintainable and should not have been entertained. Since the appellants accepted the order dated 16th July, 2009, and issued a fresh demand for a reduced amount, which has since been recovered, no order was made to change the position flowing from the said order. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court allowing the intra-court appeal were set aside with the result that the civil appeal stood allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two civil appeals (C.A.Nos. 9739-9740/2011) related to a dispute over the ownership of land in khata Nos. 98 and 99. The lessees, Abdul Ghafoor and Mohammad, had acquired the property through a lease deed dated 07.05.1922. The lessees' descendants were involved in a controversy regarding their respective shares in the land.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the authorities below had misdirected themselves by considering the acquisition of the property as joint family property. The court also noted that the concept of joint family property is prevalent amongst Hindus, but not amongst Muslims.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court held that the petitioners of writ petition No. 6635 of 1974 have a 1/12 share jointly in the plots comprised in khata Nos. 98 and 99 excluding plot Nos. 35, 37, 111, and 112 which exclusively belongs to Sami Ullah and his brother Badlu.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a husband and wife who are accused of murdering the wife. The prosecution alleged that both the mother-in-law and the husband were involved in the crime, but the defense argued that there was no evidence to implicate the husband. The incident occurred inside the family home, and the police found the body of the deceased with severe burns.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution relied on Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deals with acts done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention. They argued that since the mother-in-law had committed the crime, and the husband was present at the scene, he should also be held liable under this section.
The defense, however, contended that there was no evidence to show that the husband shared the same intention as his mother-in-law. They argued that the husband's presence at the scene did not necessarily imply his involvement in the crime.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that for Section 34 of the IPC to apply, both the common intention and participation must be established. In this case, although the common intention was proved, there was no evidence to show that the husband participated in the crime.
The court also noted that mere presence at the scene is not enough to imply involvement, and that the prosecution had failed to establish any connection between the husband and the actual act of murder.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court acquitted the husband of all charges, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to implicate him in the crime. However, the mother-in-law was held guilty of the alleged crime. The court also ordered the release of the husband from jail, as he had been wrongly imprisoned.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the applicability of Rule 21(8) of the Punjab VAT Rules and its relation to input tax credit. The respondent had earned input tax credit on purchase of iron and steel goods, which were kept as stock in trade for future use in manufacturing taxable goods. The State lowered the rate of tax on those goods with effect from 01.02.2014, but there was no corresponding provision in the parent statute that permitted availing of input tax credit at the lower rate on existing stock.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court held that prior to 01.04.2014, there was no statutory sanction to allow applicability of Rule 21(8) on the stock in trade i.e. on inputs already purchased for which transactions stood concluded at a higher rate of tax. The State argued that the enabling provision in the statute (first proviso to Section 13(1) of the Punjab VAT Act) came into force with effect from 01.04.2014, allowing the applicability of Rule 21(8).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the benefit of input tax credit is traceable to the statute and if it has to be reduced, which will have an adverse civil consequence upon the beneficiary, it must have the requisite statutory sanction. The Court also noted that under sub-section (9) of section 13, a person is under a mandate to reverse input tax credit availed by him on goods which could not be used for the purposes specified in sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Punjab VAT Act or which remained in stock at the time of closure of business.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the interpretation given by the High Court to the applicability of Rule 21(8) of the Punjab VAT Rules read with the amended first proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Punjab VAT Act is legally sound and warrants no interference. Consequently, the appeals were dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute regarding the share of a property. The property was inherited by Govindammal, and after her demise, the property was to be divided among her heirs. However, there was a disagreement about the proportion of shares that each heir should receive.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court's judgment overturning the concurrent findings of the courts below was incorrect. They contended that the High Court did not consider the principles regarding the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The appellants further argued that there were no substantial questions of law involved in this case, as per the recently summarized principles by this Court in Suresh Lataruji Ramteke v. Sau. Sumanbai Pandurang Petkar.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observation made was that Govindammal (now her heirs) is indeed entitled to 2/3rd share in the property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal succeeds, and the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside. The findings of the courts below are restored. The pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant-Corporation acquired land under Section 352 of the Act. The possession was allegedly taken in 1991, but no compensation has been paid as yet. The Corporation continued to accept property tax from the recorded owner until 2010.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the High Court are that:
- The acquisition under Section 352 of the Act is per se illegal and invalid.
- The Corporation acted blatantly in violation of statutory provisions by acquiring the property without approaching the State under Section 537(1) of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that:
- The Corporation's actions concerning the acquisition of property are clear contraventions to the provisions of the Act and should be quashed.
- The explanation offered by the Corporation for not paying compensation is unacceptable.
- The Corporation's record-keeping regarding possession and ownership was also flawed, leading to confusion about the actual ownership status.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the High Court is that:
- The appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 4504 of 2021 is dismissed with costs.
- Costs are quantified at Rs. 5,00,000/- to be paid to respondent no. 1 within sixty days from the date of the judgment.
- Any pending application shall be disposed of accordingly.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes and the applicability of the 'creamy layer principle' to these communities. The facts are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the matter pertains to the rights and benefits afforded to Scheduled Castes under the Indian Constitution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are centered around the validity of sub-classification within Scheduled Castes for the purpose of reservation. The Court is also deliberating on whether the 'creamy layer principle' should be applied to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Key points include:
* The Constitution's provision for reservation to ensure equality and justice.
* The need for empirical data to support sub-classification within Scheduled Castes.
* The application of the 'creamy layer principle' to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for full realization of substantive equality.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations from the case include:
* The Court's recognition that the Constitution has moved towards a casteless society, except for limited provisions related to reservation.
* The need for different criteria, such as economic or financial factors, status of living, vocation, and facilities available, to determine eligibility for reservations.
* The emphasis on periodic exercises to exclude individuals who have benefited from reservations and are now on par with the general category.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by Justice Pankaj Mithal states that sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is permissible in law for the purposes of reservation. However, the Court also emphasizes the need for empirical data to support such classification.

Additionally, Justice Satish Chandra Sharma's concurring opinion highlights the importance of identifying the 'creamy layer' within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to ensure full realization of substantive equality. He agrees with the validity of sub-classification but stresses that any exercise involving sub-classification must be supported by empirical data.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals against the impugned judgment of the High Court. The facts are not explicitly mentioned, but it appears that the judgments were related to specific performance of a contract and the execution of decrees.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
There is no explicit mention of arguments presented by either party in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the appellants argued against the High Court's judgment, while the respondents likely defended the judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations section does not contain any specific information about the case. However, the text mentions that the decision of this Court in Prem Jeevan (supra) was altogether in a different factual scenario and is of no avail to the appellants herein.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment is upheld, and the appeals are dismissed. The Court notes that merely because rescission of contract was not sought by the judgment debtor would not automatically result in extension of time. 
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant against the penalties imposed by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC) for non-compliance with consumer protection orders. The appellant had invoked insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), seeking to stay the regulatory penalties.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant include:
- Equating the moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC with the moratorium on Section 138, Negotiable Instruments Act proceedings
- Seeking to stay the regulatory penalties imposed for non-compliance with consumer protection laws as part of the insolvency proceedings
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The distinction between debt recovery proceedings and punitive actions needs to be created in the context of an insolvency moratorium
- Regulatory penalties cannot be stayed merely because insolvency proceedings are ongoing
- Staying regulatory penalties would be contrary to public policy and legislative intent behind consumer protection laws
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is as follows:
- The penalties imposed by the NCDRC are regulatory in nature and do not constitute "debt" under the IBC
- The moratorium under Section 96 of the IBC does not extend to regulatory penalties imposed for non-compliance with consumer protection laws
- The appeal is dismissed, and the appellant is directed to comply with the penalties imposed by the NCDRC within a period of eight weeks from the date of this judgment

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent was a prisoner in the Jharkhand prison. The Inspector General of Prisons issued an order on 17.05.2023 to transfer the respondent. However, the High Court set aside this order and directed the prison authorities to protect the respondent's life and fundamental rights.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the Inspector General of Prisons argued that the transfer of the respondent was necessary for their safety and well-being. On the other hand, the High Court may have argued that the order was arbitrary and did not consider the potential consequences for the respondent.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prison administration needs to be reformed to ensure that prisoners are treated with dignity and respect. The Model Prison Manual 2016 was introduced as a guideline for effective prison administration, but its implementation is unclear in Jharkhand. The court also noted that there have been repeated calls for prison reforms and the need for an independent oversight mechanism.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court set aside the High Court's order and restored the Inspector General of Prisons' order dated 17.05.2023. The authorities were directed to ensure that the respondent's life, basic, and fundamental rights are protected in accordance with law. Additionally, the State of Jharkhand was ordered to formulate or expedite the formulation of a Jail Manual incorporating the applicable provisions of the Model Prison Manual 2016 for effective prison administration.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a second appeal before the High Court, where an interim order was passed without formulating substantial questions of law. The respondents in the second appeal were not served, and notice was unserved qua Respondent Nos. 4, 6, and 7.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the High Court could not have passed the interim order without satisfying itself of the existence of a substantial question of law, as mandated under Section 100 CPC. The learned counsel for the respondent made an attempt to contend that the High Court has jurisdiction to pass any interim order and the order impugned herein is only an ad interim arrangement to protect the interest of the subject matter of the proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's power to pass an interim order ex parte does not empower it to grant ad interim relief without examining the parties and formulating substantial questions of law involved in the second appeal, as this is contrary to Section 100 CPC. The settled legal position requires that a second appeal will be maintainable before the High Court only if it is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the interim order passed by the High Court was not in accordance with the law and set aside the same. The appeal stands allowed, and there is no order as to costs. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a complaint filed by the respondent against the appellants, M/s. Bid & Hammer Auctioneers (P) Ltd., in connection with news articles published about an auction held on June 27, 2014.
The complainant alleges that the news articles lowered their reputation in the estimation of others and caused damage or loss to them.
The complaint was filed on August 22, 2014, more than a decade after the auction was conducted.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' counsel argued that there is no intent to defame or harm the complainant's reputation and that the news articles were published in public interest with good faith.
The learned counsel for the appellants also mentioned that similar criminal appeals bearing Nos. 1008/2022 etc. cases, arising from the same complaint filed by the same complainant, were allowed by this Court vide common order dated July 20, 2022.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court noted that the power of the media in shaping public opinion is significant and that a single article or report can resonate with millions, shaping their beliefs and judgments.
It was emphasized that publication of news articles must be done in public interest and with good faith.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This Hon'ble Court allows all these appeals and quashes the impugned order passed by the High Court and summoning orders as well as the criminal complaint filed by the respondent, as far as the appellants herein are concerned.
The connected Miscellaneous Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that tackling corruption is a priority task for the government and that legislative reforms and strict judicial actions have still not been able to completely uproot the deeply rooted evil of corruption.
The court noted that the spread of consumerism and fall in moral values have led to corruption taking deep roots in society.
The court also mentioned that people need to rise against bribery and corruption, and collectively resist it by any person, however high they may be.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court denied anticipatory bail to the petitioner, citing that the principles governing grant of anticipatory bail are distinct and different from those for regular bail.
The petition was dismissed, but the court clarified that a regular bail application would be considered on its own merits without being influenced by any observations made in this case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal investigation and trial, specifically the forgery of evidence in an NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) case. An FIR was registered after the acquittal in the original NDPS case. The proceedings were initiated nearly two decades ago.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court's interference in quashing the criminal proceedings was unwarranted, as it resulted from alleged forgery of evidence leading to an acquittal and subsequent FIR registration. The Appellate Court applied principles from earlier judgments (NDPS Act, 1985) to determine that a re-trial is not necessary.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
There were irregularities in the criminal investigation, specifically the alleged forgery of evidence leading to an acquittal and subsequent FIR registration. The High Court's interference was deemed unwarranted by the Appellate Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Appellate Court set aside the impugned order quashing the criminal proceedings in Crime No.215/1994, along with all further proceedings (C.C No 811 of 2014). The Trial Court was directed to conclude the trial within a year from the date of the judgment. The accused were required to appear before the Trial Court on a specified date.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between the original defendants/appellants and the respondents regarding a gift of property made by Sultan Saheb to his sons. The Mutation Entry, which is the primary evidence, does not explicitly state that it was a gift or that any title rests with the original defendants/appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the parties is related to the interpretation of the Mutation Entry and whether it constitutes a valid gift. The original defendants/appellants argue that the Mutation Entry is sufficient to establish their claim, while the respondents contend that the entry does not support this assertion.
The respondents also argue that for a gift to be valid, there must be a clear and unequivocal declaration of intention, which is absent in this case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the testimonies of the witnesses examined by the original defendants/appellants are vague and do not offer any relevant details regarding Sultan Saheb's intent.
The court also notes that the Mutation Entry does not support the claim of the original defendants/appellants, as it cannot be considered a gift or a transfer of title.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismisses the appeals and confirms the order passed by the Trial Court in O.S. No.140/88 and confirmed by the High Court in RFA No.469 of 1998, clubbed with RFA No.493 of 1998.
The court holds that the original defendants/appellants' claim of oral gift made by Sultan Saheb to his sons cannot be held to be a valid gift, as there is no clear and unequivocal declaration of intention in the Mutation Entry or any other evidence presented.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the auction of land by the Indore Development Authority (IDA). The respondent No. 1 was declared the highest bidder, but the IDA cancelled the auction due to an erroneous minimum rate in the Notice Inviting Tender (NIT). A second NIT was issued, but the respondent No. 1 did not participate.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:
* The IDA had the right to cancel the auction and issue a fresh NIT due to the erroneous minimum rate in the original NIT.
* The decision of the Tender Evaluation Committee to generate more revenues could not be interfered with.
* The bidder has no right in the matter of bid except for fair treatment and cannot insist on further negotiation.
* The IDA's action in cancelling the auction was arbitrary, as it did not provide any reason.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* In the absence of allotment letter and acceptance of highest bid, no relief could be granted to the respondent No. 1.
* The decision to cancel the auction was valid due to the erroneous minimum rate in the original NIT.
* The IDA's powers were not usurped by the Division Bench of the High Court, as they only intervened to ensure that the land is disposed of fairly and at a reasonable price.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside.
* A fresh NIT must be issued for the disposal of the land, enabling the IDA to generate more revenues.
* The appellant shall have the freedom to participate in the fresh NIT as and when issued by the IDA.
* The IDA shall not dispose of the land except through public auction or issuing a new NIT in future.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellant (Developer) entered into an agreement with the Respondents in 2014 for the sale of a flat. The Respondents paid 10% of the BSP (Basic Sale Price) as earnest money, which is considered reasonable by the NCDRC. The Respondents later sought cancellation of the allotment due to a sharp decline in prices.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellant argued that the forfeiture of earnest money was not a penalty but a legitimate deduction for breach of contract. The Respondents argued that they were entitled to refund of the excess amount paid and interest thereon.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court has held that if the forfeiture of earnest money under a contract is reasonable, it does not fall within Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The NCDRC has consistently taken the view that 10% of the BSP is a reasonable amount liable to be forfeited as earnest money.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court partly allowed the appeal and directed the Appellant to pay the balance amount of Rs.12,02,955/- to the Respondents within six weeks from today. The Court also held that the NCDRC was not justified in awarding interest on the amount to be refunded.
</JUDGMENT>

<FACTS>
The case involves a challenge to various provisions of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of different States, including Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. The petitioners have challenged these provisions in multiple writ petitions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioners are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that they challenge the validity of certain provisions under the respective Acts.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court has observed that the scheme of the respective Scheme Acts may be distinct and therefore, the petitioners should approach the respective State High Courts to assail the challenged provisions. The High Court has also noted that a more effective manner of ventilating the grievances would be to file writ petitions before the respective jurisdictional High Courts.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court has disposed of the writ petitions by reserving liberty to the petitioners to file their writ petitions before the respective High Courts. The High Court has also stated that if such writ petitions are filed, they could be considered having regard to various dimensions of the provisions in light of socio-economic, cultural, and religious aspects.

The case revolves around an arbitration dispute between two parties, with the Division Bench examining the correctness of a single judge's decision. The single judge had set aside an award made by an arbitrator under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:

*   The respondents (appellants) raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which deals with the powers of the court to enforce or set aside an arbitral award.
*   The appellants submitted that the single judge had correctly set aside the award as it was contrary to the terms of the contract between the parties.
*   The respondents (appellants) argued that the arbitrator had misinterpreted a crucial clause in the contract, resulting in an unjust and unreasonable award.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Division Bench observed that:

*   The scope of interference by a court in an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is restricted to ensuring that the exercise of power by the single judge has not exceeded the scope of Section 34.
*   The limited jurisdiction of the court under Section 34 permits intervention only when there is patent illegality or denial of natural justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Division Bench held that:

*   The appeal does not meet the grounds for interference under Section 37, as it involves an independent assessment of the merits of the award, which is beyond the scope of the court's jurisdiction under this provision.
*   As a result, the Division Bench dismissed the appeal, affirming the single judge's decision to set aside the arbitral award.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves allegations of witchcraft and violence against women. The background is that the accused persons are involved in a trial, and the court has received international reports and documents related to the issue of witch-hunting and violence against women. The court has also taken into account various legislations and judicial pronouncements on the subject.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court are based on the principle that "comments made hereinabove reflect only the heinousness of the crimes committed and do not in any way cast a shadow of guilt over the accused persons." The court has emphasized the importance of proceeding with the trial while keeping in view the principles but uninfluenced by any observations made in this judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that the matter is complex and requires careful consideration. The court has observed that the judgment impugned before them has been rendered null by subsequent withdrawal, but given the peculiarity of the situation and the vulgarity of the actions alleged, they have adopted a particular course.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment issued by the court is as follows:
(1) The matter is placed on the file of the concerned District Court to proceed in accordance with the law.
(2) The Trial against the accused persons shall proceed on a day-to-day basis.
(3) The accused persons are directed to appear before the Trial Court on 15th January 2025.
(4) It stands clarified that comments made hereinabove reflect only the heinousness of the crimes committed and do not in any way cast a shadow of guilt over the accused persons.
(5) The Trial shall proceed keeping in view the aforesaid principles but uninfluenced by any observations made in this judgment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the power of the State Transport Authority (STA) to delegate its functions, specifically regarding the issuance of non-stage carriage permits. The STA had delegated its powers to grant such permits to its Secretary, but this was challenged by private bus operators and the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC). The High Court had denied the delegation power, leading to appeals being filed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:

* The power of the STA to delegate its functions is explicitly provided for in Section 68(5) of the Motor Vehicles Act (MV Act), as well as Rule 56(1)(d) of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules (KMV Rules).
* Delegation is a necessary administrative measure to facilitate efficient processing of permit applications without undermining the oversight function of the STA.
* The High Court's reasoning on the non-delegability of permit-granting power was flawed.

The respondents argued that:

* The delegation of power would undermine the STA's control and lead to inefficiencies in the permit-issuance process.
* The liberalization of the regime for non-stage carriage permits aimed to improve public transport service delivery, which would be disrupted by delays caused by STA overload.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
No observations are explicitly mentioned in the provided case extract. However, it can be inferred that:

* The delegation of power is a rational and necessary administrative measure for efficient processing of permit applications.
* The appellants' arguments are supported by statutory provisions, making the High Court's reasoning on non-delegability flawed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:

* Section 3 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation and Certain Other Law (Amendment) Act, 2003, which repeals the Karnataka Contract Carriages (Acquisition) Act, 1976, is constitutional.
* The STA possesses the power to delegate its functions under Section 68(5) of the MV Act, as explicitly provided by the statute and further clarified by Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules.
* The appeals of the respondent corporation (KSRTC) are dismissed, while the appeals filed by private bus operators and the Karnataka State Road Transport Authority are allowed.
* The impugned orders of the High Court that denied the delegation power of the STA are set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a trial where the appellants were accused of committing a crime. The victim's body was found with 100% burns, leading to suspicion of murder or suicide. The prosecution presented circumstantial evidence, including statements from witnesses and expert opinions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence points to the guilt of the appellants. They cited the testimony of PW-7, an expert who stated that 100% burns could not be sustained in a case of suicide or self-immolation. The prosecution also highlighted inconsistencies in the defense's alibi and the delay in registering the FIR.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The courts below (Trial Court and High Court) had correctly appreciated the evidence on record, according to the judgment. The defense attempted to raise questions about specific pieces of evidence but were unable to challenge the overall consistency of the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the conviction of the appellants, holding that the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to prove their guilt. The defense's attempts to raise questions about specific pieces of evidence were deemed unsuccessful. The court noted that in cases based on circumstantial evidence, it is essential to examine all the proved circumstances collectively to arrive at a reasonable finding.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the classification of pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as 'edible oil'. The respondents, who marketed and sold the coconut oil during a specific period, were classified under Heading 1513 in Section III-Chapter 15 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. However, the respondents claimed that their product should be classified as 'hair oil' under Heading 3305 in Section VI-Chapter 33.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Revenue argued that the expression "for use" in the tariff schedule can only mean "intended for use" and not "actual use". They also relied on State of Haryana vs. Dalmia Dadri Cement Ltd., which interpreted a similar provision under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948.
On the other hand, the respondents relied on Dunlop India Ltd. vs. Union of India and others, where it was held that an article with a reasonable claim to be classified under an enumerated item in the Tariff Schedule should not be denied that classification and consigned to the residuary clause.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that when an article has a reasonable claim to be classified under an enumerated item in the Tariff Schedule, it would be against the principle of classification to deny it that classification. The court also emphasized the importance of certainty and consistency in the stand of the Revenue.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as 'edible oil' would be classifiable under Heading 1513 in Section III-Chapter 15 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. However, if the packaging satisfies all the requirements set out in Chapter Note 3 in Section VI-Chapter 33, it would be classified as 'hair oil' under Heading 3305.
The impugned orders were upheld, and the appeals were dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around a dispute between the Civil Supplies Corporation and the Rice Millers. The Corporation initiated recovery proceedings against the Rice Millers for unpaid amounts, claiming it as a "public demand" under the relevant Act. The Rice Millers challenged the proceedings, alleging procedural irregularities.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by both parties include:

*   The Civil Supplies Corporation claimed that the recovery proceedings were valid and justified, citing the provisions of the Act that define "public demand".
*   The Rice Millers argued that the initiation of proceedings was not in accordance with the procedure stipulated under the Act, violating procedural safeguards.
*   The Rice Millers also raised jurisdictional facts against realizing the sums as a public demand under the Act.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
Key observations made by the court include:

*   The availability of statutory remedies to aggrieved persons under the Act, which provides for procedures for filing, serving, and contesting recovery certificates.
*   The importance of exhausting these statutory remedies before invoking writ jurisdiction.
*   The court noted that procedural safeguards are in place under the Act to protect parties facing recovery actions.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court includes:

*   The Civil Appeals were dismissed, with the court upholding the validity of the recovery proceedings initiated by the Civil Supplies Corporation.
*   The court emphasized the importance of exhausting statutory remedies before invoking writ jurisdiction or appealing to higher courts.
*   The judgment granted 30 days for the Rice Millers to avail a statutory remedy, allowing them to challenge the recovery proceedings without reference to delay or limitation.

The final order was that the civil appeals stand dismissed with no order as to costs.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of accused-appellants under Section 302 and 304 Part I of IPC for a murder that took place on February 2, 1997. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence, including:
- Last seen by the deceased
- Recovery of a meat bag from near the spot
- Accused-appellants walking on the pathway near Mohan Singh’s shop in the night
- Accused-appellants inquiring about the deceased in the evening of 2.2.1997
A disclosure statement was also made, leading to the recovery of a stone and other objects that allegedly caused the fatal injury.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the circumstantial evidence collectively proved the guilt of the accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt. They contended that the accused-appellants' actions on the night of February 2, 1997, were incriminating and pointed towards their involvement in the crime.
The defense, on the other hand, challenged the admissibility of the disclosure statement and argued that it did not lead to any discovery. They also contended that the forensic report and Doctor's (PW-1’s) statement could not connect the recovered objects with the crime.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution failed to test the evidence on record to find out whether the incriminating circumstances were proved beyond reasonable doubt. The court also noted that the circumstance of accused-appellants walking on the pathway near Mohan Singh’s shop in the night was not even proved beyond reasonable doubt.
Additionally, the court pointed out that the disclosure statement was not admissible as it did not lead to any discovery. The recovered objects were allegedly recovered even before the disclosure statement was recorded.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and acquitted the accused-appellants of the charges for which they had been tried and convicted. The impugned order was set aside, and their bail bonds stood discharged.
The court held that no case was made out to hold the appellants guilty due to the failure of the prosecution to establish the chain of incriminating circumstances beyond reasonable doubt. The court also noted that the accused-appellants were entitled to be acquitted in a case based on circumstantial evidence where no effort was made to take a plea or lead evidence to show that their act would fall under any exception to Section 300 IPC.

<FUNCTONALITY IS LIMITED TO THE PROVIDED TEXT AND MAY NOT COVER ALL POSSIBILITIES. ANY RESULTS SHOULD BE REVIEWED BY A LEGAL PROFESSIONAL FOR ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS>

<FACTS>
The appellant joined the post of Ophthalmic Assistant on 06.03.1985 and was terminated from service after a police verification report was filed in 2010, 25 years after his initial appointment. The respondents admitted to an inordinate delay in submitting the verification report but did not provide any valid reason for it.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's termination order was set aside by the Tribunal due to the lack of adherence to principles of natural justice and failure to afford him an opportunity to explain his case. The High Court, however, allowed the writ petition filed by the State, holding that the action of issuing a show-cause notice and inviting a reply from the appellant was in accordance with the principles of natural justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Tribunal's order was correct in setting aside the termination order due to the non-adherence to principles of natural justice. The delay by the respondents in submitting the police verification report rendered the appellant ineligible for his pensionary benefits despite 26 years of unblemished service. The second limb of the Tribunal's order, which granted liberty to the authority to proceed against the appellant after a period of 14 years from his retirement, would not serve any purpose.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the order of the High Court is set aside. The service benefits that remain unpaid as on date be paid to the appellant within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. There is no order as to costs.

<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the accused, Nandkumar Babulal Soni, against his conviction and sentence under Sections 120B and 411 of the IPC. The seizure of gold bars from the accused's premises was a key aspect of the case. The prosecution claimed that the seized gold bars were stolen property, but the identity of the stolen property has not been established.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant include:
* The prosecution failed to establish the identity of the seized gold bars as stolen property.
* The delay in recovering the property has weakened its identification.
* The invocation of Section 114 of the Evidence Act is not permissible due to the weakness in the defence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The prosecution failed to discharge its initial burden and positively complete the chain of circumstances against the accused.
* The delay in recovering the property has raised doubts about its identification.
* The accused's failure to offer a reasonable explanation for the seized gold bars is not sufficient to establish their connection to the stolen property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court states:
* The appeals preferred by the appellant-Nandkumar Babulal Soni are allowed, and his conviction and sentence under Sections 120B and 411 of the IPC are set aside.
* The seized gold bars (205 in number) will be handed over to the appellant-Nandkumar Babulal Soni.
* Criminal Appeal No. 584 of 2012 preferred by Vijaya Bank stands dismissed, as the identity of the seized property being the stolen property has not been established.

<FACTS>
The Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order 2012 was issued under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006. The petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution to examine the nature of rights created by the Procurement Order 2012 and the remedies available to stakeholders.
The petitioner sought directions to the authorities to implement mandatory procurement from MSEs and to declare the limits of minimum turnover clauses with respect to MSEs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the petitioner's arguments were centered around:
The need for effective implementation of the Public Procurement Policy for MSEs Order 2012
The requirement for mandatory procurement from MSEs to promote their growth and development
The necessity for declaring limits of minimum turnover clauses with respect to MSEs to prevent unfair practices.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
The Public Procurement Policy for MSEs Order 2012 has the force of law as it is formulated in exercise of power under Section 11 of the Act and encapsulates the purpose and object of the Act
There is no mandatory minimum procurement 'right' for an individual MSE, but there is a statutorily recognized obligation on authorities to implement the mandate
The judicial review will primarily ensure proper constitution and effective functioning of authorities under the Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed:
(a) The Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order 2012 has force of law as it is formulated in exercise of power under Section 11 of the Act and also encapsulates the purpose and object of the Act.
(b) Though there is no mandatory minimum procurement 'right' for an individual MSE, there is certainly a statutorily recognized obligation on the authorities and the bodies under the Act to implement the mandate which is subject to judicial review.
(c) The judicial review will primarily ensure proper constitution and effective functioning of the authorities, namely the National Board for MSMEs, the Advisory Committee, the Facilitation Council, the Review Committee, and the Grievance Cell, and leave the policy and decision-making to them.
(d) The respondents, including the Review Committee, shall examine the issue of mandatory procurement of 25 per cent of goods and services by the Government and its instrumentalities from MSEs under clause 3 of the Policy within a period of 60 days from the date of our order.
(e) The respondents, including the Review Committee and in particular the Grievance Cell, shall examine and declare limits of the minimum turnover clauses with respect to MSEs and issue appropriate policy guidelines within a period of 60 days from the date of our order.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a Corporate Debtor, SRA Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., which had submitted a Resolution Plan to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. The plan was approved by the NCLAT in August 2020 but has seen no progress since then. The SRA has infused Rs. 200 Crore into the Corporate Debtor, and the lenders/creditors have a Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs. 150 Crore furnished by the SRA.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (lenders/creditors) argued that the Resolution Plan was approved without ensuring its feasibility or implementation. They claimed that the NCLAT's order led to further complications and allowed the Corporate Debtor to continue its inaction, causing significant losses to the lenders/creditors.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the impugned order passed by the NCLAT was perverse and unsustainable in law. The delay of almost five years since the Resolution Plan's approval has caused a substantial loss to the lenders/creditors. The Court noted that there is often a shortage of members in the Tribunals (NCLTs and NCLAT) and inadequate infrastructure, which heavily impacts the insolvency reform initiative.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, setting aside the impugned order passed by the NCLAT. The Court invoked its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution and directed that the Corporate Debtor be taken into liquidation. The NCLT, Mumbai was ordered to take appropriate steps for the appointment of a liquidator and commencement of liquidation. The amount of Rs. 200 Crore infused by the SRA stands forfeited, and the lenders/creditors are permitted to encash the Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs. 150 Crore furnished by the SRA.

<FACTS>
The appellants approached the High Court seeking a refund of Rs. 28,10,000/- which was retained by the respondents for a long time. The Single Judge of the Delhi High Court directed the respondents to pay interest on the amount.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned Single Judge took the view that the respondents could not decline to refund the amount and that the retention of the said amount was for a long time. The appellants were left with no other option but to approach the High Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the State having received the money without right and having retained and used it, is bound to make the party good, just as an individual would be under like circumstances. The obligation to refund money received and retained without right implies and carries with it the right to interest.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the respondents to pay an amount of Rs. 4,35,968/- (Rs. Four Lakh Thirty Five Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty Eight Only) towards interest within a period of two months from today without fail. The appeal stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the alleged murder of a girl named Marjina, and the accused is her cousin. The prosecution's case relies on circumstantial evidence, with several witnesses testifying to the events leading up to the crime.
The deceased was allegedly taken away by the accused, and later found dead. The prosecution presented several witnesses, including family members and neighbors, who testified to seeing the accused with the deceased on the day of the incident.
The defense argued that there was no direct evidence linking the accused to the crime, and that the prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution presented several arguments in support of their case:
- The accused had a motive to kill the deceased, as they were cousins who had been arguing over money.
- Several witnesses testified to seeing the accused with the deceased on the day of the incident.
- The accused's family members and neighbors also testified to suspicious behavior by the accused around the time of the crime.
The defense argued that:
- There was no direct evidence linking the accused to the crime, and that the prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence.
- The motive for the crime was not proven, as there was no clear indication of why the accused would want to kill the deceased.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, which is often unreliable and subject to interpretation.
- The absence of motive in this case weighed in favor of the accused, as it suggested that there was no clear reason for the crime to have been committed.
- The non-examination of material witnesses, including the accused's mother and brother-in-law, who had a potential interest in the case, further weakened the prosecution's case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately ruled in favor of the accused, acquitting them of all charges. The judgment states that:
- The prosecution failed to prove each of the circumstances against the accused, and that the courts below were not justified in convicting the accused.
- The complete absence of motive assumed a different complexion and weighed in favor of the accused.
The court allowed the criminal appeal, set aside the judgments of the High Court and Sessions Court, and acquitted the appellant of all charges.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the death sentence imposed on the accused under Section 302 IPC, along with other charges under Sections 364, 377 of IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the POCSO Act. The accused was found guilty of kidnapping a minor girl and subjecting her to sexual abuse. The trial court had sentenced the accused to death under Section 302 IPC, simple imprisonment for 10 years and a fine of Rs.10,000/- for offence under Section 364, and life imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/- for offence under Section 6 of the POCSO Act.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the accused's counsel are not explicitly mentioned in the given case. However, it can be inferred that the defence team argued against the imposition of the death sentence and sought a reduction in the sentence.
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the normally accepted norm for imprisonment is 14 years, but this was found to be grossly disproportionate on the lower side. The court applied this principle and held that a sentence of imprisonment for a period of 25 (twenty-five) years without remission would be 'a just dessert' for the convict.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court set aside the death sentence for the offence under Section 302 and substituted it with rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 (twenty-five) years without remission. The court also ordered that the sentence imposed for offences under Section 364 IPC (10 years S.I. and Rs. 10,000/- fine) and Section 6 of the POCSO Act (life imprisonment and Rs.10,000/- fine) shall run concurrently with the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of 25 years without remission.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant against his conviction and sentence in a criminal trial. The appellant was charged with various offences, but the specific charges are not mentioned in the extract. The case involved the provision of legal aid to the appellant, which was deemed inadequate.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument made in the case is that the legal aid provided to the appellant was ineffective and resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The court notes that the legal aid advocates appointed to espouse the cause of the appellant lacked good knowledge of criminal laws, law of evidence, and procedural laws.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that effective legal aid is essential for ensuring a fair trial and upholding the rights of an accused person under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court also notes that the provision of legal aid must be monitored to ensure that it is provided effectively.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the impugned judgments and orders are set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the offences alleged against him. The bail bonds of the appellant stand cancelled. A copy of the judgment is directed to be forwarded to all State Legal Services Authorities to enable them to take necessary measures.

The case concerns a criminal appeal (Criminal Appeal No. 5387/2024) filed by Athar Parwez against the High Court of Judicature at Patna's decision in CRADB No. 516/2023.
The matter was called for pronouncement of judgment on December 17, 2024.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not specified in the provided information.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the High Court's impugned order dated November 28, 2023, was set aside due to procedural irregularities.
The court also noted that the petitioner had been directed to be produced before the Special Court within a maximum period of seven days from December 17, 2024.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
In terms of the signed Reportable Judgment, the appeal was allowed with a direction that the Appellant (Athar Parwez) be enlarged on bail on appropriate terms and conditions to be fixed by the Special Court.
The operative portion of the judgment reads: "In the light of the above, the impugned judgment is set aside. The Appeal is accordingly allowed with a direction that the Appellant be enlarged on bail on the appropriate terms and conditions to be fixed by the Special Court."
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The accused was convicted of a crime, but the conviction was based on circumstantial evidence. The prosecution's case relied on three links of circumstantial evidence: (1) the alleged disclosure by the accused to the Investigating Officer, (2) the recovery of incriminating articles from the accused's house, and (3) DNA profiling matching the recovered skeletal remains with the blood of the deceased's mother.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the circumstantial evidence established a chain of events linking the accused to the crime. However, the defense challenged the reliability of this evidence, pointing out inconsistencies in the Investigating Officer's testimony and the lack of direct evidence linking the accused to the crime scene.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Investigating Officer's testimony was crucial in establishing the first link of circumstantial evidence. However, the officer did not mention that the accused accompanied him and panch witnesses to point out and recover the skeletal remains. This led the court to conclude that the alleged disclosure by the accused was not proven as per law.
Additionally, the court noted that the recovery of incriminating articles from the accused's house was also not directly linked to the accused. The Investigating Officer testified that it was the accused who led them to the place where the currency notes were recovered, but there was no mention of the accused leading them to the crime scene.
The court also observed that the DNA profiling report relied on by the prosecution was based on questionable evidence. PW-1 did not testify that her blood sample was collected during the investigation, and Dr. Syed Irshad, Medical Officer (PW-15), did not state that he collected the blood samples of PW-1.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that none of the incriminating circumstances portrayed by the prosecution were established by cogent and clinching evidence. As a result, the conviction of the accused was unsustainable. The impugned judgments were quashed and set aside, and the accused was acquitted of the charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves three accused-appellants, Nusrat Parween/appellant No. 1, Ahmad Khan/appellant No. 2, and Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3, who were charged with various offenses related to the disappearance of Hamida Parween/deceased.
Hamida Parween's husband had passed away, and after his death, there were allegations that the accused persons were quarreling with her for usurping the entire Holding No. 13.
The first informant, Md. Firoj/PW4, alleged in the FIR that the accused persons had quarreled with Hamida Parween/deceased in the morning of the incident and were seen fleeing away together in a tempo.
However, there was no evidence to support these allegations, and the prosecution story was found to be doubtful due to the indifference of the family members in taking any measures after being informed about the missing of Hamida Parween/deceased and noticing the lock on the door of the house.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to prove the chain of incriminating circumstances against the accused-appellants by convincing evidence and beyond the shadow of doubt, so as to affirm their guilt.
The trial Court and the High Court erred while appreciating the evidence and in holding that the prosecution has proved the case against the accused-appellants beyond all manner of doubt.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The maternal family relatives of Hamida Parween/deceased came out with a categoric assertion that after the death of Hamida Parween's husband, the accused persons were continuously quarreling with her for usurping the entire Holding No. 13.
The first informant, Md. Firoj/PW4, did not bring the station diary entry on record which was made in the station diary at Serial No. 517, and this was considered as another circumstance that persuaded the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The accused-appellants were acquitted of the charges by giving them the benefit of doubt.
The impugned judgment dated 19th January, 2011 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and judgments and orders dated 25th November, 2003, and 1st December, 2003 passed by the trial Court were hereby reversed and set aside.
Nusrat Parween/appellant No. 1 and Ahmad Khan/appellant No. 2 were on bail, and they need not surrender. Their bail bonds were discharged.
Abdul Rahman Khan/accused No. 3 was also to be released forthwith if he was in custody and not wanted in any other case.
The appeals were allowed accordingly, and the pending application(s), if any, stood disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a brutal murder, and the appellants were accused of involvement in the crime. The prosecution's evidence was based on circumstantial evidence, but it was not sufficient to prove the appellants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense argued that the prosecution had failed to present legally admissible evidence to prove the appellants' guilt. They pointed out that the confessional statements made by the accused to police officers while in custody were not admissible as evidence, except to the extent covered by Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution's case was weak and relied heavily on circumstantial evidence. The court also noted that the appellants' guilt had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further stated that in cases involving brutal crimes, it is tempting to convict an accused based on strong suspicions, but this must be avoided.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and acquitted the appellants. The judgments of the Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court were set aside, and the appellants were ordered to be released from prison unless required in connection with any other offense.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over a property, with the plaintiffs seeking an interim injunction to restrain the defendants from creating further encumbrances on the property. The property is the subject of a pending suit between the parties, and the plaintiffs have already obtained an order for status quo.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiffs' counsel argued that the doctrine of lis pendens under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act does not provide all the panacea against pendente lite transfers. They cited Rule 1 of Order 39 of the Code, which provides for interim injunction restraining alienation or sale of the suit property.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the property should not change hands any further, given the nature of dispute between the parties and the materials on record. The court also noted that the doctrine of lis pendens is not a complete defense against pendente lite transfers.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. The respondents herein shall maintain status quo as regards the suit property as on date and shall not create any further encumbrances over the same in any manner. Any further transfer of the suit property pending the final disposal of the suit shall be subject to lis pendens under Section 52 of the T.P. Act irrespective of the fact whether such lis pendens has been duly registered by the plaintiffs with the competent authority or not.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves criminal proceedings against two appellants, Geddam Jhansi and Geddam Sathyakama Jabali. The complainant is the wife of one of the principal accused, and the marriage took place in Pondicherry. However, the appellants do not live with the principal accused or the complainant's husband and mother-in-law, who reside in Chennai.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellants are:
* The evidence against them is based on generalized allegations without specific details.
* They do not stay together with the complainant and her husband, making it unjust to hold them as co-accused for alleged offenses committed in the matrimonial house of the complainant.
* Allowing the criminal proceedings against them would amount to an abuse of the process of law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The appellants have been able to make out a case for interference in these proceedings qua them, as no prima facie case has been made out against them.
* The evidence of the complainant and other witnesses does not disclose anything new about the appellants.
* The appellants' residence is in Hyderabad, while the principal accused and the complainant's family reside in Chennai.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed both criminal appeals:
* Set aside the impugned judgments and orders passed by the single bench of the High Court for the State of Telangana.
* Quashed the criminal proceedings against the two appellants qua them under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
* Also quashed the criminal proceeding in DVC No. 25 of 2021 pending before the Additional Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Bhongir, qua the second appellant, Geddam Jhansi.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an e-auction of a secured asset, where the respondent participated and bid for the asset. However, he failed to deposit the balance amount within the specified period, citing demonetization as a reason.
The respondent also claimed that the appellant bank failed to provide certain documents in time, which affected his ability to secure a term loan.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the respondent's case was that he was unable to make the balance payment due to extraneous circumstances (demonetization) and lack of documents from the appellant bank.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that demonetization had occurred before the e-auction was conducted, making it an extraneous circumstance beyond the respondent's control. However, this did not constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting judicial interference.
The court also noted that the sale was confirmed on 07.12.2016, and the respondent requested for documents only on 20.12.2016, which were provided to him within a month's time.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court committed an egregious error in passing the impugned judgment and order. The court set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court dated 27.10.2021. As a result, the SA No. 143 of 2018 filed by the respondent before the DRT-II also stands dismissed.
The appeals filed by the bank succeed and are hereby allowed. The parties shall bear their own costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Vihaan Kumar, the appellant, who was arrested by the police. The grounds of arrest were not communicated to him in writing, as required under Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India and Section 50 of the CrPC (Section 47 of BNSS). The appellant's family members were also not informed about the arrest.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the failure to communicate the grounds of arrest in writing rendered his arrest illegal. He relied on Article 22(1) of the Constitution, which mandates that a person arrested must be informed of the grounds of arrest in writing. The appellant also pointed out that Section 50A of the CrPC requires communication of the arrest to friends, relatives, or such other persons nominated by the arrested person.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the requirement of communicating the grounds of arrest is not merely a formality but has a meaningful purpose. It enables the detained person and their relatives to take immediate action to secure release on bail at the earliest opportunity, thereby actualizing the fundamental right to liberty and life under Article 21 of the Constitution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the failure to communicate the grounds of arrest in writing renders an arrest illegal. The court emphasized that the requirement is not only for the benefit of the arrested person but also to enable their relatives or nominated persons to take prompt action to secure release on bail.
</JUDGMENT>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations provided in the case discuss when interference with concurrent findings of fact is justified. According to the court, such interference can be made if one of the following scenarios applies:
- The findings cause undue hardship to the parties.
- The conscience of the court is shocked.
Additionally, the court emphasizes that its plenary power should be used sparingly and only when grave injustice is being caused to the parties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upholds the minority view in Mary Cheriyan (supra) but clarifies that it shall apply prospectively. Any transaction concluded or ongoing will not be disturbed by this judgment, and the position of law as stated herein shall apply only henceforth. The appeal stands dismissed, and the preliminary decree passed by the Trial Court is affirmed.

<Facts>
The case involves the sale of nitrous oxide by petitioners/accused to accused No.3 and No.4 without producing a license, despite accused No.3 firm having permission for manufacturing nitrous oxide and oxygen. The petitioners were also given a license to manufacture nitrous oxide. 
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented is that the petitioners/accused have sold the drug in contravention of the Act and Rules, making them liable to be prosecuted under Section 18(a)(vi) r/w Section 27 of the Act. The High Court's interpretation of Section 3(f) of the Act was challenged as being unsustainable in law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The learned Single Judge of the High Court misdirected itself by not considering the plain nature of Section 3(f) of the said Act, leading to an unsustainable interpretation. The issuance of process against the petitioners/accused lacked application of mind.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. The summoning order dated 20th January 2018, passed by the Trial Court in C.C. No. 71 of 2018, and the proceedings arising therefrom were also quashed and set aside.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the recruitment process for certain posts, which was initiated through an advertisement dated 29th July, 2010. The respondents had issued notifications and conducted selection processes based on this advertisement. However, the appellants challenged these proceedings in the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellants are as follows:
- The recruitment process was violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
- The advertisements issued were not compliant with the extant rules and regulations.
- The selection processes conducted under these advertisements were arbitrary and capricious.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the appellants had raised no challenge to the illegality of the recruitment process in their earlier proceedings before the Courts below. This was a new ground taken by the appellants for the first time before this Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
- The Court observed that public employment processes must always be fair, transparent, impartial, and within the bounds of the Constitution of India.
- Every citizen has a fundamental right to be treated fairly and impartially, which is an appendage of the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
- A violation of this guarantee is liable to judicial scrutiny as well as criticism.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court issued the following directions:
i. The advertisement dated 29th July, 2010, and all consequential proceedings conducted in pursuance thereof are hereby quashed for being violative of Articles 14 and 16 and judicial precedents of this Court.
ii. All appointments made in furtherance of the direction of the High Court dated 12th September, 2018, with respect to the subject posts are quashed.
iii. The respondent-State shall issue a fresh advertisement, compliant with the constitutional mandate and in accordance with the extant Rules and the observations made hereinabove. Thereafter, the recruitment process shall be re-conducted in accordance with law for the subject posts.
iv. In the interest of justice, we direct that the fresh notification shall be issued within six months from today and will specifically provide suitable age relaxation to accommodate all such aspirants who would have crossed the age limit during the pendency of the present litigation.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 who purchased the suit property during the pendency of a specific performance suit against the original owner (transferor). The sale transactions were executed while an injunction was operating against the transferor.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
No explicit arguments are mentioned in the provided case extract. However, it can be inferred that the court's judgment is based on its analysis of previous judgments and relevant laws.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the lis pendens transferee (Respondent Nos. 1 and 2) did not have a good case for grant of leave to appeal, given their purchase of the property during the pendency of the suit while an injunction was in place against the transferor.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes that:

i. The impleadment of a transferee pendente lite depends on the facts and circumstances, allowing them to come on record under Order I Rule 10 CPC or Order XXII Rule 10 CPC as a general principle.

ii. A transferee pendente lite is not entitled to come on record as a matter of right.

iii. There is no absolute rule that such a transferee pendente lite should be allowed to come on record with the leave of the court in all cases.

iv. The impleadment of a transferee pendente lite depends on the nature of the suit and appreciation of the material available on record.

v. Where a transferee pendente lite does not ask for leave to come on record, it would be at their peril, and the suit may be improperly conducted by the plaintiff on record.

vi. Merely because such a transferee pendente lite does not come on record, they are still bound by the judgment, though unrepresented.

vii. The sale transaction pendente lite is hit by the provisions of Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act.

viii. A transferee pendente lite can seek leave to come on record on their own or at the instance of either party to the suit.

The court allows the appeals, sets aside the impugned order passed by the High Court, and permits Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to avail appropriate legal remedies for recovery of sale consideration paid.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, a Director of an Institute, was charged with offenses punishable under Sections 269, 270, and 504, IPC. The chargesheet alleged that the appellant had reprimanded a subordinate, which was considered an "intentional insult" meant to provoke the complainant. However, the appellant claimed that his actions were taken to maintain discipline in the workplace.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellant's strict demeanor and tendency to maintain discipline could be reasonably attributed to mean an "intentional insult with the intent to provoke" within the means of Section 504, IPC. The prosecution also submitted that allowing criminal charges against the Director for trying to maintain discipline may lead to disastrous consequences crippling the disciplinary atmosphere required in the workplace.
The defense argued that the appellant's act of reprimanding the complainant was not an "intentional insult" meant to provoke her to commit a breach of peace or any other offense. The defense also contended that senior's admonition should not be reasonably attributed to mean an "intentional insult with the intent to provoke" within the means of Section 504, IPC, provided that the admonition relates to matters incidental to the workplace covering discipline and the discharge of duties therein.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the prosecution's interpretation may lead to a gross misuse of liberty in workplaces. The court also noted that allowing criminal charges against the Director for trying to maintain discipline could have disastrous consequences crippling the disciplinary atmosphere required in the workplace.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment dated 3rd May, 2024, was quashed and set aside. The impugned chargesheet being CC No. 1771 of 2022 for offenses punishable under Sections 269, 270, and 504, IPC filed before the Court of learned XI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Hyderabad was also quashed. All the proceedings sought to be taken thereunder against the appellant were hereby quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal appeal against the order of the High Court, which declined to quash the criminal proceedings against the appellants under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The complainant had lodged an FIR against the appellants under Section 498A of the IPC, alleging cruelty and harassment. The appellants filed a petition for quashing the criminal proceedings, but the High Court dismissed their plea.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the allegations made by the complainant were vague and generalized, and there was no prima facie case against them. They also contended that the High Court erred in not considering the allegations to be false at the very least, as per the principles laid down in the case of Bhajanlal (supra). The appellants further argued that the continuance of the criminal proceedings would result in an abuse of process of law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there had been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife. The court also noted that making vague and generalized allegations during matrimonial conflicts can lead to the misuse of legal processes.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the High Court should have exercised its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash the criminal proceedings. The court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the impugned judgment and order, and also quashed the criminal proceedings against the appellants in FIR No. 339 of 2018 and Final Report No. 10 of 2021.

<FACTS>
The case involves an investigation and trial under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The second accused, a Minister, allegedly sanctioned grants for fishing rights on an upset price without following the tendering process as per the state policy. This was done despite the policy requiring a tender process to be adopted in non-tribal areas.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's counsel argued that there is not even an iota of material available from the investigation report, pre-charge statements, or statements of persons questioned by the investigation team to attract the ingredients of the provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The counsel contended that the charges against the second accused/appellant do not include any allegation of demand and acceptance of bribe.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there is no material available from the investigation report, pre-charge statements, or statements of persons questioned by the investigation team to attract the ingredients of the provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court also noted that even if the grants have been made in non-tribal areas, the ingredients of the offences alleged under the Prevention of Corruption Act are absent.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and directed that the proceedings initiated against the second accused be dropped. The court stated that there is not even an allegation of demand and acceptance of bribe by the second accused/appellant, which is a necessary ingredient for the Prevention of Corruption Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal against the orders of the High Court and the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court had passed an order of discharge in a criminal case, which was stayed by the High Court. The stay order was passed ex-parte, and the accused was directed to be taken into custody. However, before the stay order, the Sessions Court had granted bail to the accused under Section 437A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The validity of this bail is now in question.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the appellant are that:
- The ex-parte stay order passed by the High Court was illegal and should be set aside.
- The direction to take the accused into custody was also unlawful.
- The bail bonds furnished by the accused under Section 437A of the CrPC were valid and still in force, and there is no reason for the accused to be taken into custody.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observes that:
- The ex-parte stay order passed by the High Court was illegal and had drastic consequences.
- The Sessions Court had exercised its power under Section 437A of the CrPC in granting bail to the accused, but this has now become invalid due to the passage of time.
</Observations>

<Judgment>
The court holds that:
- The ex-parte stay order passed by the High Court is quashed and set aside.
- The direction to take the accused into custody is also set aside.
- The bail bonds furnished by the accused under Section 437A of the CrPC are considered invalid due to their expiration, but the accused is directed to furnish fresh bail under Section 390 of the CrPC.
- The Sessions Court is directed to admit the accused to bail on such terms and conditions as may be fixed by it. The High Court is also directed to decide the revision application without being influenced by any observations made in this judgment.
</Judgment>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) was established by the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India. The third respondent was appointed as Chairperson despite not having the requisite experience. The appointment was made in violation of the statutory requirements and public advertisement process.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the appointment of the third respondent was illegal and arbitrary, as it departed from the mandatory eligibility criteria prescribed by the rules. They contended that every public appointment under Article 16 of the Constitution must be fair, non-arbitrary, and reasonable.
Mr. Banerjee, on behalf of the third respondent, appealed to the conscience of the Court, arguing that the respondent had effectively discharged his duties and performed his functions as Chairperson over the last 42 months, and less than 6 months remained for him to demit office.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that appointing someone without meeting the requisite experience would be a fraud on the public. It also noted that making appointments in departure from statutory requirements or public advertisement process amounts to a fraud that unravels everything.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were accepted, and the appointment of the third respondent as Chairperson was quashed. The third respondent was directed to step down from the office forthwith, but with a week's time to enable him to complete his pending assignments without taking any policy decision or decision involving finances.
A fresh process was initiated for appointing a new Chairperson expeditiously. No future benefits were to be given to the third respondent on the basis of the service rendered as Chairperson beyond seven days from the date.

</FUNCT>

<FACTS>
The case involves the appeal of an accused person against their conviction for certain offences. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence, including a trolley bag allegedly found in the possession of the accused in Nasik. However, the defence raised several infirmities in the prosecution story, including the lack of description of articles or the place where they were allegedly kept. The defence also pointed out that none of the items were linked to the accused.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defence argued that:
* The theory that the accused retained the ID card of the deceased for over 2 months was unnatural, given their alleged attempt to get rid of the trolley bag in Nasik.
* PW-5, who acted as a Panch witness, was unreliable due to his previous experience as a Panch witness and acquaintance with PW-38.
* The prosecution had not answered the infirmities pointed out by the defence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* There were gaping holes in the prosecution story.
* The circumstances adduced did not lead to the sole hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.
* The chain of circumstances was not complete and left reasonable grounds for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The test of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (Supra) was not satisfied, and sustaining a conviction based on this sketchy and disjointed evidence would be disregarding the warning of Judge Barron Alderson in Reg vs. Hodge [1838] 2 Lew 227.
* It would be extremely unsafe to sustain a conviction against the appellant as the prosecution had not established its case beyond reasonable doubt.
* The accused was acquitted with regard to the offences for which they were charged, and they shall be set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute regarding the ownership of land, specifically whether it was Shamlat deh (community land) or not. The petitioner got possession of the land based on a lease from the Panchayat concerned.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that they had self-cultivating possession of the land for 12 years preceding the commencement of the 1961 Act, which entitled them to claim benefits under the Act. They also claimed that their lease agreement with the Panchayat was in the nature of allotment and not a simple lease.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the expression "banjar qadim" in the jamabandi for the year 1950-51 holds significance. It explained that if land has remained uncultivated for four successive crops, it is classified as Banjar Jadid or new fallow. If it continues to be uncultivated and the same entries are maintained for the next four harvests, such land comes under the category of banjar qadim or old fallow.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the petitioner's claim for cultivation over the land could not be presumed for a period of 12 years immediately preceding the commencement of the 1961 Act. The court also observed that the petitioner, who got possession of the subject land based on a lease, cannot be heard to contend that they cease to be a lessee. The court further noted that while considering the question of benefit flowing from the amendment to Section 2 (g) of the Act by inserting (ii-a) to it, the land in question should have been Shamlat deh and the person claiming the benefit must establish that it was allotted to them on permanent basis or transferred by way of sale or in any other manner.
The court also cited its earlier decision in Dalip Ram's case (supra), where it had held that 'lease' and 'allotment' are different, and a person who got possession of subject land by way of lease cannot be heard to challenge the title or ownership of the Panchayat concerned from whom it got the land on lease. 
The Special Leave Petition was dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the sale of a property. The original plaintiff (appellant) had entered into an agreement to purchase the property from the defendants. The trial court granted specific performance of the contract, directing the appellant to pay the balance consideration of Rs. 13,50,000/- to the defendants upon receipt of which they would execute the Sale Deed in favour of the appellant. However, the High Court set aside this decree and the appellant appealed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the trial court's decision was correct and that the High Court had erred in setting it aside. The appellant also submitted that the defendants' contention that they were not getting along well with their family members and needed the property for shelter was not a valid ground to refuse specific performance of the contract.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the trial court had framed an issue regarding the readiness and willingness of the appellant to perform his part of the contract, which the trial court had answered in the affirmative. The High Court did not disturb this finding. Additionally, there was no evidence on record that the suit property was the only shelter available to the defendants.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court. It modified the original decree of the trial court, directing the appellant to pay an amount of Rs. 20,00,000/- to the defendants upon receipt of which they would execute the Sale Deed in favour of the appellant.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and its WTE project, which was established to dispose of waste generated in the city. The MCD applied for adoption of tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) granted approval to the tariff with certain conditions, but this decision was overturned by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). The MCD appealed to the Supreme Court, which allowed the appeals and quashed the APTEL's order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the MCD include:

* The WTE project was established on a Design, Build, Finance, and Operate basis, with the ownership remaining with the MCD after 25 years.
* The DERC had granted approval to the tariff with certain conditions, including compliance with Rule 15 of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.
* The APTEL's decision was based on a hyper-technical ground, disregarding the larger public interest served by the WTE project.

The arguments presented by the APTEL are not explicitly stated in the provided text.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The APTEL failed to consider all aspects of the matter, including the mandate of Rule 15 and the financial evaluation report.
* The WTE project was established for the larger public interest, providing for disposal of waste generated in the city.
* The APTEL's decision was based on a flawed understanding of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals and quashed the APTEL's order. The judgment states:

"The appeals are allowed; the Impugned common final judgment and order of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity at New Delhi dated 31st August 2023 passed in DFR No. 245 of 2023 and DFR No. 247 of 2023 is quashed and set aside; the orders of the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission dated 6th March 2023 in Petition No. 65 of 2022 and 7th March 2023 in Petition No. 72 of 2022 are affirmed."
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an arbitral award dated 03.06.2005, which was challenged by the Division Bench of the High Court on grounds of "opposed to the public policy of India", "patent illegality" and "shocking the conscience of the court". The Arbitral Tribunal had interpreted Clause 51 in a reasonable manner based on the evidence on record.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner (appellant) argued that the impugned order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court was unsustainable, as it exceeded the limited jurisdiction under Section 37 of the 1996 Act. The respondent (respondent in appeal) relied on various judgments to support their contention that frequent interference with arbitral awards would defeat the very purpose of the 1996 Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the jurisdiction conferred on courts under Section 34 of the 1996 Act is fairly narrow, and when it comes to scope of an appeal under Section 37 of the 1996 Act, the jurisdiction of the appellate court in examining an order passed under Section 34 is all the more circumscribed. The court also noted that arbitral awards which contain reasons, especially when they interpret contractual terms, ought not to be interfered with lightly.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the impugned order cannot be sustained and set it aside, restoring the arbitral award dated 03.06.2005. The court further stated that a great deal of restraint is required to be shown while examining the validity of an arbitral award when such an award has been upheld, wholly or substantially, under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a decree holder who failed to deposit the balance sale consideration within the stipulated time period. The High Court intervened, and the executing court's order was set aside.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are based on the following points:
*   The decree holder deposited the balance sale consideration way back in 2019 but failed to seek permission to do so within a reasonable period of time. 
*   The appellate court had not stipulated any particular time period for depositing the balance sale consideration, and hence it was expected of the decree holder to deposit the same within a reasonable period.
*   A delay of 2 years in filing the execution petition and 4 years in depositing the balance sale consideration is considered excessive by the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
*   The procedure for payment of balance amount of consideration can be filed in the Court of the first instance as well as in the appellate court, and it should be moulded to subserve substantial justice.
*   Technicalities would not stand in the way to subserve substantive justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The High Court had quashed the complaint case filed by the appellant against Respondent No.1 under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The appellant, M/s. M.K. Industries Ltd., had filed a complaint case in the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khurja, Bulandshahar, alleging that Respondent No.1 had committed an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the High Court's decision to quash the complaint case was incorrect and based on a perfunctory and erroneous reasoning. The appellant submitted that Sh. Neeraj Kumar, who had been authorized by the sole proprietor of the appellant-firm, M/s. M.K. Industries Ltd., possessed personal knowledge of the facts of the matter at hand and was well-equipped to initiate criminal proceedings against Respondent No.1.
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court's decision to quash the complaint case was unwarranted and based on an incorrect factual basis. The Court noted that it had repeatedly cautioned that the inherent powers under Section 482 of the CrPC should be exercised sparingly and with great caution, and not used to interfere with the jurisdiction of the lower courts or to scuttle a fair investigation or prosecution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court's decision to quash the complaint case was based on an absence of careful consideration. The Court noted that the documents filed by the appellant, including the authorization letter and affidavit, clearly indicated that Sh. Neeraj Kumar had been authorized to act on behalf of the appellant-firm and possessed personal knowledge of the facts of the matter.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and quashed the final judgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. The Court directed that the Complaint No. 701 of 2021 be restored to the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khurja, Bulandshahar, for hearing and decision on its own merits.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the Insurance Company (Respondent No. 2) against the order of the High Court of Delhi, which enhanced the rate of interest awarded to the appellant from the date of filing of the claim petition till actual realisation.
The accident occurred on November 25, 2008, and the claim petition was filed in 2009.
The Insurance Company had initially paid an amount of Rs. 6,75,000/-, leaving a balance of Rs. 3,25,000/-
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text.
However, it can be inferred that the Insurance Company argued against the enhancement of interest rate and the quantum of compensation awarded to the appellant.
The respondent also argued for a proportionate reduction in liability as the driver-cum-owner had paid an amount of Rs. 3,25,000/- towards the claim.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the High Court's order enhancing the rate of interest was correct and maintained it at 9% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till actual realisation.
The Court also noted that the Insurance Company shall be entitled to adjust the amount already paid, if any.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order dated 7th November 2017 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in MAC. APP. 1107/2011.
The Court directed the Insurance Company (Respondent No. 2) to disburse the compensation awarded to the appellant as above, adjusting any amount already paid.
The inter-se liability of the driver-cum-owner and the insurance company was left to be decided in accordance with law.
The Court also directed that an amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- should be disbursed to the father of the appellant as her guardian, which shall be invested in one or more Fixed Deposits Receipts to attract the maximum rate of interest.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the investigation of subject FIRs and further proceedings in pursuance thereof. The first respondent was employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar, and an investigation was conducted by the CBI against him.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The first respondent argued that since he was employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar, an investigation was not permissible unless there was a specific consent of State of Bihar under Section 6 of the DSPE Act. However, this argument was rejected by the Court, which held that if the offence is committed in Delhi, merely because the investigation incidentally transcends to the Territory of State of Bihar, it cannot be held that the investigation against an officer employed in the territory of Bihar cannot be permitted unless there was specific consent under Section 6 of the DSPE Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the respondent-State having granted general consent in terms of Section 6 of the DSPE Act vide notification dated 19.02.1996, it was not open to the State to argue to the contrary.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals and set aside the impugned common order dated 13.04.2023 passed by the High Court in WP No.26990 of 2021, and 5441 of 2022. Resultantly, CC Nos.13 of 2022 and 15 of 2022 arising respectively from the FIR Nos.10A/2017 and RC22(A)/2017, CBI, HYD, were restored into the files of Court of Special Jude for CBI Cases, Kurnool, where it was pending at the time of passing of the impugned order.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves Mahadeo, who was dismissed from his job by the Corporation. He filed a claim for 100% back wages and terminal benefits. The court initially awarded him 100% back wages but later modified it to 75% of the back wages.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court considered various principles of law, including:
- The principle that an employee who is willing to perform work but is not accepted by the employer should be restored with all benefits.
- The onus of proof shifting from the employee to the employer if the employer asserts that the employee was gainfully employed between the dates of termination and proposed reinstatement.
The court also considered the interest of justice in awarding lumpsum compensation instead of reinstatement with back wages in exceptional cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The Corporation's actions led to Mahadeo being deprived of his work, making him entitled to restoration of all benefits.
- The employer cannot escape the burden of bearing back wages if their action is held to be illegal and bad in law.
- The exact quantum of wages earned by Mahadeo was not available, but it was clear that the Corporation's actions led to his dismissal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ordered that:
- Mahadeo is entitled to 75% of the back wages from the date of his termination till the date of his superannuation.
- He is also entitled to full terminal benefits, along with interest @ 6% per annum, had he never been dismissed from service.
- The amounts due to Mahadeo shall be released in his favour by the Corporation within three months from the date of its communication; in default, the said amount shall carry further interest @ 2% from such default till full payment.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The complainant filed a complaint, which was initially believed to be a non-cognizable offense. However, an FIR was lodged 58 days later under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including Section 509, which is a cognizable offense.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that there were discrepancies and variations in the complaints and proceedings, suggesting a deliberate attempt to reclassify the nature of the proceedings from non-cognizable to cognizable or transform a civil dispute into a criminal matter. They also alleged that the complainant initiated the criminal proceedings with mala fide intentions, specifically to wreak vengeance, cause harm, or coerce a settlement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that allowing the criminal proceedings against the appellants would amount to an abuse of legal process and result in a travesty of justice. The court also noted that the presence of the second accused was questionable based on the contents of the complaints.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's order dated 31.07.2019, was set aside, and the chargesheet and entire proceedings against the appellants were quashed. The appeals were allowed, but it was clarified that the findings/observations made in the judgment would have no bearing on the pending reference between the parties before the Labour Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the establishment of a Task Force to investigate and address issues related to mental health, particularly among children. The court notes that there is a growing concern about the increasing number of children suffering from mental health issues in India.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated. However, based on the context, it appears that the court is considering the need for a Task Force to address the issue of mental health among children.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that there is a growing concern about the increasing number of children suffering from mental health issues in India and notes that this problem requires urgent attention. The court also recognizes the importance of providing support and resources to children who are struggling with mental health issues.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the establishment of a Task Force to investigate and address issues related to mental health among children.

</JUDGMENT>

Additionally, the court orders:

* The Union of India to deposit an amount of Rupees Twenty Lacs (Rs 20,00,000/-) with the Registry within two weeks as an outlay for the initial operations of the Task Force
* The Ministry of Education to provide logistical support to facilitate the functioning of the Task Force
* The Task Force to present an interim report within four months and a final report within eight months from the date of the order
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The election in question took place in 2021. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate directed a recount, but the High Court set this aside due to the impugned judgment. The appellant alleges a disparity in the count of votes informed to them and that finally disclosed in the official form, amounting to 19 votes.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given case. However, it can be inferred that the appellant sought a recount based on the alleged disparity in vote counts and the missing Presiding Officer's records.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Each vote has its own value, irrespective of its effect in the final outcome of the election. The sanctity of each vote must be protected. There were deliberate attempts to benefit the ultimate victor, including the use of police force and missing documents.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the High Court passed in Writ-C No.35734 of 2022 is set aside, and the order dated 31st October 2022 passed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in Election Petition No.02010/2021 is restored. The appeal is allowed. The Registry is directed to communicate a copy of this judgment to the Registrar General, High Court of Judicature at Allahabad.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The deceased, a young woman of 25 years, died in an unfortunate incident. 
An Accidental Death Report was lodged on the day of the incident by the deceased's brother.
A criminal case (Sessions Case No. 75 of 2015) was filed against the appellants for allegedly instigating or abetting the deceased to commit suicide.
The FIR was lodged five days after the incident, alleging that the appellants' words at a mahalakshmi temple had put the deceased in a state of depression and led her to take her own life.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution failed to prima facie establish that the appellants had any intention to instigate or aid or abet the deceased to commit suicide.
A gap of over a month between the alleged instigation and the commission of suicide was sufficient time for the deceased to think over and reflect on the matter, dissolving the nexus or proximate link between the two acts.
The prosecution failed to provide sufficient material to show that the appellants had intended by their words to push the deceased into such a position that she was left with no other option but to commit suicide.
Allowing the appeal would prevent an abuse of process of law, as continuation of criminal proceedings against the appellants would be unjustified in the absence of sufficient evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's reasoning for refusing to discharge the appellants was considered perfunctory by the court.
The prosecution failed to establish a clear nexus between the act of instigation and the commission of suicide due to the significant time gap between the two events.
The Accidental Death Report did not mention any involvement of the appellants in the suicidal death of the deceased, highlighting a discrepancy with the FIR lodged later.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal, quashing and setting aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court.
The court discharged the appellants from Sessions Case No. 75 of 2015, canceling their bail bonds if any existed.
The court disposed of pending application(s), if any, on December 20, 2024.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a marriage that has broken down, and the wife is seeking a decree of divorce. The couple has been separated for an extended period, and there are two children involved.
The wife has spent significant time during the pendency of the litigation without the emotional or financial support of the husband.
The husband's income must have increased substantially over the years, considering the duration of their separation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties in this case are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the judgment, it can be inferred that the wife's primary argument is for a decree of divorce and permanent alimony due to the husband's failure to provide emotional or financial support during their separation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court in this case include:
- The duration of the marriage and the earning capacities of the parties are crucial factors to consider while awarding maintenance or alimony.
- Granting a lump sum as permanent alimony ensures finality and reduces the scope for future litigation between the parties.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court has directed the husband to pay a sum of Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) to the wife as permanent alimony and an additional Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) to their daughter for her education and future expenses.
The payments shall be made within four months from the date of this judgment.
The decree of divorce is upheld, and the maintenance amount above granted is directed to be paid by the respondent to the appellant and their daughter within the specified time.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of a Kerala government notification, which exempted properties up to 25 cents in extent from payment of fees for change of land use category. The respondent sought to benefit from this exemption despite having total property extent exceeding 25 cents. The appellant-State issued a clarification on July 23, 2021, stating that the exempted benefit cannot be allowed if the total extent exceeds 25 cents.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant-State argued that the notification's intention was to grant an exemption for properties up to 25 cents in extent. They pointed out that the subsequent clarification issued on July 23, 2021, reiterated this position and specified that if the total extent exceeds 25 cents, the exempted benefit cannot be allowed.

The State also relied on Rule 12 Clause 9 of the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Rules, 2008, which clearly states that no fee is to be remitted when the extent is up to 25 cents, but a 10% fee is payable for land above 25 cents up to 1 Acre or less.

The State further argued that the learned Single Judge as also the Division Bench fell in error in holding that land up to 25 cents is exempted from payment of fees in all cases.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that no fault can be found with the action of the appellant-State. The subsequent clarification dated July 23, 2021, reiterated this position and specified the conditions for exemption.

The Court also noted that if the total extent exceeds 25 cents, the exempted benefit cannot be allowed, as clarified by the State in the notification and the subsequent clarification.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately held that the appeals were allowed. The judgment of the learned Single Judge as confirmed by the Division Bench was overruled on this count as not having laid down the correct interpretation of the law.

The respondent must pay a conversion fee as calculable on the total extent of land in their ownership. Pending application(s) if any shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The complainant and the appellant had a long-term consensual relationship that lasted for about nine years. During this period, the appellant provided financial support to the complainant. However, after discontinuing the financial support, the complainant made an allegation against the appellant of making a false promise of marriage and attempting to cheat her.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellant had committed rape under Section 376 IPC by making a false promise of marriage and continuing the physical relationship. The complainant alleged that the appellant's discontinuation of financial support was the triggering point for her to make the allegation against him.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there is a worrying trend in consensual relationships being criminalized after turning sour. It also noted that every case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances, as human relationships are dynamic and unpredictable. The court further observed that allowing the criminal proceeding to continue when no criminal liability can be attached would amount to an abuse of the process of the court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and order dated 12.02.2018 passed by the Bombay High Court in Criminal Writ Petition (CRWP) No. 5190 of 2017. As a result, the FIR being CR No. 302 of 2017 dated 15.08.2017 registered against the appellant with the Kharghar Police Station, Navi Mumbai under Sections 376, 420, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code was quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, a Christian by religion, claims to be still embracing Hinduism for the purpose of availing reservation in employment. The appellant has been baptized and regularly attends church, but makes dual claims regarding her religious identity.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellant's claim that she can continue to identify herself as a Hindu after baptism is untenable.
The conferment of Scheduled Caste communal status to the appellant would go against the very object of reservation and amount to fraud on the Constitution.
The purpose of conversion should be genuinely inspired by the principles, tenets, and spiritual thoughts of the religion, not for deriving benefits of reservation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
India is a secular country where every citizen has the right to practise and profess a religion of their choice as guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution.
The case highlights the issue of dual identities and ulterior motives behind conversions, which can defeat the social ethos of the policy of reservation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal stands dismissed. The conferment of Scheduled Caste communal status to the appellant is not permitted as it would go against the object of reservation and amount to fraud on the Constitution.
There is no order as to costs, and pending application(s), if any, shall stand closed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a trial where the accused were charged with abetment to commit suicide. The prosecution presented evidence, including a suicide note allegedly written by the deceased. The accused claimed that they had not committed any offense and were being falsely implicated.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the handwriting on the suicide note was confirmed by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to be of the deceased, thereby establishing the genuineness of the note. The prosecution further argued that the accused had accepted the report of the FSL and therefore had admitted the guilt.
However, the defense countered this argument by stating that the expert's evidence on handwriting is opinion-based and does not provide conclusive proof. They also claimed that there was no corroboration for the testimony of the handwriting expert, which made it unreliable.

Moreover, the defense argued that even if the suicide note were accepted as genuine, there was no direct evidence to show that the accused had incited or abetted the deceased to commit suicide.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The court observed that expert's evidence on handwriting is opinion-based and should be treated with caution. It also noted that in the absence of corroboration, such testimony may not be reliable.

Furthermore, the court found that there was no direct evidence linking the accused to the alleged offense of abetment to commit suicide. The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of the handwriting expert without examining them in court, which further weakened their case.
</ObservATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 17.12.2013 and of the trial court dated 12.05.2011.

The court held that even if the suicide note were accepted as genuine, there was no act of incitement on the part of the appellants proximate to the date on which the deceased committed suicide. It further found that no offense of abetment to commit suicide was made out against the appellants.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant was convicted under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder. The court found that the appellant actively participated in an attack on a victim, which resulted in the victim's death.
The conviction was upheld by both the Trial Court and the High Court, with the latter confirming the sentence of life imprisonment.
The court also noted that the offence occurred in a context of political rivalry, exacerbating its gravity.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued for a reduction in sentence due to old age and medical condition. However, the court held that these factors alone could not absolve or mitigate responsibility for the crime.
The defence also relied on parity with other similar cases, but the court found no compelling justification to interfere with the sentence imposed by the lower Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that a murder committed with the intent to target vital organs, particularly in a group setting, reflects a level of intent and cruelty that demands an appropriate punitive response.
The offence's gravity was exacerbated by its occurrence in a context of political rivalry, which contributes to social unrest and weakens public confidence in the rule of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the conviction under Section 302 IPC and the sentence of life imprisonment. The minimum sentence for murder is indeed life imprisonment, and therefore, grounds like leniency or old age could not be considered.
The appeal for reduction of the sentence was dismissed, and the conviction and sentence were upheld.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves contempt of court charges against the appellants for violating an order to not alienate a subject matter property. The order was passed in 2007 and reiterated in August 2007, with the Court extending its duration over time. Despite express orders from the Court, the appellants continued to alienate the property.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court held that the actions of the appellants constituted contempt of court, which is a special jurisdiction exercised sparingly and with caution to maintain the dignity and majesty of law. The Court noted that the purpose of contempt jurisdiction is to uphold the administration of justice and protect public confidence in the judicial institutions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observation from the case is that the appellants' actions were a clear violation of the Court's order, and the exercise of contempt jurisdiction was justified. The High Court also noted that no steps were taken by the appellants to discharge the order despite being within their rights to do so.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court confirmed the judgment of the High Court, upholding the punishment for contempt of court. However, the Court modified the order to delete the three months' confinement in civil prison and enhanced the compensation payable by the appellants from Rs. 10 lakhs to Rs. 13 lakhs, along with simple interest at 6% from the date of the judgment of the lower Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around a public servant who was accused of accepting a bribe. The prosecution presented evidence, including the recovery of the bribe amount from the respondent. However, the High Court acquitted the respondent, citing that the amount was trivial and did not warrant drawing a presumption of corruption.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The prosecution argued that the receipt of payment or an agreement to receive gratification by a public servant constitutes a clear case of nexus or corroboration, and thus, a presumption can be drawn under Section 20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The prosecution also contended that the first two limbs of sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 13 make it clear that adequacy of consideration is irrelevant to draw the presumption.
The respondent's explanation for accepting the bribe was deemed insufficient by the court, as there was no concrete material to support his claims. The High Court's judgment was criticized for being perverse and liable to be interfered with.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The case highlights the importance of considering all evidence and circumstances before making a decision. The court noted that the value of gratification should be considered in proportion to the act to be done or not done, favor or disfavour sought, so as to be trivial to convince the Court, not to draw any presumption of corrupt practice.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the criminal appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by the High Court. The court restored the judgment and order passed by the trial Court, directing the necessary steps to secure the respondent and commit him in prison to undergo the remaining period of sentence and to recover the fine imposed on him.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal filed by the appellants, challenging the summoning order passed by the Trial Court. The appellants were initially summoned as accused under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). However, their application for discharge was rejected by the Trial Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they had already been discharged in the same proceeding prior to the commencement of the trial. They contended that a right of hearing would accrue only to a person who is already discharged in the very same proceeding prior to the commencement of the trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that Section 319 does not contemplate that a summoned person must be given an opportunity of being heard before being added as an accused to face the trial. However, after the rejection of an application under Section 319, a right enures in favour of the proposed accused.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the High Court's revisional order directing the Trial Court to consider the application afresh was deemed to have been passed on the original date (19.07.2010). The summoning order passed by the Trial Court on 21.02.2024 was an extension of the revisional order, and it replaced and substituted the earlier order rejecting the second Section 319 application.
The Court also observed that if a High Court passes an order in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction which is prejudicial to the benefit already enured in favour of the proposed accused, then the High Court is obligated under law to provide an opportunity of hearing to the proposed accused. This is also mandated by sub-section (2) of Section 401 of the CrPC.
The appeal was dismissed, and the Trial Court was directed to take necessary steps in furtherance of the summoning order dated 21.02.2024 to ensure that the appellants are produced before the court to face the trial.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
Mathew was carrying on a business of procurement and supply of railway tickets without the authorisation of the railways.
Ramesh, an authorised agent of the railways, was also involved in the procurement and supply of railway tickets.
A first information report (FIR) was filed against Mathew and Ramesh under Section 143 of the Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that Mathew's actions were a clear violation of Section 143 of the Act, which deals with unauthorised persons carrying on the business of procurement and supply of railway tickets.
Mathew's counsel argued that he was not an authorised agent, but there was no clear evidence to prove his guilt.
Ramesh's counsel argued that even if Ramesh had breached any terms or conditions of the contract, it would be a civil matter and not a criminal one.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that Section 143 of the Act only deals with unauthorised persons carrying on the business of procurement and supply of railway tickets.
The court noted that Mathew was prima facie guilty under Section 143(1)(a) of the Act.
The court also observed that Ramesh, being an authorised agent, could not be proceeded against under Section 143 of the Act for alleged breach of any terms or conditions of the contract.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the lead appeal and restored the criminal proceedings against Mathew.
The connected appeals were also allowed, but the criminal proceedings against Ramesh were quashed.
The court ordered that the proceedings against Mathew should be taken to their logical conclusion in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a conviction under Section 302 of the IPC for murder. The prosecution's case is based on the testimony of two eye-witnesses, PW1 and PW4. The incident occurred in 1992, and the accused was firing towards fleeing people in a commercial locality. One of the shots injured a person, while the second shot resulted in the death of a 10-year-old boy.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the accused had fired freely towards the fleeing complainant party and that the first shot had injured one person, while the second shot had resulted in the death of the 10-year-old son of the complainant. The prosecution contended that the facts and circumstances of the case established that the accused had intended to commit murder.
The defense argued that the accused had no intention to cause death and that the firing was a rash and negligent action. The defense contended that the act committed by the accused was not murder under Section 302 read with Section 301 of the IPC but was an offence under Section 304A of the IPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the doctrine of transfer of malice, as contemplated under Section 301, is applicable to the facts of the case. The court noted that even if it is held for the sake of argument that the accused had no intention to cause death, the doctrine of transfer of malice would still apply.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court modified the impugned judgment and order of the High Court to convict the appellant under Section 304 Part-I of the IPC instead of Section 302. The sentence was reduced to the period already undergone, taking into account the year of the incident (1992) and the age of the accused as on date (74 years).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction and sentence of an appellant in a murder case. The appellant was convicted based on an extra-judicial confession made before certain witnesses, who claimed that the appellant was in a confused state when making the confession.
The testimony of the prosecution witnesses suffers from serious lack of credibility and also hits by contradictions which strike at the very root of the prosecution case.
No corroborating circumstances have been brought on record by the prosecution.
A strong suspicion exists against the appellant, but suspicion cannot take the place of hard evidence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution relies heavily on the extra-judicial confession made by the appellant before certain witnesses. However, this confession lacks credibility due to the witnesses' testimony that the appellant was in a confused state when making the confession.
The testimonies of PW-3 and PW-6 suffer from material omission, as their statements made under Section 161 Cr.P.C. are at variance with their evidence in court regarding the confession made by the accused before PW-3.
The prosecution fails to provide any corroborating circumstances to support the conviction based on the extra-judicial confession.
The strong suspicion against the appellant is not sufficient to convict him without hard evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The extra-judicial confession lacks credibility due to the witnesses' testimony that the appellant was in a confused state when making the confession.
The testimonies of PW-3 and PW-6 suffer from material omission, which strikes at the very root of the prosecution case.
No corroborating circumstances have been brought on record by the prosecution to support the conviction based on the extra-judicial confession.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the criminal appeal and sets aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant. The court holds that it would be wholly unsafe to sustain the conviction of the appellant based on weak circumstantial evidence which lacks credibility. The court further states that suspicion, howsoever strong, cannot take the place of hard evidence.
The court orders the release of the appellant from custody forthwith if not required in any other case.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the prosecution of an accused for committing a forcible and violent sexual assault on a child victim, followed by strangulation and killing. The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to prove the guilt of the accused.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that they had established the guilt of the accused through an unbroken chain of incriminating circumstances. They relied on the five golden principles (Panchsheel) laid down by the Supreme Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, which are: 
1. The circumstances should form a circle and not remain isolated. 
2. The circumstances should be conclusive and not dubious. 
3. Each fact should be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
4. No fact is to be relied upon alone but all the facts should be considered together. 
5. It must be concluded that there is no other plausible explanation for the occurrence of the circumstances except the guilt of the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judges observed that while they concurred with the ultimate conclusions reached by the learned trial Court and the High Court, they had concerns about the adequacy of the evaluative process undertaken to arrive at those decisions. They noted that the Courts had failed to delineate the inferences derivable from the testimonies of the witnesses and had not explicitly articulated how each piece of evidence contributed to the overall narrative of guilt.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the prosecution had succeeded in constructing an unbroken chain of circumstances that irrefutably established the culpability of the accused. The judges emphasized the importance of meticulously examining each link of incriminating circumstantial evidence to determine whether it was proved individually and collectively formed a consistent hypothesis of guilt. They also underscored the need for the judgment to comprehensively elucidate the rationale for accepting or rejecting specific pieces of evidence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the conviction of two individuals, A-1 and A-2, under various sections of the POCSO Act and the IPC. The prosecution alleged that A-1 committed an act of sexual harassment against a minor girl student, while A-2 was accused of criminal intimidation. However, the defense argued that the evidence presented by the prosecution was flawed and marred by contradictions.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The prosecution's main argument was that the victim's testimony alone is sufficient to convict A-1 under section 11 read with section 12 of the POCSO Act. The defense, on the other hand, argued that a strict scrutiny of the evidence is necessary, and the prosecution failed to establish the accused's involvement in any criminal act.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observed that the evidence presented by the prosecution was inadequate, with material contradictions and discrepancies. The victim's testimony appeared muddled and prevaricated, which raised doubts about her credibility. The court also noted that an accusation of sexual harassment against a teacher would have severe consequences for their reputation and future life.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately held that the circumstances on which the conclusion of guilt was to be drawn were not fully established. As such, the conviction of A-1 and A-2 was set aside, and they were acquitted. The court also noted that the prosecution failed to prove the accused's involvement in any criminal act, and therefore, their rights to live a life of dignity and personal liberty should not be put at jeopardy on the basis of half-baked evidence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Election Petition No. 1 of 2021 was filed by the Respondent No. 1 (Election Petitioner) before the High Court against the Appellant. The petition alleged that the Appellant's nomination form was improperly accepted and that there were corrupt practices committed during the election.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Election Petitioner argued that the Appellant's nomination form was improperly accepted by the Returning Officer due to an oral objection raised by the Respondent No. 1 regarding the education qualification stated in the affidavit in Form-26. The petitioner also alleged that there were corrupt practices committed during the election, including "undue influence" under Section 123(2) of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the Election Petitioner had failed to make averments in the petition as to how the Appellant's nomination was liable to be rejected by the Returning Officer on the grounds mentioned in Section 36(2) of the Act. The Court also noted that there was no mention of the particulars as to how such improper acceptance of nomination had materially affected the result of the election.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court dismissed the Election Petition No. 1 of 2021 filed by the Respondent No. 1 (Election Petitioner) on grounds that the petition did not set out grounds as contemplated in Section 100 and did not conform to the requirement of Sections 81 and 83 of the Act. The Court held that an omission of a single material fact leading to an incomplete cause of action or omission to contain a concise statement of material facts on which the Election petitioner relies for establishing a cause of action, would entail rejection of Election Petition under Order VII Rule 11 read with Section 83 and 87 of the RP Act. The Appeal stands allowed accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the agricultural Watan lands in Pimpari Chinchwad, which were originally owned by Balaji Chimnaji More. After his death in February/March 1958, the legal heirs of the original Watandar attempted to take possession of the lands from the tenants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants (legal heirs) argued that they had the right to terminate the tenancy and take possession of the lands under Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act. They claimed that the provisions of the Tenancy Act were not applicable to these lands.
On the other hand, the tenants argued that they had a valid tenancy agreement and were entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase of the lands under Section 32 of the Tenancy Act in terms of Section 8 of the Abolition Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the provisions of the Tenancy Act were applicable to the subject lands from 1957 onwards. The legal heirs' attempt to terminate the tenancy and take possession under the 1874 Act was invalid, as the Tenancy Act took precedence.
The tenants were entitled to exercise their right of statutory purchase after the exemption afforded by Section 88CA ceased to exist. This right became operational on November 27, 1964, when the Watan lands were regranted to the heirs of the original Watandar.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that it was not open to the appellants to proceed against the tenants under the provisions of Sections 5, 11, and 11A of the 1874 Act after Balaji Chimnaji More's death in February/March 1958. This is because the provisions of the Tenancy Act were very much applicable to the subject lands by then and more so, Sections 29 and 31 thereof.
The court dismissed the appeal as it was devoid of merit and upheld the impugned judgment dated 01.02.2005 passed by the Bombay High Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants failed to comply with the orders of the trial Court, including not appearing before the Trial Court after receiving summons and issuing bailable warrants. They also withdrew a bail-cum-surrender application on the fear of being arrested.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The power to grant anticipatory bail is an extraordinary power, and the court must be cautious in exercising it. The appellants' consistent disobedience of the trial Court's orders and their failure to challenge the proclamation under Section 82 Cr.PC or enter appearance before the Trial Court to avert consequences justify rejecting their application for anticipatory bail.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the power to grant anticipatory bail is an extraordinary power, and its grant should be left to the cautious and judicious discretion of the court depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. The appellants' consistent disobedience of the trial Court's orders and their failure to challenge the proclamation under Section 82 Cr.PC or enter appearance before the Trial Court to avert consequences leave no hesitation in holding that they are not entitled to seek the benefit of pre-arrest bail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's order rejecting the application for anticipatory bail is upheld, and the appeal is dismissed. The appellants' conduct in defying lawful orders of the court and attempting to delay proceedings warrants this decision.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The 1994 notification made 'ghee' a product that could be regulated under provisions of the Act, Market Committees were empowered to levy fee on the sale and purchase of 'ghee'. The appellants were not required to pay market fee as they were granted interim protection by the High Court. After the majority decision of the High Court in Kommissetty Nammalwar (Supra), market committees started issuing demand notices to the producers of ‘Ghee’ asking them to pay fees from the date of the notification in the year 1994 to the date of the High Court judgment i.e. 01.05.2009.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the process under Section 3, has not been followed for working the scheme under Section 4 of the Act. They also prayed that they should be exempted from paying the fee to the market committees prior to the High Court judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Market Committee has the duty to enforce the provisions of the Act within a notified area and provide facilities in the markets for the purchase and sale of notified products. The appellants have availed the facility given by the Market Committee and hence they are liable to pay the fee.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that there was nothing wrong in the 1994 notification and the challenge to the notification has rightly been turned down by the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The appellants' prayer that Respondent Market Committees should be restrained from collecting market fees prior to the date of the High Court Judgment cannot be accepted. However, since this fee which has now accumulated for more than 14 years between 05.07.1994 to 01.05.2009 may entail some hardship on the appellants, they shall be permitted to deposit this fee with the Committee within two years from today, in four equal instalments.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves charges under Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act against the appellants. The prosecution's case is based entirely on a suicide note left behind by the deceased before committing suicide. The deceased was frustrated due to work pressure, apprehensive of various random factors unconnected to his official duties, and felt pressured from working in two different districts.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they were not remotely connected with the offence under Section 306 IPC and therefore, the High Court should have quashed the proceedings against them. The prosecution's case is based on a suicide note, but the contents of the note do not indicate any act or omission on the part of the accused appellant which could make him responsible for abetment as defined under Section 107 IPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court was criticized for rejecting the petition filed by the appellants under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the charges under Section 306 IPC against them. The investigating agency had initially proposed a closure report in the matter after conducting thorough investigation, which indicates that there were no justifiable grounds to permit the prosecution of the appellant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and quashed all proceedings sought to be taken against the appellant in the criminal case pending for the offences punishable under Section 306 IPC and Section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act. The Court held that allowing the prosecution of the appellant would amount to gross abuse of process to law, as the necessary ingredients of the offence of abetment to commit suicide were not made out from the chargesheet.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a dispute between the appellant society and the respondents, who are employees of the school administered by the appellant society. The respondents claimed that their salaries and service conditions were unfairly altered by the appellant society after they took over the administration of the school.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that the doctrine of legitimate expectation applied to the facts of the case, citing past practice and statutory obligations as grounds for their claim. They contended that the appellant society had a duty to maintain the status quo regarding their salaries and service conditions.
The appellants countered by stating that the relationship between the administration of the school and its employees remained a contractual one, falling within the ambit of private law. They argued that there was no express or implied promise made by the appellant society to keep the respondents' salaries and service conditions intact, nor any statutory obligation to do so.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The court observed that legitimate expectation is a device created to maintain a check on arbitrariness in state action. However, it does not extend to contracts between private parties, where the doctrine of promissory estoppel holds the field.
The court noted that even if the function being performed by a private educational institution may be considered as a public function, the relationship between the administration and its employees remains contractual.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals, setting aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. The respondents were directed to continue serving on the terms and conditions stipulated by the appellant society. No costs were ordered against either party.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a criminal complaint filed against the present appellant. The High Court had passed an order in Criminal O.P. No.20716 of 2020 and Criminal M.P. No. 8763 of 2020, which is being challenged by the appellant through this appeal. The FIR in Crime No.21 of 2020 was also filed against the present appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the appellant is that the High Court had erred in not exercising its inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC to quash the FIR and the consequential charge-sheet, despite there being no prima facie case made out against the appellant. The appellant relied on the judgment of this Court in Joseph Saivaraj A v. State of Gujarat (2019) 11 SCC 706 : 2018 INSC 1060, which held that even if a charge-sheet has been filed, the High Court can still examine whether the offences alleged to have been committed by the accused were prima facie made out from the complainant's FIR, charge-sheet, documents, etc.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court are that it is settled principle of law that the High Court can exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC even when the discharge application is pending with the trial court. The power conferred on the Court is to prevent abuse of process of any court or miscarriage of justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the Court is that it allows the appeal and quashes the order of the High Court dated 15th July 2022 in Criminal O.P. No.20716 of 2020 and Criminal M.P. No. 8763 of 2020. The FIR in Crime No.21 of 2020 and the consequential charge-sheet filed against the present appellant stand quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958, and its application to articles of association. The respondent company increased its share capital, and the appellants (the government) claimed that a stamp duty was payable on the increased share capital. However, the respondent argued that a cap of ₹50 lakhs had been introduced in the amended act, which exempted them from paying additional stamp duty on the increased share capital.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the amendment did not have retrospective effect and therefore could not be applied to the case. They claimed that the respondent should pay the full amount of stamp duty on the increased share capital.

The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the amended act introduced a cap of ₹50 lakhs, which exempted them from paying additional stamp duty on the increased share capital. They also contended that since the instrument 'Articles of Association' remained the same and the increase was initiated after the cap was introduced, the duty already paid on the same very instrument should be considered.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the amendment to the Maharashtra Stamp Act introduced a cap of ₹50 lakhs, which exempted companies from paying additional stamp duty on increased share capital. The court also noted that the respondent had initiated the increase in share capital after the cap was introduced.

The court further observed that since the instrument 'Articles of Association' remained the same and the increase was initiated by the respondent after the cap was introduced, the duty already paid on the same very instrument should be considered.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed the civil appeal and upheld the order of the High Court of Bombay. The court directed the appellants to refund ₹25 lakhs paid by the respondent along with interest @ 6% per annum.

The interim orders were vacated, and pending application(s), if any, were disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the acquittal of an accused person charged with various crimes. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence, including a confession allegedly made by the accused. However, the defense argued that this confession was unreliable and that there were inconsistencies in the prosecution's case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the accused's confession, although extra-judicial, was sufficient to prove his guilt. They also relied on the testimony of witnesses who claimed to have seen the accused at the scene of the crime. The defense countered by pointing out inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, including contradictions regarding the arrest and the unnatural conduct of a key witness.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that minor inconsistencies can be construed as reasonable doubts for ordering acquittal. However, the prosecution failed to establish a coherent chain of circumstances, rendering their case suspect rather than conclusive. The court also noted that every case where an guilty person goes unpunished due to any lacuna on the part of the investigating agency, prosecution or otherwise, shakes the conscience of society at large and diminishes the value of the rule of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court was held to have erred in reversing the decision of acquittal. The evidence of the prosecution made out a case for suspicion rather than conviction. Therefore, the impugned order and judgment were set aside, and the original order of acquittal was restored. The accused was acquitted from all charges and directed to be released forthwith if lying in custody.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a terror funding and conspiracy charge against the appellant, who is accused of being part of a terrorist gang. The charges include involvement in multiple roles and exchange of large quantum of money through different channels.
The appellant has been in jail for five years, but this fact does not absolve him of his role in the crime. The trial is already underway, with 22 witnesses including protected witnesses having been examined.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's counsel argued that:
- The name of the appellant did not find place in the terror funding chart.
- The mere fact that the accused has not received any funds or nothing incriminating was recovered from his mobile phone does not absolve him of his role in the instant crime.
- The case of KA Najeeb (supra) should be relied upon, which stated that an accused who has been in jail for more than five years and is awaiting trial can be granted bail.
However, the court rejected these arguments, stating that:
- The mere delay in trial pertaining to grave offences cannot be used as a ground to grant bail.
- If the appellant is released on bail, there is every likelihood that he will influence key witnesses of the case, which might hamper the process of justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The material on record prima facie indicates the complicity of the accused as a part of the conspiracy since he was knowingly facilitating the commission of a preparatory act towards the commission of terrorist act under section 18 of the UAP Act.
- Any observation made in the judgment is only for the purpose of deciding the present bail application and should not be construed as an expression on the merits of the matter before the trial court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court rejected the appellant's bail application, stating that:
- The material on record prima facie indicates the complicity of the accused as a part of the conspiracy since he was knowingly facilitating the commission of a preparatory act towards the commission of terrorist act under section 18 of the UAP Act.
- Any observation made in the judgment is only for the purpose of deciding the present bail application and should not be construed as an expression on the merits of the matter before the trial court.
The appeal fails, and the bail application of the appellant is rejected.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a respondent who was dismissed from service after being suspended pending disciplinary proceedings. The High Court allowed the writ petition, quashing the order of dismissal and directing the respondent's reinstatement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the petitioner (respondent) include:
• The charge-sheet did not have the approval of the competent authority, rendering it invalid.
• The respondent was forced to face proceedings and answer a charge-sheet without proper approval.

The court disagreed with these arguments, stating that the proposal to initiate disciplinary proceedings, including the draft charge-sheet, had been approved by the Chief Minister.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court:
• The Single Judge's decision was considered a grave miscarriage of justice in interfering with the order of dismissal on an untenable ground.
• The Division Bench failed to right the wrong and contributed to the failure of justice.
• The respondent had been out of service for nearly 8 years, which could be considered sufficient punishment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court:
• The impugned order of the Division Bench and the judgment and order of the Single Judge were set aside.
• The writ petition on the file of the High Court was dismissed.

The case involves Mysore Sales and the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS)–1, Bengaluru. The issue revolves around the applicability of Section 206C of the Income Tax Act to Mysore Sales and the liquor vendors who bought vending rights from them on auction. The High Court had dismissed writ petitions challenging orders passed by the Deputy Commissioner under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* Whether Section 206C of the Income Tax Act is applicable to Mysore Sales and the liquor vendors who bought vending rights from them on auction.
* Whether the liquor vendors can be termed as "buyers" within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C of the Income Tax Act.
* The necessity for principles of natural justice to be followed before passing an order under Section 206C(6) of the Income Tax Act, which entails adverse civil consequences.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
* The court holds that the liquor vendors cannot be termed as "buyers" within the meaning of Explanation(a) to Section 206C of the Income Tax Act.
* The High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petitions and consequently, the writ appeal challenging the orders dated 17.01.2001.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed in the case is as follows:
* The Division Bench of the High Court's judgment dated 13.03.2006 and connected writ appeals are set aside.
* The learned Single Judge of the High Court's judgment dated 27.10.2003 in Writ Petition Nos. 6869-6874 of 2001 and other connected writ petitions is set aside.

The Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 governs the regulation of the chartered accountancy profession in India.
A chapter on "Misconduct" is included to maintain ethical standards and prevent actions that may compromise public interests.
A disciplinary mechanism ensures a fair and transparent process for investigating and adjudicating alleged cases of misconduct.
Rule 9(3) provides additional options to the Board of Discipline, allowing it to proceed with dealing with the complaint by itself or referring it to the Disciplinary Committee.
The impugned rule is related to furthering the purposes of the Act in ensuring that a genuine complaint of professional misconduct against the member is not wrongly thrown out at the very threshold.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments on behalf of the Respondent:
Accepting the contention of the Appellant will create an anomalous situation where the Director (Discipline) has greater powers than the Board itself.
The "prima facie" opinion of the Director will become nothing but a final opinion if the Board has no option except to direct the Director (Discipline) to further investigate the matter.
Arguments on behalf of the Appellant:
Rule 9(3) goes beyond what is provided for under Section 21A(4) in terms of the options available to the Board of Discipline.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The general delegation of power under Section 29A(1) authorizes the Central Government to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act.
The object of the CA Act vis-à-vis the chapter on Misconduct is to set ethical guidelines, prevent actions that may compromise public interests, ensure accountability among chartered accountants, and preserve the profession's reputation.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between Karan Singh (the first plaintiff) and the legal representative of the first defendant. The first plaintiff had entered into an agreement to sell a one-half undivided share in the suit property with the first defendant, but the sale deed was not executed due to the non-granting of permission by the State Government under clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B of the Zamindari Abolition Act. The second plaintiff, who was also a party to the agreement, did not wish to get the specific performance of the sale deed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellants' senior counsel included:
- The second plaintiff was not interested in getting the specific performance, and therefore, the decree should have been restricted to the undivided one-half share in the suit property in favour of only the first plaintiff.
- Since Murari Singh (the second plaintiff) did not institute the suit, the decree for specific performance for the whole land, which was undivided could not have been decreed by the trial court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- As per Section 45 of the Transfer of Property Act, if there are co-owners and no agreement is made regarding their shares, they will be deemed to have equal shares.
- The defendants shall join the first plaintiff in applying for the grant of permission under clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B of the Zamindari Abolition Act to sell the one half-undivided share in the suit land to the first plaintiff within two months from today.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court includes:
- The impugned decree is modified, and a sale deed shall be executed in favour of Karan Singh (the first plaintiff) only to the extent of one half undivided share in the suit property.
- The defendants shall join the first plaintiff in applying for permission under clause (h) of sub-section (2) of Section 154-B of the Zamindari Abolition Act to sell the one half-undivided share in the suit land within two months from today.
- If the application is rejected, there shall be a decree for refund of the sum of Rs. 7,000/- against the legal representative of the first defendant together with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the rate of compensation to be paid to landowners whose properties were acquired by the authorities under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The High Court had granted compensation at the rate of INR 449 per sq. yd., but this was reduced to INR 340 per sq. yd. in subsequent proceedings. The matter eventually reached the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The landowners argued that the rate of compensation should be higher, citing various precedents and legal provisions, including Section 28A of the 1894 Act, which aims to rectify disparities between landowners. They also relied on Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equal treatment under the law.
The authorities (NOIDA) argued that the rate of compensation was reasonable and that the landowners' appeals were misconceived.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court noted that the issue was complicated by the fact that there were different rates of compensation being paid to different groups of landowners. The court also observed that the authorities had failed to follow proper procedures under Section 28A of the 1894 Act, which could have led to a more equitable distribution of compensation.
The Supreme Court further noted that the rate of compensation granted by the High Court was excessive and that it needed to be reduced in order to bring it in line with other precedents and legal provisions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately allowed the landowners' appeals in part, enhancing the rate of compensation from INR 340 per sq. yd. to INR 403 per sq. yd. The court also reduced the rate of compensation granted by the High Court from INR 449 per sq. yd. to INR 403 per sq. yd.
The authorities (NOIDA) were directed to deposit the enhanced compensation amount with the Reference Court within a period of eight weeks, after which it would be disbursed to the claimants at the earliest.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the admission of an instrument in evidence under the Indian Stamp Act, 1857. The appellant had filed a suit and produced a document as an exhibit which was insufficiently stamped. The Trial Court admitted the document in evidence but later exercised its inherent power to set aside the order after realizing that it had not applied its judicial mind when admitting the document.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the case, but the reasoning of the Trial Court and the High Court suggests the following points:

* The Trial Court admitted the document without applying its judicial mind, which is a requirement under sections 33 and 34 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1857.
* The Trial Court later exercised its inherent power to set aside the order after realizing its mistake.
* The High Court's decision to allow the appeal was based on the fact that the Trial Court had not applied its judicial mind when admitting the document.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the courts in this case include:

* The importance of applying a judicial mind when dealing with instruments under the Indian Stamp Act, 1857.
* The need for courts to uphold the sanctity of the legal framework governing stamp duty and prevent circumvention of these legal obligations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The Trial Court's order dated 19th October, 2010 was set aside by the High Court on 26th September, 2011.
* However, this decision was later reversed by the Supreme Court, which allowed the appeal and restored the Trial Court's original order.
* The Supreme Court held that the Trial Court had exercised its inherent power to do justice as well as to prevent abuse of process of court, despite not having applied its judicial mind when admitting the document.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a group of appellants who were selected and appointed to various posts in the year 1998. However, their appointments were challenged by one Archana Mishra (R-4) before the Collector. The matter went up to the High Court, where the Division Bench of the High Court passed a judgment against the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are as follows:
* The appellants argued that their appointments were valid and should not be set aside.
* They contended that they have been functioning in office for over 25 years and one of them has even superannuated.
* The appellants argued that the Collector and Archana Mishra (R-4) had failed to follow proper procedure and gave them an opportunity to respond before passing any orders.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in this case are as follows:
* The Court noted that the Division Bench of the High Court had passed a judgment against the appellants, but it was not clear if the judgment was based on the evidence presented or if it was a result of the Collector's failure to follow proper procedure.
* The Court observed that Archana Mishra (R-4) should have impleaded the candidates who were selected and appointed, including the appellants, before the Collector.
* The Court also noted that the Collector ought to have given an opportunity to implead with a stern direction that failure to implead would result in dismissal.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the Supreme Court is as follows:
* The appeals were allowed and the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court was set aside.
* The result would be that the appeal filed by Archana Mishra (R-4) before the Collector would stand dismissed.
* The appellants would be entitled to continue in service, deeming their appointments as valid and would be entitled to all service benefits.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal against the decision of a High Court, which had reversed the order of acquittal passed by a Trial Court in a criminal case. The appellants were charged with various offenses and were acquitted by the Trial Court. However, the High Court set aside this order and convicted them.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:
- The High Court erred in reversing the decision of acquittal without arriving at any finding of illegality or perversity or error in the reasoning of the Trial Court.
- Even on a fresh appreciation of evidence, the findings of the High Court were found to be incorrect.
- The appellants were acquitted from all charges leveled against them due to lack of sufficient evidence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Some key observations made in the case are:
- A distinction was drawn between "may have" and "must have", highlighting that a conviction can only be sustained if the Court forms the view that the accused "must have" committed the offense, and not just "may have".
- The circumstances in this case were found to be far from conclusive, and a conclusion of guilt could not be drawn from them.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:
- The impugned order and judgment of the High Court are set aside.
- The original order of acquittal passed by the Trial Court is restored.
- The appellants are acquitted from all charges leveled against them.
- They are directed to be released forthwith if they were lying in custody.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the acquittal of accused appellants in a criminal case. The prosecution had recovered certain weapons from open spaces, which were relied upon as incriminating material by the High Court to reverse the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the prosecution include:
* The disclosure statements made by the accused resulted in the recovery of the weapons.
* The seizure memos and voluntary statements were not proved by the Investigating Officer (PW-27) in his evidence.
* The recoveries were otherwise meaningful and were relied upon as incriminating material by the High Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations made by the court include:
* The disclosure statements cannot be read in evidence without a description of the conversation that transpired between the Investigating Officer and the accused.
* The recovery of weapons from open spaces does not inspire confidence, and their seizure was wrongly relied upon as incriminating material.
* The prosecution did not procure any serological opinion to establish blood group on the recovered weapons.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
* The High Court was not justified in reversing the well-reasoned judgment of the trial Court, which recorded acquittal of the accused appellants.
* The impugned judgment dated 14th September, 2009 rendered by the High Court is hereby reversed.
* The accused appellants are acquitted of all charges and their bail bonds are discharged.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against a bail order granted to the appellant. The bail was initially granted on two grounds: (1) the appellant's implication based on statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act, which are inadmissible as per the decision in Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu; and (2) reliance on paragraph 15 of the decision in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant's lawyer argued for bail based on the grounds mentioned above, while the opposing party (likely the State) may have argued against bail or raised objections to certain conditions imposed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The court notes that the statements recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act are inadmissible and therefore cannot be used as a basis for implication.
* The court relies on paragraph 15 of the decision in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee, which outlines certain conditions to be met for bail.
* The court observes that it is not necessary to refer the case to a larger Bench for reconsideration of condition No. (iv) in paragraph 15.
* The court directs that two conditions in the order granting bail to the appellant - obtaining a certificate from the Embassy/High Commission and dropping a pin on Google Maps - shall be deleted.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
* Bail has been granted to the appellant on merits, based on the decision in Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu.
* The court directs that the two conditions mentioned above shall stand deleted from the order granting bail.
* The case is listed for passing final orders after considering the compliances made by the appellant so far.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the grant of refund of duty drawback to a respondent. The respondent made applications for refund in 1996, but the decision was taken belatedly on 07.10.2002, and payments were made by way of cheques on 31.03.2003 and 20.05.2003.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that there was no provision for payment of interest on delayed refund of duty drawback. However, the respondent contended that they were entitled to refund of duty drawback as a deemed export under the Duty Drawback Scheme and that the delay in refunding the amount entitled them to interest.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the respondent was entitled to refund of duty drawback as a deemed export under the Duty Drawback Scheme. The court also noted that there was considerable delay in refund of duty drawback, which entitled the respondent to interest.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the respondent was entitled to refund of duty drawback and interest at the rate fixed by the Central Government at the relevant point of time being fifteen percent. The court dismissed the appeal as there was no merit in it.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the conviction of a defendant for murder. The facts are based on the evidence presented during the trial, which included testimony from witnesses and physical evidence collected from the crime scene.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the defendant was guilty of murder and had intentionally killed the victim with premeditation. They presented evidence that showed the defendant had a history of violence and had previously threatened the victim.
The defense argued that the defendant acted in self-defense, citing the cultural and social background of the society to which they belonged. They claimed that the defendant's actions were provoked by the victim's behavior and that they regained their composure before killing the victim.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the evidence presented during the trial showed a clear intent on the part of the defendant to kill the victim. The number of gunshots fired, the location of the wounds, and the fact that the defendant made sure the victim was dead all pointed towards a premeditated murder.
The court also noted that the defense's argument of self-defense was not supported by the evidence presented. The defendant's actions were deemed to be calculated and deliberate rather than impulsive or provoked.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately dismissed the appeal, upholding the conviction of the defendant for murder. The judgment emphasized that the evidence presented clearly showed a premeditated and intentional killing, which did not fall under any exception to Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code. The defendant was directed to surrender to the trial court within four weeks.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of guidelines issued by a Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court regarding the exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC and Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The High Court had passed interim orders in certain cases, which were challenged before the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Learned Counsels for the respondents-accused submitted that the allegations made in the FIRs are of civil nature, given a color of criminal nature by the banks. They also argued that the borrower had filed complaints with ulterior motives after failing in proceedings under the SARFAESI Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the High Court's orders were in utter disregard and contravention of the guidelines issued by the Three-Judge Bench. The court also noted that the extraordinary and inherent powers of the court do not confer any arbitrary jurisdiction to act according to whims and caprice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court, holding them to be not in consonance with the settled legal position. The interim orders passed by the High Court qua the concerned respondents-accused were vacated forthwith. The court clarified that it had not expressed any opinion on the merits of the Writ Petitions pending before the High Court and that it would be open for the concerned respondents-accused to take all legal contentions or recourse to legal remedies as may be available in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the conviction of two appellants, A-1 and A-2, for a crime. The prosecution's case relies on the testimony of injured witnesses and the Investigation Officer. The FIR was filed with a delay, and there were interpolations on record. The medical and scientific evidence does not support the prosecution's version of events.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the appellants' convictions should be sustained based on the testimony of injured witnesses and the Investigation Officer. However, the defense argues that the prosecution case is weak due to various lapses in the investigation, inconsistencies among witnesses, and a lack of independent witnesses.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the prosecution's case is weakened by several factors, including a delay in filing the FIR, interpolations on record, numerous lapses in the investigation, and inconsistencies among witnesses. The medical and scientific evidence does not support the prosecution's version of events. The injured witnesses and the Investigation Officer do not inspire confidence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeals, sets aside the convictions, and directs both appellants to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. The pending applications, if any, are disposed of accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The first respondent was a judge of the district judiciary who was appointed to the High Court. She had served as a member of the district judiciary from 11 May 1981 to 31 July 2014 and then as a Judge of the High Court. The Union Government argued that her pension should be computed on the basis of her salary as a District Judge, whereas the respondent claimed that it should be based on her last drawn salary as a Judge of the High Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties were:
- The Union Government argued that the first respondent's pension should be computed on the basis of her salary as a District Judge, citing para 2(ii) of the letter dated September 19, 1984, which stated that the retiring Judge's entire service as a Judge has to be reckoned for the purpose of calculating his pension and for that purpose the last pay drawn by him has to be the pay drawn by him as a Judge of the High Court.
- The first respondent argued that her pension should be computed on the basis of her last drawn salary as a Judge of the High Court, citing Section 14A of the statute, which added ten years of service for Judges appointed from the Bar and para 2(a) of Schedule I to the High Courts Judges (Conditions of Service) Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court were:
- The court noted that acceptance of the Union Government's argument would discriminate against Judges of the High Court based on the source from which they are drawn.
- The court observed that a member of the Bar is entitled to the addition of ten years of service under Section 14A, and their pensionary benefits would be computed on the basis of their last drawn salary as a Judge of the High Court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court was:
- The first respondent was entitled to the addition of the period during which she served as a Judge of the High Court to her length of service as a member of the district judiciary.
- The pensionary payments should be computed on the basis of her last drawn salary as a Judge of the High Court.
- Arrears of pension were ordered to be payable to the first respondent on or before 31 March 2024 together with interest at the rate of 6% per annum.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a contempt petition filed against the State of Chhattisgarh and its authorities for issuing demand notices to the Petitioner Company despite the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra). The Petitioner Company had been issued a Resolution Plan by the Interim Resolution Professional, which was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The respondents/authorities had not raised any claim before the CoC, and the demand notices were issued despite the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) being brought to their notice.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the Petitioner are:

* The respondents/authorities are guilty of contempt for issuing demand notices to the Petitioner Company despite the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra).
* The continuance of the proceedings by the respondents/authorities even after the judgment of this Court was specifically brought to their notice is contemptuous in nature.
* The Resolution Plan as approved by the NCLT would still be binding on the State of Chhattisgarh and its authorities, despite them not being parties to the proceedings before the NCLT.

The respondents/authorities' arguments are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, they may have argued that:

* They were entitled to raise claims even after the judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) was brought to their notice.
* The continuance of proceedings does not amount to contempt.

However, these points are speculative and based on general knowledge of legal principles. They may not accurately reflect the actual arguments presented by the respondents/authorities.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Court in this case include:

* The judgment of this Court in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) is clear and unambiguous, specifically holding that stakeholders who do not raise claims before the CoC cannot proceed with recovery proceedings despite being aware of the judgment.
* Despite the judgment being brought to their notice, the respondents/authorities continued with the recovery proceedings, which amounts to contempt in the eyes of the law.
* The Court has shown leniency towards the respondents/authorities by not taking stern action against them, considering it one of the first cases arising out of the judgment in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) and also because they have tendered their unconditional apology.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court has held that:

* The continuance of proceedings by the respondents/authorities despite being aware of the judgment is contemptuous in nature, but it will not take any action against them considering the exceptional circumstances.
* The demand notices issued by the contemnors on the Petitioner Company and all proceedings pursuant thereto are declared to be illegal and quashed and set aside.
* The contempt petition is disposed of with acceptance of the unconditional apology tendered by the respondents/authorities.

The Court has accepted the unconditional apology offered by the respondents/authorities, choosing not to proceed against them. This decision is consistent with the observation that this was one of the first cases arising out of the judgment in Ghanshyam Mishra (supra) and the leniency shown by the Court towards the respondents/authorities.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a complaint under Section 143A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complainant had filed an application seeking grant of interim compensation from the accused, who was ordered to deposit Rs. 10,00,000/- as per the impugned order.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The main arguments raised by the parties were related to the interpretation of Section 143A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, and the discretion exercised by the trial court in granting interim compensation.
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the exercise of power under sub-section (1) of Section 143A is discretionary, and the provision is directory and not mandatory. The word "may" used in the provision cannot be construed as "shall."
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court held that:

*   The trial court had mechanically passed an order directing the accused to deposit Rs. 10,00,000/- without considering the issue of prima facie case and other relevant factors.
*   The direction was issued without application of mind by both the trial court and the High Court.
*   The Hon'ble Court directed the Trial Court to consider the application for grant of interim compensation afresh, and in the meanwhile, the amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- deposited by the accused would continue to remain deposited with the Trial Court.

Additionally, the Hon'ble Court summarized its conclusions as follows:

*   The exercise of power under sub-section (1) of Section 143A is discretionary.
*   While deciding the prayer made under Section 143A, the Court must record brief reasons indicating consideration of all relevant factors.
*   The broad parameters for exercising the discretion under Section 143A are:
    *   The Court will have to prima facie evaluate the merits of the case made out by the complainant and the merits of the defence pleaded by the accused in the reply to the application. The financial distress of the accused can also be a consideration.
    *   A direction to pay interim compensation can be issued, only if the complainant makes out a prima facie case.
    *   If the defence of the accused is found to be prima facie plausible, the Court may exercise discretion in refusing to grant interim compensation.
    *   If the Court concludes that a case is made out to grant interim compensation, it will also have to apply its mind to the quantum of interim compensation to be granted. While doing so, the Court will have to consider several factors such as the nature of the transaction, the relationship, if any, between the accused and the complainant, etc.
    *   There could be several other relevant factors in the peculiar facts of a given case, which cannot be exhaustively stated.

The Appeal was partly allowed on the above terms.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appeal of a decision made by the Division Bench of the High Court, which set aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge. The appeals were filed against the impugned judgment and order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the Division Bench committed an egregious error in interfering with the well-reasoned judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge. They contended that there was no good reason for the Division Bench to interfere with the judgment of the learned Single Judge.

The Division Bench had held that the compulsory acquisition of land under Section 24 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was not justified as it did not serve a public purpose.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the constitutional discourse on compulsory acquisitions has rooted itself within the "power of eminent domain." It noted that even within this articulation, two conditions are mandated: (i) acquisition for a public purpose and (ii) subjecting the divestiture to the payment of compensation in lieu of acquisition.

The court also stated that the binary reading of the constitutional right to property must give way to more meaningful renditions, where the larger right to property is seen as comprising intersecting sub-rights.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed both the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the Division Bench. It restored the judgment of the learned Single Judge. The court held that the Division Bench committed an egregious error in interfering with the well-reasoned judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge.
</JUDGMENT>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a writ petition (Writ Petition No. 5275 of 2021) filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, challenging an order passed by the High Court allowing the petition and setting aside an earlier order. The petition is related to a dispute between a Borrower and a bank, involving the DRT Act and the SARFAESI Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the appellants (the bank) argued against the High Court's decision to entertain and allow the writ petition despite the availability of an effective alternative remedy under the DRT Act and the SARFAESI Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The High Court has been criticized for ignoring the availability of statutory remedies under the DRT Act and the SARFAESI Act while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226.
* The court has emphasized the importance of caution, care, and circumspection in entertaining petitions arising out of the DRT Act and the SARFAESI Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:

* The appeal is allowed.
* The impugned order dated 4th February 2022 passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 5275 of 2021 is quashed and set aside.
* Writ Petition No. 5275 of 2021 is dismissed with costs quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- imposed upon the Borrower.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves HDFC Bank and two employees, Rakesh and Deepti. The bank had terminated the services of both employees due to alleged misconduct. Rakesh and Deepti filed suits in Patna and Delhi High Courts respectively against HDFC Bank. HDFC Bank claimed that the suits should have been instituted in a court in Mumbai as per the employment agreement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by HDFC Bank were based on Section 20 of the CPC (Code of Civil Procedure), which states that a contract cannot confer jurisdiction on a court that did not have such jurisdiction in the first place. HDFC Bank argued that since the decision to employ Rakesh and Deepti was taken in Mumbai, the appointment letter in favor of Rakesh was issued from Mumbai, the employment agreement was dispatched from Mumbai, the decision to terminate their services were taken in Mumbai, and the letters of termination were dispatched from Mumbai, the courts in Mumbai have jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include that the Patna High Court had correctly held in favor of HDFC Bank on the point of law but committed a fundamental error. The court noted that since the courts in Mumbai have the jurisdiction to decide the dispute, the proper course for the Patna High Court would have been to direct return of the plaint by the trial court under Order VII, Rule 10 of the CPC to Rakesh and Deepti for their presentation before the competent court in Mumbai.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court held that HDFC Bank is justified in its claim that the suits ought to have been instituted in an appropriate court in Mumbai. The court granted liberty to Rakesh and Deepti to present their respective plaints before the competent courts in Mumbai or institute fresh suits if they wish to do so. The impugned judgment and order of the Patna High Court was affirmed, and the connected appeal stands allowed.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves allegations of financial misconduct, misuse of position, and involvement in transactions constituting money laundering against the appellant.
The proceedings are at a preliminary stage, with the trial yet to begin.
The respondent has submitted material indicating the necessity of allowing the trial to proceed and not discharging the appellant at this stage.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argues that the proceedings are unwarranted and seeks an end to them at a preliminary stage.
The respondent counters by stating that cases involving economic offences necessitate a thorough trial to unearth the complete chain of events, financial transactions, and culpability of the accused.
The respondent also highlights the significance of allowing the trial to proceed in light of the statutory objectives and the continuing nature of the offence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case involves grave and serious allegations of financial misconduct and misuse of position.
The quantum of proceeds of crime involved far exceeds the statutory threshold, requiring proper investigation and judicial scrutiny.
Multiple judicial pronouncements emphasize the need for a thorough trial in cases involving economic offences to ensure accountability and justice.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court dismisses the appeal, upholding the decision to allow the trial to proceed.
The Court finds that the appellant has failed to establish any legally sustainable ground warranting interference at a pre-trial stage.
The legal framework under the PMLA serves as a crucial mechanism to ensure that individuals involved in laundering proceeds of crime are brought to justice and economic offences do not go unpunished.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the specific enforcement of an Agreement to Sell. The Respondent No.1-buyer had executed a sale deed in favor of the Appellant, but the Appellant challenged the specific enforcement of the Agreement to Sell.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court observed that the Appellant's main argument was that the Respondent No.1-buyer suppressed material facts regarding their refusal to accept a cheque sent by the Appellant, which would disentitle them from obtaining discretionary relief of specific performance.

Additionally, the Appellant argued that the Respondent No.1-buyer also failed to disclose their knowledge about the Appellant's intention not to perform the contract, which was a material fact that should have been disclosed.

The court also considered the principle of equitable remedies and held that where a plaintiff materially misleads the court or abuses its process, or attempts to do so, discretionary relief can be denied.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the suppression of material facts by the Respondent No.1-buyer was a significant issue in this case.

The court also noted that the Appellant had challenged the specific enforcement of the Agreement to Sell on grounds of non-disclosure and misrepresentation by the Respondent No.1-buyer.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the Agreement to Sell could not be specifically enforced due to the suppression of material facts by the Respondent No.1-buyer.

The impugned judgment dated 27th April, 2018, and decrees dated 10th May, 2018, and 09th May, 2024, were set aside.

The sale deed executed in favor of Respondent No.1-buyer was declared null and void, and the Appellant was directed to refund the balance sale consideration amount of Rs.24,61,000/- (Rupees Twenty Four Lakh Sixty One Thousand) deposited by Respondent No.1-buyer.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the sale of a share in an unpartitioned property. The respondents (Respondent Nos.1 to 3) had filed a suit, which was dismissed by the trial court on the grounds that it was barred by limitation. The First Appellate Court also upheld this decision. However, the High Court remanded the matter back to the trial court for fresh trial with respect to the issue of limitation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the failure of the trial court and the First Appellate Court to frame a specific issue on "limitation" did not cause any prejudice to the parties. They also contended that the question of limitation could be encompassed within the broader issue determined by the First Appellate Court for determination.
The respondents (Respondent Nos.1 to 3) had argued that they were not aware of the earlier proceedings and the decree passed in the first suit, which led to their delay in filing the suit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that limitation is a matter of statute and must be strictly enforced, especially when the earlier transaction or sale is well within the knowledge of the parties. The court also noted that protection of bona fide purchasers for value is a significant consideration, and any disturbance to their rights or titles after such a long period would create uncertainty in property transactions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court. The court held that the suit was barred by limitation and Respondent Nos.1 to 3 were not entitled to any relief. The judgment and decree of the trial court dismissing the suit, as affirmed by the First Appellate Court, were restored.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against the orders of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appellant had filed two appeals, the first one being accompanied with a certified copy supplied free by NCLT, and the second one without any certified copy.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case are related to the delay in filing the appeals. The Appellant argued that they were unable to obtain the certified copies of the orders within the specified time frame, which led to the delay in filing the appeals. They also claimed that exemption from filing a certified copy was available under the statutory requirements.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The Appellant had not applied for a certified copy of the orders, despite being aware that it was mandatory to file an appeal along with the certified copy as per Rule 22 of the NCLAT Rules.
- Exemption from filing a certified copy cannot be claimed as a matter of right in terms of the statutory requirements of the Rules.
- The period of limitation commences from the date of pronouncement of the order, and the benefit of Section 12(2) of the Limitation Act is available only on an application for grant of a certified copy of the Order having been filed till the date of preparation of the said certified copy.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the impugned order dated 18.01.2024 passed by the NCLAT and dismissed the present appeals, stating that:
- The appeals were filed beyond 30 days without any application for obtaining a certified copy of the order.
- There was no question of moving an application for condonation of delay when no application for obtaining a certified copy of the order had been filed.
The court also noted that the satisfaction of the Appellate Tribunal to dismiss the application for condonation of delay was justified, as there were no justifiable grounds pleaded by the Appellant.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves several Civil Appeals (3957-3963 of 2023) filed by appellants seeking relief from the decision of the Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court. The appeals pertain to the eligibility of the appellants under the Non-Creamy Layer (NCL) category for certain appointments. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they possessed valid NCL certificates, but these were deemed invalid by the competent authority due to delays in their issuance or some other reasons. They relied on the 2-Judge Bench decision of Ram Kumar Gijroya (supra) and contended that their appeals should be allowed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the appellants had not produced valid certificates accompanied by affidavits at the relevant time as per the requirements. The Court also noted that none of the appellants claimed to have already established their eligibility or applied for NCL category certificates, which would have made the relied judgment applicable.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the correct position of law is not in favor of the Appellants and relying on precedents and provisions of law governing the circumstances before them, the appeals should be declared devoid of merit. Consequently, the Civil Appeals were dismissed while upholding the decision rendered by the Division Bench of Rajasthan High Court as good in law.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involved a recruitment process for D.El.Ed. examination conducted in 2020-22, which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The recruitment notification dated 21.10.2022 provided an opportunity for candidates who had completed their D.El.Ed. course by that date.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the cut-off date for eligibility should be the last date for receiving applications, which was the date of the recruitment notification. They relied on the principles laid down in Bhupinderpal Singh (supra) and subsequent decisions as referred to in Rakesh Kumar Sharma (supra) and Tej Prakash (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was no illegality or arbitrariness in the recruitment notification dated 21.10.2022, and that it had commenced under the relevant rules and as per the directions of the single Judge of the High Court disposing of the writ petition.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment of the division bench in M.A.T. No. 1725 of 2022 dated 11.04.2023. It directed that the recruitment process, which commenced under the notification dated 21.10.2022, must proceed further and the Board must take immediate steps for concluding the recruitment process as expeditiously as possible.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between an appellant railway and the respondent company over the chargeable distance for transporting goods from Refinery Baad to Hisar. The original chargeable distance was 444 km, but it was later revised to 333.18 km after reworking by the railways. The respondent company had made payment for the original 444 km distance.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellant railway include:
(i) That the change in methodology would not have resulted in a huge difference of 110 km,
(ii) There was no change in the route or physical track length, and
(iii) The letter dated 05.07.2005 indicates that the change in the chargeable distance was due to an error.
The respondent company's arguments are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Key observations made by the court include:
- The effect of changing methodology on the chargeable distance would be at best limited or confined to a difference of 1 km for each intervening station,
- There was no change in the route or physical track length, and
- The letter dated 05.07.2005 indicates that the change in the chargeable distance was due to an error.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court has ruled that the original chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal, citing the following reasons:
(i) The effect of changing methodology on the chargeable distance would not have resulted in a huge difference of 110 km,
(ii) There had been neither any change in the route by way of addition of new station nor change in the physical track length of the said route,
(iii) The letter dated 05.07.2005 itself indicates that the change in the chargeable distance of 444 km was due to an error and has no bearing with the Ministry of Railway's letter dated 07.04.2004 introducing the new methodology,
(iv) The factum of the appellants themselves granting refund without explaining the reason for the same, despite their stance that the respondent is not entitled to any refund, and
(v) The failure of the appellant in establishing that the chargeable distance of 444 km was the correct chargeable distance as per the law.
The court has dismissed the appeals filed by the appellant railway.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves respondent Nos. 3 to 13 who were released from prison due to remission orders that have been quashed by the court. They had served over fourteen years in prison, including liberal paroles and furloughs.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argues that rule of law must prevail in this case. The respondents cannot seek remission when they are on bail or outside the jail. The impugned orders of remission are set aside by the court, and therefore, the natural consequences must follow.
The court also emphasizes that the principle of equal protection of law as enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution is applicable in this case. The deprivation of liberty for respondent Nos. 3 to 13 is justified since they were released from prison erroneously and contrary to law.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the faith of the people in the purity of the fountain of justice must be maintained. The primary duty and highest responsibility of the court is to correct arbitrary orders at the earliest and maintain confidence in the rule of law.
The court also notes that Article 142 of the Constitution cannot be invoked by them in favor of respondent Nos. 3 to 13, as it would be an instance of the court's imprimatur to ignore rule of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court passes the following orders:
- Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 491 of 2022 is allowed in the aforesaid terms.
- Other writ petitions stand disposed of.
- Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
- Respondent Nos. 3 to 13 are directed to report to the concerned jail authorities within two weeks from today.

<FACTS>
The Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) was established in 1920. The case revolves around the interpretation of Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, which grants rights to minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are as follows:

*   The AMU challenged the judgment in Azeez Basha (1993), which held that only a minority community can be associated with a university established by them, not any other group.
*   The court considered various provisions of the Constitution, including Article 30, and its implications on the rights of minorities to establish educational institutions.
*   The parties also discussed the concept of 'minority' under the Indian Constitution and its relation to educational institutions.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court in this case are as follows:

*   The court noted that Article 30 is not absolute and does not exist in a silo. It has substantial interplay, intermixing, and balancing of rights with other fundamental rights.
*   The crux of Article 30(1) lies in its mandate to ensure parity between non-minority (or 'neutral') institutions and minority institutions.
*   The court observed that the provision underscores that no specific category or type of institution should be disadvantaged or unduly favoured over another within the legal framework.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The reference is answered in the above terms. The matters may be placed before an appropriate bench as per the prevailing rules.

 NOVEMBER 08, 2024
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Entry 50 - List II of the Indian Constitution, which pertains to taxation. The matter concerns the power of the State legislature to impose taxes and whether such powers are subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The majority decision in Kesoram was criticized for deviating from the law laid down by a seven-judge Bench in India Cement, which held that royalty is not a tax. The judgment argued that this departure was unwarranted and therefore liable to be overruled.
The court analyzed the provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957, specifically Sections 9, 9A, and 25, which denude or limit the scope of Entry 50 - List II. It was held that taxes on lands and buildings under Entry 49 - List II contemplate a tax levied directly on the land as a unit having a defined relationship with the land.
The court also considered the declaration made in terms of Entry 54 - List I, which to some extent, denuded the State legislature's powers under Entry 50 - List II. 
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed that Entry 50 - List II is a unique Entry as it is the only taxation Entry in Lists I and II where the taxing power of a State legislature has been subjected to "any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development".
The scope of expression "any limitations" in Entry 50 - List II was held to be wide enough to include the imposition of restrictions, conditions, principles as well as a prohibition.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgments in India Cement, Orissa Cement, Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills, Saurasthra Cement, Mahanadi Coalfields, and Kannadasan (excluding to the extent overruled in Tata Iron and Steel) were held to be correct and binding precedent. 
On the other hand, the majority judgment in Kesoram was overruled to the extent it holds that royalty is not a tax.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Entry 8 in List II of the IDRA (Indian Drugs and Cosmetics Rules), which deals with "intoxicating liquors". The court is examining whether Section 18G of the IDRA, which deals with denatured alcohol, falls under this entry.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that denatured alcohol does not fall under the category of intoxicating liquors and therefore, Section 18G of the IDRA should be read as occupying a field of legislation distinct from Entry 33(a) in List III. The respondents argued that denatured alcohol is covered by Entry 8 in List II and therefore, Parliament alone has the power to legislate on this matter.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the judgment in Synthetics (7J) does not apply to Section 18G of the IDRA. The court also noted that Item 26 of the First Schedule to the IDRA must be read as excluding the industry "intoxicating liquor" and that the judgment in Tika Ramji is not good law on the interpretation of the word 'industry' in Legislative entries.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that denatured alcohol is covered by Entry 8 in List II, and therefore, Section 18G of the IDRA occupies the field under Entry 33(a) - List III. The court further observed that only Parliament has the power to legislate on all articles or class of articles related to a scheduled industry i.e., "Fermentation Industries".
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes for the purposes of reservation. The reference was made to the Supreme Court to determine whether sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is permissible in law for the purposes of reservation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments in favor of sub-classification:

*   The system of reservation as prevailing may continue to occupy the field with power to permit sub-classification of a class particularly scheduled caste.
*   Reservation, if any, has to be limited only for the first generation or one generation and if any generation in the family has taken advantage of the reservation and have achieved higher status, the benefit of reservation would not be logically available to the second generation.

Arguments against sub-classification:

*   No new method is evolved or adopted, the system of reservation as prevailing may continue to occupy the field.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations from the case:
*   The country has moved into a casteless society except for the deeming provision under the Constitution for the limited purposes of affording reservation to the depressed class of persons, downtrodden or belonging to SC/ST/OBC.
*   Any facility or privilege for the promotion of the above categories of persons has to be on totally different criteria other than the caste may be on economic or financial factors, status of living, vocation and the facilities available to each one of them based upon their place of living (urban or rural).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Judgment:
*   The reference is accordingly answered and it is held that sub-classification of scheduled castes is permissible in law for the purposes of reservation.
*   Any exercise involving sub-classification by the State, must be supported by empirical data that ought to underscore the more 'disadvantaged' status of the sub-group to which such preferential treatment is sought to be provided vis-à-vis the Constitutional Class as a whole.
*   The identification of the 'creamy layer' qua Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ought to become a constitutional imperative for the State.
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Article 38, 39(b) and (c) of the Indian Constitution. The court is considering whether these provisions can be applied to privately owned resources.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court cites Ranganatha Reddy and Sanjeev Coke cases which gave a broad and inclusive meaning to the expression "material resources of the community". This interpretation has been relevant in addressing social and economic inequalities in India. The court also notes that despite changes in situations, the inequality remains.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations suggest that the court is concerned about the growing gap between the rich and the poor in India, and the need to address this inequality through the principles enshrined in Articles 38 and 39. The court also expresses disapproval of harsh criticism on the Krishna Iyer Doctrine.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment emphasizes that the incorporation of Article 38 as well as Article 39(b) and (c) in Part IV of the Indian Constitution was based on the prevalent philosophy of the time. The court reaffirms the principles enshrined in these provisions, particularly the broad and inclusive meaning given to the expression "material resources of the community". The judgment concludes by stating that it is essential to address social and economic inequalities in India.

The case involves a writ petition filed by an unknown petitioner, which is not specified in the provided text. The case revolves around the actions of the Governor and the State Government in withholding assent to certain legislation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the petitioner argued that the Governor and the State Government acted contrary to the spirit of the Constitution by withholding assent to the legislation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations were made regarding the importance of upholding the spirit of the Constitution and the role of constitutional functionaries in serving the people. The court also referred to a historical snippet where Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, accepted the opinion of the Attorney General on the constitutional role of the President.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the Registry to send one copy each of the judgment to all the High Courts and the Principal Secretaries to the Governors of all States. The present writ petition was disposed of in the aforesaid terms, with pending applications also being disposed of.

Additionally, the court made several observations on the importance of upholding the Constitution and the role of constitutional functionaries:

* The soul of India is its Constitution.
* The Constitution guarantees rights and sets benchmarks for responsibilities.
* Constitutional functionaries should exercise their powers by and under the Constitution and show deference to the people who have given the Constitution to themselves.

The court also referred to a quote from Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, which states: "However good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it happen to be a good lot."

Finally, the court expressed hope and trust that the Governor and the State Government would work in tandem and harmoniously keeping the interests and well-being of the people as their paramount consideration.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two appeals filed by the appellants, challenging the orders of the Trial Courts and the High Court in regards to their trials under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The accused persons were dealing with substances that are only mentioned under the Schedule to the NDPS Act and absent from Schedule I of the NDPS Rules.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case include:

*   The retrospective application of the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) would be necessary considering the facts and circumstances.
*   Giving retrospective effect to the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) would not give rise to any implications as regards the rights of the accused persons under Article 20(1) of the Constitution.
*   The overruling of a decision cannot be equated to the enactment of an ex-post facto law, especially when the interpretation given to the statute/provision in the overruling decision is not a novel and unreasonably expansive interpretation of the provision in question such that it was completely unforeseeable.

The Trial Courts committed errors in holding that the offence under the provisions of the NDPS Act is not made out. The Trial Courts could not have discharged/deleted the charge under the NDPS Act framed against the accused persons while disposing of an application under Section 216 CrPC, which is not permissible within the criminal procedure.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

*   The decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) must be given retrospective effect.
*   Acquittals that have already been recorded as a consequence of the decision in Rajesh Kumar Gupta (supra) and have attained finality, would not be unsettled in light of the overruling decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) or the observations made by us.

</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in the case includes:

*   The Trial Courts are directed to proceed with the trial and conclude it expeditiously.
*   We allow both the appeals filed by the appellants and set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court.
*   The Registry is directed to send one copy each of this judgment to all the High Courts.
*   Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.

The Model Prison Manual 2016 and the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act 2023 were challenged for containing provisions that perpetuated caste-based discrimination.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the petitioners included:
* The impugned provisions in the prison manuals/acts are violative of Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 of the Constitution.
* Caste-based categorization and treatment of prisoners is unconstitutional and discriminatory.
* References to "habitual offenders" in the prison manuals/Model Prison Manual should be defined in accordance with the definition provided in the habitual offender legislation enacted by the respective State legislatures.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case deals with the validity of arbitration agreements that enable one party to unilaterally constitute an arbitral tribunal. The court is examining whether such clauses inspire confidence in establishing an independent and impartial tribunal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments made by the court:
- Dispute resolution through arbitration encompasses two principles: contractual freedom as party autonomy and statutory obligation as duty to constitute an independent arbitral tribunal.
- Party autonomy in making an arbitration agreement is essential, but it does not override the public policy requirement of establishing an independent and impartial tribunal.
- Arbitration agreements which are not compliant with this public policy consideration are void under Section 23 of the Contract Act.
- The court has the power to ensure that the arbitration agreement inspires confidence and enables establishment of an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court:
- The moment parties choose arbitration over ordinary civil proceedings, their duty to establish an independent and impartial tribunal arises.
- Arbitration agreements enabling one party to unilaterally constitute an arbitral tribunal do not inspire confidence in independence and may violate public policy requirements.
- The occasion for the court to examine the constitution of the independent and impartial tribunal under the arbitration clause will arise when one of the parties makes an application under Sections 11, 14 or 34.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment made by the court:
- The arbitration agreement is valid only if it enables establishment of an independent and impartial tribunal. If not, any submission that the said agreement is a binding contract or it is in exercise of party autonomy is not tenable as such an agreement will be against public policy.
- In view of the statutory incorporation of duties to constitute an independent and impartial tribunal, it is not necessary to apply public law principles evolved in constitutional and administrative laws.
- The court has the power to ensure that the arbitration agreement inspires confidence and enables establishment of an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal. This principle is recognised and statutorily incorporated in the Contract Act and the Arbitration Act.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around reassessment notices issued by the Income Tax Department to taxpayers. The court is considering whether these notices are valid and whether the department has exceeded its time limit for issuing such notices.
The court notes that the Income Tax Act, 1961, provides a timeframe of three years from the end of an assessment year for granting approval under Section 151(1) of the Act. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, this timeframe was extended to June 30, 2021.
Additionally, the court mentions that a large number of reassessment notices were issued between April 1 and June 30, 2021, when the department's instructions to stay show-cause notices were in effect. The court is considering whether these notices are valid and whether the taxpayers should be granted relief.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The government argues that the reassessment notices were issued within the time limit provided under the Income Tax Act, 1961. They also argue that the extension of the timeframe for granting approval under Section 151(1) was a one-time measure to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On the other hand, the taxpayers argue that the reassessment notices were issued after the department's instructions to stay show-cause notices were withdrawn. They also argue that the department exceeded its time limit for issuing such notices and therefore the notices are invalid.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the Income Tax Department has exceeded its power by issuing a large number of reassessment notices within a short period. The court notes that this would cause undue hardship to taxpayers who were not given sufficient time to respond to the show-cause notices.
Additionally, the court mentions that the department's instructions to stay show-cause notices created confusion among taxpayers and caused them unnecessary distress.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeals filed by the taxpayers. The court holds that the reassessment notices issued between April 1 and June 30, 2021 are invalid as they were issued after the department's instructions to stay show-cause notices were withdrawn. The court also holds that the department exceeded its time limit for issuing such notices.
The court sets aside the judgments of the High Courts rendered in Union of India v. Rajeev Bansal and other similar cases, to the extent of the observations made in this judgment.
The transfer petitions are disposed of, and pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.

The State Bar Councils (SBCs) were charging enrolment fees beyond the express legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act, 1961. The petitioners challenged this practice, alleging that it violated Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that:
* Section 24(1)(f) specifically lays down the fiscal pre-conditions subject to which an advocate can be enrolled on State rolls. The SBCs and the BCI cannot demand payment of fees other than the stipulated enrolment fee and stamp duty, if any, as a pre-condition to enrolment.
* The decision of the SBCs to charge fees and charges at the time of enrolment in excess of the legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f) violates Article 14 (Equality before the law) and Article 19(1)(g) (Right to practice any profession or occupation).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* The SBCs' practice of charging excess enrolment fees is unconstitutional.
* The Advocates Welfare Fund Act, 2001 requires the SBCs to pay annually an amount equal to twenty per cent of the enrolment fee received by it under Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act, 1961.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The SBCs cannot charge "enrolment fees" beyond the express legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f).
* Section 24(1)(f) specifically lays down the fiscal pre-conditions subject to which an advocate can be enrolled on State rolls.
* The decision of the SBCs to charge fees and charges at the time of enrolment in excess of the legal stipulation under Section 24(1)(f) violates Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g).
* This judgment will have prospective effect. The SBCs are not required to refund the excess enrolment fees collected before the date of this judgment.

The case was brought by a petition filed in the High Court, challenging the constitutional validity of Section 15(1).
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that Section 15(1) is unconstitutional because it does not provide for any exceptions or defenses for possession or storage of CSEAM. They contended that this provision violates the right to privacy and freedom of speech guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.
The respondent, the State, argued that Section 15(1) is a necessary measure to protect children from sexual exploitation and that it does not infringe on any fundamental rights.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the petitioner's argument was based on an incorrect interpretation of the provision. It held that Section 15(1) only makes possession or storage of CSEAM punishable, but does not make it an offense to possess or store child pornography in general.
The court also noted that the respondent's argument that Section 15(1) is a necessary measure to protect children from sexual exploitation was not supported by any evidence. It stated that the provision could be amended to provide for exceptions and defenses for possession or storage of CSEAM without affecting its purpose.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court, holding that Section 15(1) of POCSO is unconstitutional. It ruled that the provision violates the right to privacy and freedom of speech guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. The court directed the Parliament to amend Section 15(1) to provide for exceptions and defenses for possession or storage of CSEAM.
The Supreme Court also made several observations regarding the need for a comprehensive program or mechanism to educate children about healthy relationships, consent, and appropriate behavior. It emphasized the importance of raising awareness among children, educators, healthcare professionals, law enforcement officers, and the general public about the realities of child sexual exploitation material (CSEAM) and its consequences.

<FACTS>
The ACC Unit/project was of OPG, Gita Power. The holding company of OPG actively participated in the formation of the contract for the project. Enexio placed purchase order(s) on the ACC Unit and made advance payment(s), which were subsequently affirmed by OPG. This led to the arbitral tribunal holding that Gita Power was bound by the arbitration agreement and jointly and severally liable along with OPG to pay the awarded amount.
The claim of Enexio was an indivisible claim for compensation in lieu of goods supplied, and work done, based on breach of the contract. The limitation for the claim was governed by Article 55, not Articles 14, 18, and 113, of the Schedule to the 1963 Act.
The claimant's claim for the outstanding principal amount matured on 19 March 2016. Even if we count limitation from 21 September 2015 (as found by the Tribunal), it will have no material bearing on the award.
The limitation for the claim as well as counterclaims, other than those relating to cost of repair/replacement of gear boxes and fan modules, stood extended under Section 18 of the 1963 Act, based on acknowledgement made in the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018. Those were within limitation as on the date of commencement of arbitration (i.e., 2 May 2019) and filing counterclaim (i.e., 15 July 2019).
The counterclaims qua cost of repair/replacement of gear boxes and fan modules were rightly held barred by time, as in respect thereof there was no recital in the minutes of meeting dated 19 April 2018.
Rejection of prayer to declare debit notes invalid on ground of limitation had no adverse impact on claimant's claim for compensation, which was well within the extended period of limitation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
There are no explicit arguments mentioned in the given text. The document appears to be a judgment from the Indian Supreme Court, discussing the case and providing conclusions rather than presenting opposing arguments.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The arbitral tribunal's decision was upheld by the High Court, which set aside the judgment and order of the Single Judge and restored the arbitral award. The appeal(s) fail and are hereby dismissed. Parties to bear their own costs.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment concludes that there is no palpable error in the arbitral award as to be termed 'patently illegal' / 'perverse', or in conflict with public policy of India. The Division Bench of the High Court was justified in setting aside the judgment and order of the Single Judge and restoring the arbitral award.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Articles 105 and 194 of the Indian Constitution, which pertain to the privileges and immunities of members of Parliament and State Legislatures.
A member of a legislature is alleged to have engaged in bribery, and the question arises whether such an act can be considered as a breach of parliamentary privilege.
The case involves a reference from the High Court to the Supreme Court for clarification on the interpretation of the constitutional provisions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the parties involved are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, based on the context, it appears that the arguments revolved around the following points:
* Whether bribery is an essential part of casting a vote or making a speech in the legislature
* The scope and purpose of Articles 105 and 194 regarding parliamentary privileges
* Whether the jurisdiction of the court to prosecute a member of the legislature for bribery can coexist with the authority of the House to discipline its members
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that:
* Bribery erodes probity in public life, which is essential for the functioning of democratic institutions.
* The jurisdiction of the court and the authority of the House exist in distinct spheres, with different scopes and consequences.
* The interpretation placed on the issue by the majority judgment in PV Narasimha Rao (supra) leads to a paradoxical outcome where a legislator is conferred immunity when they accept a bribe but follow through with voting in the agreed direction.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
* Bribery is not an essential part of casting a vote or making a speech in the legislature and cannot be considered as a breach of parliamentary privilege under Articles 105 and 194.
* The jurisdiction of the court to prosecute a member of the legislature for bribery can coexist with the authority of the House to discipline its members.
The reference is answered in the above terms, and the Criminal Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a contempt petition filed against the borrower and subsequent transferee for violating court orders. The secured asset was sold to the petitioner through an auction, but the borrower and subsequent transferee challenged the sale. The court had earlier passed orders directing the bank to cancel the release deed and assignment agreement.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given case. However, it can be inferred that the petitioner argued in favor of the validity of the 9th auction proceedings and the sale of the secured asset. The borrower and subsequent transferee likely argued against the validity of the auction proceedings and the sale.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the contempt petition was maintainable as the borrower and subsequent transferee had wilfully disobeyed the court orders. The court also noted that the sale of the secured asset to the petitioner was valid, and the title conferred through the Sale Certificate dated 27.09.2023 is absolute.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court passed the following directions:
- The legality and validity of the 9th auction proceedings conducted pursuant to the notice of sale dated 12.06.2022 is upheld, and the sale of the secured asset to the petitioner is confirmed.
- The title conferred through the Sale Certificate dated 27.09.2023 is declared to be absolute.
- The Borrower and the Bank shall immediately take steps for the cancellation of the Release Deed dated 28.08.2023 within a period of one week from the date of pronouncement.
- The Assignment Agreement dated 28.08.2023 is hit by lis pendens and hereby declared void.
- The Subsequent Transferee shall hand over the peaceful physical possession of the Secured Asset along with its original title deeds to the Bank within a period of one week from the date of pronouncement.
- The Bank shall refund the amount of Rs. 129 crore paid by the Borrower towards the redemption of mortgage without any interest only after the aforesaid directions have been complied to the letter and spirit.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals against the decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) regarding the approval of a combination under Section 31(1) of the Competition Act, 2002. The appellants challenged the NCLAT's order approving the proposed combination between HNGIL and AGI.
The CCI had approved the combination on September 7, 2020, subject to certain conditions. However, the objectors appealed against this decision before the NCLAT, which set aside the CCI's approval on February 18, 2021.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the NCLAT erred in setting aside the CCI's order approving the combination without considering the relevant market and its definition. They also contended that the NCLAT failed to consider the correct turnover of the companies and incorrectly calculated the combined market share.
The objectors, on the other hand, argued that the CCI did not properly assess the impact of the proposed combination on competition in the relevant market. They claimed that the CCI's approval was based on incomplete information and incorrect assumptions about the product outflow from the acquirer and target.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the NCLAT had correctly set aside the CCI's order approving the combination, as it failed to consider the relevant market and its definition. The Court also noted that the objectors' concerns about the impact of the proposed combination on competition in the relevant market were valid.
The Court emphasized that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has a crucial role to play in promoting competition and protecting consumers' interests. It observed that the CCI's decision-making process must be transparent, fair, and based on accurate information.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the NCLAT's order setting aside the CCI's approval of the combination. The Court held that the CCI had correctly assessed the impact of the proposed combination on competition in the relevant market and that its decision was based on accurate information.
The Court also observed that the NCLAT erred in not considering the correct turnover of the companies and incorrectly calculating the combined market share. However, it noted that the objectors' concerns about the product outflow from the acquirer and target were valid.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals filed by the objectors and upheld the CCI's approval of the combination.

The case revolves around the jurisdiction of proper officers to issue show cause notices under Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962. The issue was raised in several connected review petitions and civil appeals.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the respondents argued against the jurisdiction of certain officers to issue show cause notices under Section 28, while the petitioners argued in favor of their jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Several key observations were made during the case:
* The Court upheld the constitutional validity of Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022.
* The High Court of Delhi's decision in Mangali Impex (supra) was set aside, and the view taken by the High Court of Bombay in Sunil Gupta (supra) was upheld.
* The Court allowed the Review Petition No. 400/2021 titled Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. and connected review petitions insofar as the issue of jurisdiction of proper officers to issue show cause notices under Section 28 is concerned.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellant society and the respondents, who are employees of the school administered by the appellant society. The respondents claimed that their salary and service conditions were not maintained as per what was payable to teachers in Government institutions, citing the doctrine of legitimate expectation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondents argued that the doctrine of legitimate expectation applies to this case because the appellant society is performing a public function by imparting education, and therefore, they have a legitimate expectation that their salary and service conditions will be maintained as per what is payable to teachers in Government institutions. They also claimed that an express or implied promise was made by the appellant society regarding keeping their salary and service conditions intact.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the doctrine of legitimate expectation is a device created to maintain a check on arbitrariness in state action, but it does not extend to contracts between private parties. It also noted that the relationship between the administration of the institution and its employees remains a contractual one, falling within the ambit of private law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the doctrine of legitimate expectation has no applicability to this case because there was no express or implied promise made by the appellant society regarding keeping their salary and service conditions intact. It also found that there were no past negotiations or dealings between the respondents and the appellant society, and therefore, they cannot invoke the doctrine of legitimate expectation. The Court further observed that even if the function being performed by a private educational institution is considered as a public function, the relationship between the administration of such an institution and its employees remains a contractual one.

<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal related to a public auction under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The subject property was put up for e-auction twice, with an average liquidation value of ₹39,41,28,800/- in the first round and ₹29,55,96,375/- in the second round. The difference between the two figures is approximately ₹10,00,00,000/-. The Auction Purchaser retained the balance sale consideration for over six months from 10th February, 2020, and about five months from 25th March, 2020.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the auction was not conducted fairly, and the Sale Deed should be declared void. The respondents, on the other hand, contended that the Auction Purchaser had failed to pay the balance sale consideration in a timely manner.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that repeated interferences in public auctions can cause uncertainty and frustrate the purpose of holding auctions. The court also noted that once an auction is confirmed, it should be interfered with on fairly limited grounds.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directed the Auction Purchaser to pay an additional amount in respect of the subject property. To arrive at a just and fair figure, the court proposed to take into consideration the estimated value of the subject property as per the Reports submitted by the Registered Valuers appointed by the Liquidator. The court fixed ₹5,00,00,000/- (Rupees Five crore only) as the additional amount to be deposited by the Auction Purchaser with interest @ 9 % p.a. reckoned from 26th March, 2020 till date of actual payment.

The case revolves around a dispute between the appellants and the respondent-CBI. The appellants were accused of profiting from the sale of coal rejects, which allegedly had a commercial value, and pocketing the sale proceeds. However, the appellants claimed that the coal rejects did not have any useful commercial value.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent-CBI relied on an Audit Report by the CAG to initiate a criminal inquiry against the appellants. The CBI's case was built around the premise that the coal rejects had a commercial value and that the appellants profited from their sale in the open market.
The appellants argued that the underpinnings of what was a civil dispute premised on a contract between the parties, breach whereof could at best lead to determination of the contract or even the underlying lease deed, has been painted with the brush of criminality without any justification.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court noted that the respondent-CBI embarked on a "roving and fishing inquiry" based on the Audit Report and started working backwards to sniff out criminal intent against the appellants. The court observed that the underpinnings of what was a civil dispute were misinterpreted by the CBI.
The court also mentioned that the new technology (FBC) for utilizing coal rejects was not even in vogue when the Mining Plan was approved, and several steps were required to be undertaken before putting it to use. However, an order was passed deallocating all captive coal mines, which prevented these steps from being taken.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the impugned orders (order on charge dated 24th December, 2021 and the order framing charges dated 3rd March, 2022) were unsustainable and accordingly quashed and set aside. The court observed that there were glaring infirmities in the case presented by the respondent-CBI.

<Facts>
The case revolves around the interpretation of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (CGST Act). The petitioners, who are engaged in various businesses including a shopping mall, have challenged the constitutional validity of these provisions. They argue that the provisions are arbitrary and violate their right to equality.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners' main argument is that the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d) cannot be given the same meaning as the expression "plant and machinery" defined by the explanation to Section 17. They contend that this interpretation would lead to ambiguity and uncertainty, causing prejudice to their businesses.
The petitioners also argue that the question of whether a building, such as a shopping mall, can be classified as a plant within the meaning of Section 17(5)(d) is a factual question that needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. They suggest that if the construction of the building was essential for carrying out their business activities, it could be considered a plant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the challenge to the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the CGST Act is not established. The court also notes that the expression "plant or machinery" used in Section 17(5)(d) cannot be given the same meaning as the expression "plant and machinery" defined by the explanation to Section 17.
The court further observes that whether a building, such as a shopping mall, can be classified as a plant within the meaning of Section 17(5)(d) is a factual question that needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The court suggests that the functionality test will have to be applied to decide whether a building is a plant.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that the challenge to the constitutional validity of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 17(5) and Section 16(4) of the CGST Act is not established. The court upholds the interpretation of these provisions as valid.
The court also holds that whether a building, such as a shopping mall, can be classified as a plant within the meaning of Section 17(5)(d) is a factual question that needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The court suggests that the petitioners may raise this issue in appropriate proceedings where adjudication can be made on facts.
The writ petitions are rejected subject to the interpretation of clause (d) of sub-section (5) of Section 17 of the CGST Act made by the court.

The Madarsa Act was enacted by the State legislature to regulate the standard of education in Madarsas recognized by the Board for imparting Madarsa education. The provisions of the Madarsa Act that pertain to higher-education degrees, such as Fazil and Kamil, were challenged on grounds of conflict with the UGC Act, which has been enacted under Entry 66 of List I.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:
* The Madarsa Act is consistent with the positive obligation of the State to ensure that students studying in recognized Madarsas attain a level of competency that will allow them to effectively participate in society and earn a living.
* Article 21-A and the RTE Act have to be read consistently with the right of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.
* The Board with the approval of the State government can enact regulations to ensure that religious minority institutions impart secular education of a requisite standard without destroying their minority character.
* The Madarsa Act is within the legislative competence of the State legislature and traceable to Entry 25 of List III.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed:
* The purpose behind the Madarsa Act was to remove the difficulties in running the Madarsas, improve their merit, and provide adequate facilities to students studying in these institutions.
* The provisions relating to higher education can be severed from the rest of the statute without impacting its entire character.
* The legislative intent on the question of separability can be determined by taking into account the history of the legislation, its object, title, and preamble.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* Only the provisions which pertain to Fazil and Kamil are unconstitutional as they are in conflict with the UGC Act, which has been enacted under Entry 66 of List I.
* The Madarsa Act otherwise remains valid.
* The judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 22 March 2024 is accordingly set aside, and the petitions shall stand disposed of in the above terms.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Rule 2(k) of the CENVAT Rules, which defines "input" for the purpose of credit benefits. The Assessee, a Mobile Service Provider (MSP), claimed that towers and pre-fabricated buildings (PFBs) used for providing mobile telecommunication services are inputs under Rule 2(k). The issue arose when the Central Excise Authority rejected the claim.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Assessee argued that towers and PFBs are goods used for providing output service, as they enable the transmission of radio signals to subscribers. In support of their argument, they cited sub-clause (ii) of Rule 2(k), which defines "input" as all goods except light diesel oil, high speed diesel oil, motor spirit, commonly known as petrol and motor vehicles, used for providing any output service.

The CESTAT rejected the Assessee's plea by observing that towers are immovable structures and thus non-marketable and non-excisable. They also held that Explanation-2 to Rule 2(k), which provides that input includes goods used in the manufacture of capital goods which are further used in the factory of the manufacturer, does not apply.

The Assessee appealed against this decision, arguing that the CESTAT's view was incorrect and that towers and PFBs qualify as inputs under Rule 2(k).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Delhi High Court upheld the judgment rendered by it in Vodafone (supra) and dismissed the connected appeals. In contrast, the Bombay High Court set aside its own judgment in Bharti Airtel (supra) and allowed the connected appeals.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately held that towers and PFBs are "goods" and not immovable property. Since these goods are used for providing mobile telecommunication services, they qualify as "inputs" under Rule 2(k). Consequently, all the appeals and connected applications were disposed of in terms of this finding.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case is related to a challenge against the sanction for prosecution under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA). The appellant is a director of a company that allegedly committed an offense. However, the appellant claims that he was not in charge of the affairs of the company and that his identity has been stolen by others.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argues that the sanction for prosecution under UAPA should be challenged at the earliest instance available, preferably before the Trial Court. The appellant also contends that the timelines mentioned in Rules 3 & 4 of the 2008 Rules are couched in mandatory language and must be strictly followed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that if a challenge to the sanction is raised at an appellate stage, it would be for the person raising the challenge to justify the reasons for bringing the same at a belated stage. The court also notes that independent review by both the authority recommending sanction and the authority granting sanction are necessary aspects of compliance with Section 45 of the UAPA.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concludes that the appeal lacks merit and is dismissed. The court prudently leaves it for the Trial Court to decide on issues such as whether Sections 218-222, CrPC, are violated or whether the exemption under Section 22A applies, as these require analysis of facts.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the maintainability of an anticipatory bail application filed by an accused who is already in judicial custody in a different offence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Mr. Luthra argued that the issue at hand has already been dealt with and decided by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra).
However, it was contended that the dictum laid therein is that an anticipatory bail application filed by an accused in a different case, while he is in custody in one case, would not be maintainable.
Mr. Luthra also argued that the issue of maintainability of an application for grant of anticipatory bail by an accused who is already in judicial custody in relation to some offence had not been examined by this Court in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court observed that the issue at hand has not been dealt with and decided by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Narinderjit Singh Sahni (supra) as it was examining the issue whether a blanket order in the nature of anticipatory bail could be passed by this Court in exercise of its Writ Jurisdiction.
The crux of the grievance of the Petitioners in the said case was that although they had secured an order of bail in one case yet they were being detained in prison on the strength of a production warrant in another matter.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This Court held that an anticipatory bail application filed by an accused who is already in judicial custody in a different offence is maintainable under the scheme of the CrPC, and each such application will have to be decided by the competent courts on their own merits.
The High Court of Judicature at Bombay shall now proceed to decide the anticipatory bail application filed by the respondent accused on its own merits.
The appeal was dismissed, and pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.

The case involves a resolution plan for Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The Appellants, including DHFL's promoters Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan, and Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Limited (Piramal), filed appeals against the order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approving the resolution plan. The Appellants argued that the resolution plan was not approved in accordance with the IBC provisions.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the NCLT had failed to consider the objections raised by them regarding the resolution plan, and that the plan did not provide for a fair valuation of their shares. They also claimed that the Resolution Professional (RP) had not conducted a proper auction process, leading to an unfair outcome.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Appellants' objections were raised after the approval of the resolution plan and could not be considered as part of the original application. The court also noted that the RP had followed the due process in conducting the auction.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the NCLT's order approving the resolution plan was valid and in accordance with the IBC provisions. The court rejected the Appellants' appeals, stating that they were not entitled to object to the resolution plan after its approval. The court also clarified that the recovery of any amount from the Appellants would be decided separately under Section 66 of the IBC.

Additionally, the court directed the NCLT to decide on the Avoidance Applications filed by the Administrator and to pass orders in accordance with the powers conferred upon it under various sections of the IBC.

<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The complainant had filed a complaint in Chandigarh, but the petitioner argued that no part of the cause of action could be said to have arisen within Chandigarh. The petitioner also contended that despite the Court in Chandigarh having territorial jurisdiction, the proceedings deserved to be transferred to the Court in Delhi due to language barrier and convenience.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that no part of the cause of action could be said to have arisen within Chandigarh, and therefore, the complaint filed in Chandigarh was not maintainable. The petitioner also contended that even if the Court in Chandigarh had territorial jurisdiction, the proceedings deserved to be transferred to the Court in Delhi for the convenience of the accused.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the enactment of sub-section (2)(a) of Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and the Explanation thereto allows the complainant to file a complaint before the courts within whose jurisdiction the collection branch of the bank falls. The court noted that while the petitioner argued that no part of the cause of action could be said to have arisen within Chandigarh, it was not their case that the respondent Bank had no collection branch in Chandigarh.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that no case is made out for transfer of the proceedings under Section 406 CrPC. The court noted that mere inconvenience or hardship that the accused may have to face in traveling from Coimbatore to Chandigarh would not fall within the expression "expedient for the ends of justice". The court also observed that it was always open for the petitioner-accused to pray for exemption from personal appearance or request the Court that he may be permitted to join the proceedings online. Therefore, the petition fails and is hereby dismissed.

The case involves the imposition of service tax on sole distributors/purchasers of lottery tickets by the State Government. The respondents-assessees herein are these sole distributors/purchasers. They claimed that they do not come under the definition of "agent" or "service provider" and thus, no service tax is leviable on their transactions with the Government of Sikkim.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties include:

* The respondents-assessees herein argued that they are sole distributors/purchasers of lottery tickets, not agents or service providers. Therefore, no service tax is leviable on their transactions with the Government of Sikkim.
* The Union of India and others (appellants) argued that the amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, imposed service tax on the respondents-assessees herein as they were providing services as agents to the Government of Sikkim.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observed that:

* At each stage, the amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, in order to impose service tax on the sole distributor/purchasers of lottery tickets have been unsuccessful.
* The relationship between the State Government and the respondents-assessees herein is one of principal-to-principal, not principal-agent.
* There being no agency and no service rendered by the respondents-assessees herein as an agent to the Government of Sikkim, service tax is not leviable on the transactions between the purchaser of lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) and the Government of Sikkim.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

* The appeals filed by the Union of India and others are dismissed as they have no merit.
* The appeal filed by the assessee is disposed of accordingly.
* The parties are to bear their own costs.

This judgment is in line with the observations made by the court regarding the relationship between the State Government and the respondents-assessees herein, which is one of principal-to-principal. Therefore, service tax is not leviable on the transactions between the purchaser of lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) and the Government of Sikkim.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
This Court held that where extraneous conditions exist that might have led to the inability of the successful auction purchaser despite best efforts from depositing the balance amount to no fault of its own, in such cases the earnest-money deposited by such innocent successful auction purchaser could certainly be asked to be refunded.

Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, was arrested in connection with a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on August 22, 2022. He has been incarcerated for over 90 days and is seeking interim bail.
The PMLA case against Arvind Kejriwal is based on allegations of money laundering related to the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) election expenses during the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The court discussed whether "need and necessity to arrest" refers to formal parameters or personal grounds, and what parameters should be considered by the court while examining this question.
The court also discussed whether Arvind Kejriwal's right to life and liberty should be considered in granting interim bail, given his prolonged incarceration.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court noted that there is a discrepancy in the number of arrests made under the PMLA Act, with many individuals being arrested without sufficient evidence.
The court also observed that Arvind Kejriwal's role as the Chief Minister of Delhi and an elected leader should be taken into consideration while making decisions regarding his bail.

The case involves a dispute over forest land in India. The plaintiff, who could not prove his title, filed an application for denotification before the Government which was rejected. The Forest Settlement Officer concluded the proceedings under the A.P. Forest Act. The suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable as he has not challenged the proceedings under Section 15 of the A.P. Forest Act. The plaintiff could not prove his title, and there lies no relevance to the action taken under the A.P. Land Revenue Act, 1317 F.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the plaintiff's argument is that he has a right to the forest land, while the defendant's argument is likely to be that the proceedings under the A.P. Forest Act have concluded and the land has been declared as government land.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had earlier given a clear finding that even at the time of declaration under the A.P. Land Revenue Act, 1317 F, these lands were not shown as private lands by the defendant. The High Court showed utmost interest and benevolence in allowing the review by setting aside the well-merited judgment in the appeal by replacing its views in all material aspects.

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court of India allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment, and restored the judgement rendered in A.S. No. 145 of 1994.

For the Appellant:
The appellant's counsel argued that the decision was rendered in utmost haste and it would be humanly impossible to deliver such a long judgment within half an hour's time.

<FACTS>
The case pertains to the promotion of judicial officers to the Higher Judicial Service under Rule 5(1) of the 2005 Rules, which stipulates that promotions should be based on 'Merit-cum-Seniority'. The petitioners challenged the final Select List dated 10.03.2023, claiming that it was contrary to the principle of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' as they had scored higher marks in the suitability test but were not promoted.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the promotion process adopted by the High Court of Gujarat did not fulfill the twin requirements stipulated in paragraph 27 of All India Judges' Association (3) (supra), which are: 
(I) The objective assessment of legal knowledge of the judicial officer including adequate knowledge of case law and;
(II) Evaluation of the continued efficiency of the individual candidates.
They also argued that if their contention were to be accepted, it would completely obliterate the fine distinction between the two categories of promotion in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge by way of 65% promotion on the basis of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' and 10% promotion strictly on the basis of merit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the four components of the Suitability Test as prescribed under the recruitment notice dated 12.04.2022 comprehensively evaluate (i) the legal knowledge including knowledge of the case law through the objective MCQ-based written test AND (ii) the continued efficiency by evaluation of the ACRs, average disposal and past judgments of the concerned judicial officer.
The Court also noted that accepting the argument of the petitioners would completely flip the process and displace the respondents once again, for a contrary reason.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court clarified that this judgment shall not be construed to invalidate the promotions to the Higher Judicial Service granted by other High Courts based on a construction of their own rules and requirements of service in the state judiciary. The Court held that the impugned final Select List dated 10.03.2023 is not contrary to the principle of 'Merit-cum-Seniority' as stipulated in Rule 5(1)(I) of the 2005 Rules, and therefore dismissed the petition.

The appellants argued that the TDSAT erred in granting the spectrum without considering the technical requirements for its use. They also pointed out that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had not followed due process in recommending the grant of spectrum.

The respondents argued that the TDSAT was right in granting the spectrum as it was within the prescribed limits and did not violate any technical norms.
</ARGUMENTS>

It also noted that the TRAI had followed due process in recommending the grant of spectrum, but the TDSAT did not consider this fact when making its decision.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>

The case revolves around a poem allegedly promoting enmity between two groups, leading to the registration of an FIR (First Information Report) under Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court was approached to quash the FIR and subsequent proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented before the High Court emphasized the importance of freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees citizens the right to express their thoughts and views without fear of censorship or prosecution. The petitioners argued that the poem in question did not incite violence or hatred but rather expressed opinions and ideas that should be protected.
The respondents, on the other hand, contended that the poem was inflammatory and could potentially stir up animosity between different groups, thus falling under Section 153A of the IPC.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that while freedom of expression is a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a), it is not absolute. However, in this case, the Court found that the poem did not incite violence or hatred and thus did not fall within the scope of Section 153A.
The Court also noted that the police and executive have a duty to uphold and protect fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, including freedom of expression. If they fail to do so, it is the duty of the Courts to step in and protect these rights.

The appellants argued that the reference in Section 236(1) of the Code pertaining to Special Court as mentioned in Section 435 of the Companies Act, 2013 stood frozen as on the date of enactment of the Code. They contended that even if it was held that the reference in Section 236(1) of the Code is a 'legislation by reference' and not 'legislation by incorporation', still the offenses punishable under the Code having imprisonment of two years or more will have to be tried by a Special Court presided by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had erred in quashing the complaint only on the ground that it was filed before a Special Court presided by a Sessions Judge. It was noted that at the most, the learned single judge of the High Court could have directed the complaint to be withdrawn and presented before the appropriate court having jurisdiction.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned judgment and order dated 14th February 2022, passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court. It was held that the Special Court presided by a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge will have jurisdiction to try the complaint under the Code. The matter was remitted to the learned single judge of the High Court for considering the petition of the respondents afresh on merits.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves three appellants who were wrongly convicted and sentenced. The Public Prosecutor failed to present the complete picture of the case, suppressed evidence, and was partial towards the prosecution. The State Government is responsible for appointing the Public Prosecutor.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the defense counsel and the appellants' lawyers highlighted the irregularities in the trial process and the failure of the Public Prosecutor to discharge his duties fairly. They argued that the conviction was based on flawed evidence and that the accused were entitled to a fair trial.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the judges include:
* The sheer pressure of work can lead to mistakes, but the State Government is responsible for appointing competent Public Prosecutors.
* Judges are human beings and may commit errors, but it is the duty of defense counsel and Public Prosecutors to correct them.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
* The appeals succeed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is hereby set aside.
* The State Government shall pay Rs. 5,00,000/- each to the three appellants towards compensation within a period of four weeks from today, failing which appropriate action will be taken against the responsible officer.
* The bail bonds furnished by the appellants stand discharged.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around an appeal against the summoning order dated 21.02.2024 issued by the Trial Court. The appellants were summoned as accused in a criminal trial, and they had previously moved an application under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to be discharged from the case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the appellants argued against being summoned as accused after the conclusion of the trial, and the Trial Court's decision to summon them was challenged.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are as follows:

* The law expounded in Maru Ram (supra) and Krishnaji Dattatreya Bapat (supra) is relevant to this case, which states that an order passed by a higher court relating back to the original order of the Trial Court is binding on the Trial Court.
* The combined effect of the revisional order passed by the High Court and the summoning order passed by the Trial Court would be that the order of the Trial Court rejecting the second Section 319 application stood replaced and substituted by the summoning order dated 21.02.2024.
* A right of hearing would accrue only to a person who is already discharged in the very same proceeding prior to the commencement of the trial, not to a summoned person under Section 319 CrPC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:

* The appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.
* The Trial Court is directed to take necessary steps in furtherance of the summoning order dated 21.02.2024 to ensure that the appellants are produced before the court to face the trial.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the rejection of a compounding application by the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara. The appellant had applied for compounding under Section 276CC of the Income Tax Act, 1961, for the Assessment Year (AY) 2013-14. The offence alleged was that the appellant had failed to pay tax on time, which is considered a "first offence" as defined in the 2014 guidelines.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the rejection of their compounding application by the Chief Commissioner was incorrect and that they were eligible for compounding under the 2014 guidelines. The appellant relied on the definition of "first offence" in the 2014 guidelines, which states that an offence is considered a "first offence" if it is committed within three years from the end of the financial year in which the tax was payable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the appellant's compounding application could not have been rejected by Respondent no. 1 on the ground that it was a "second or subsequent offence", as defined under the 2014 guidelines. The court also noted that there has been a shift in policy by the Department regarding the compounding of offences under Section 276CC, with the Guidelines for Compounding of Offences under Direct Tax Laws, 2019 and 2022 making this offence compoundable up to three occasions.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside both the orders passed by the High Court and the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Vadodara. The appellant was directed to prefer a fresh application for compounding before the competent authority within two weeks from the date of this judgment. The same would be adjudicated by the competent authority having regard to the conduct of the appellant, the nature of the offence, and the facts and circumstances of the case within four weeks from the date on which the application is filed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves an appeal regarding the selection of appellants for a particular position. The appellants were selected in 1998 and have been holding office and performing their duties for over twenty-five years under interim orders. There is also an issue of bias against one of the appellants, which needs to be investigated.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The principle of audi alteram partem (hearing the other side) is essential in ensuring justice and fairness in decision-making. The court emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard, and this principle transforms justice from a mere technical formality into a humane pursuit.

A defect at the initial stage cannot generally be cured at the appellate stage, even if full jurisdiction is available. The courts must have discretion to relegate it to the original stage for an opportunity of hearing.

The procedural safeguards of a fair hearing are necessary to establish facts and prove allegations of bias.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Providing a hearing to affected individuals minimizes the risk of administrative authorities making decisions in ignorance of facts or other relevant circumstances. This process aids the administration in arriving at correct decisions and enables courts to review such actions more effectively.

The significance of natural justice lies in fostering fair and well-informed decision-making at the very first instance.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upholds the opinion of Justice KV Vishwanathan, allowing the appeal(s) and setting aside the judgment of the Division Bench. Since the selection pertains to the year 1998, and the appellants have continuously held office and performed their duties for over twenty-five years under interim orders, remanding the matter for a fresh inquiry would hardly be a practical exercise.

The court concludes that the ex-parte decision to set aside the appellants' selection stands vitiated. The parties are required to bear their own costs.

<FACTS>
The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was dissolved on the ground of irretrievable breakdown. The respondent-husband filed an application under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India, seeking dissolution of the marriage. The petitioners had also filed a complaint against the respondent-husband for various offenses, including sections 354, 376, 377, 420, 498A, 503, 506, and 509 of the IPC, as well as sections 66 and 67 of the IT Act, 2000. The petitioner was occupying premises belonging to the respondent's father at Pune and Bhopal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the respondent-husband's application under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India was likely based on the irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was dissolved on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
- The criminal cases filed against the respondent-husband, arising out of FIR No. 588 of 2022 dated 15.12.2022 before the Police Station Yerwada, District Pune, for offenses punishable under sections 354, 376, 377, 420, 498A, 503, 506, and 509 of the IPC and sections 66 and 67 of the IT Act, 2000, were quashed.
- The respondent shall pay the petitioner a sum of Rs. 12,00,00,000/- (Rupees Twelve Crores only) which shall be paid within a period of one month from today.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:
- The application filed by the respondent-husband under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India is allowed, and the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent is dissolved on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
- The criminal cases and consequential proceedings pending against the respondent-husband, arising out of FIR No. 588 of 2022 dated 15.12.2022 before the Police Station Yerwada, District Pune, for offenses punishable under sections 354, 376, 377, 420, 498A, 503, 506, and 509 of the IPC and sections 66 and 67 of the IT Act, 2000, are hereby quashed.
- The respondent shall pay the petitioner a sum of Rs. 12,00,00,000/- (Rupees Twelve Crores only) which shall be paid within a period of one month from today.

<FUNCTI> 
 Legal Assistant AI's task is to analyze the given case and extract key information from it in a structured and organized format.
 </FUNCTI>

<FACTS>
The document Ext.A1 was registered by Defendant No.1, which suggests that it was handed over to them. This registration is possible only if the document was delivered by Defendant No.2 (the executant). The conduct of the parties can be used to derive the factum of acceptance. The plaintiff was in possession of the original title deed when the suit was filed, and the stand of the defendants that the plaintiff took away the document later is unbelievable. Once a gift has been acted upon, it cannot be unilaterally cancelled.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The ratio in the judgments in Daulat Singh (Supra) and others were applied to the case. Delivery of possession is not a sine qua non for a valid gift or settlement. For a document to be valid, it is sufficient if it is proved that the same was acted upon during the life time of the executant. The plaintiff registered the instrument, which is possible only if the document was handed over by Defendant No.2 (the executant). The factum of acceptance can be derived from the conduct of the parties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The creation of a life interest with rights to enjoy the income from the property is a plausible and justifiable reason for the plaintiff not to reside in the premises. Defendant No.2 had no right to cancel the document unilaterally, and the Sub Registrar had no right to register the cancellation deed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court had erroneously concluded that Ext.A1 was a Will without appreciating the law. However, the High Court rightly set aside the concurrent judgments of the Courts below by treating the document as a "settlement". The appeal is dismissed, confirming the judgment passed by the High Court. The parties shall bear their own costs.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case revolves around a person accused of committing murder and sentenced to capital punishment. The matter was initially tried, but due to procedural irregularities and non-compliance with the principles of law, the trial court's conviction and the high court's confirmation thereof were set aside. The appeals were allowed, and the matters were remanded to the trial court for a fresh trial.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The prosecution and trial proceeded in a casual manner, with numerous adjournments due to the non-production of witnesses. This lackadaisical approach by the prosecution was criticized by the judges. The defense's arguments, if any, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The judges observed that even in cases involving heinous crimes, individuals have the right to basic protection under the law. They emphasized the importance of complying with the principles of law and procedural rigors. The judges also noted that due to non-compliance, all parties involved will have to undergo the trial process again.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeals were allowed, and the judgments of the trial court convicting the appellant and awarding capital punishment were set aside. The matters were remanded to the trial court for a fresh trial. The judges directed the registry to communicate this order to the registrar general of the high court and requested that the matter be heard and judgment delivered within one year.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The plaintiffs were owners of Final Plot No. 463 in the original Town Planning Scheme, which was admeasuring 3890 sq. yds. However, due to reconstitution of plots under a new scheme, they were allotted Final Plot No. 187, which was admeasuring 2724 sq. yds. The plaintiffs claimed compensation for the shortfall area of 974 sq. yds.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiffs argued that their main prayer in the suit was for quantified compensation based on the value of Final Plot No. 463, which could not be allotted to them. They also prayed for allotment of an extent of land equivalent to the shortfall area. However, they failed to produce any evidence to support the land values relevant to any point in time.
The plaintiffs relied on Section 52(3)(x) and Section 54 of the Town Planning Act, which provide for estimation of compensation by the Town Planning Officer and appellate review, respectively. However, they did not avail themselves of these remedies.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The value of Final Plot No. 463 in the original Town Planning Scheme was equated to an extent of 974 sq. yds. in any Town Planning Scheme in the western zone of Ahmedabad. However, no evidence was led as to the values of the two final plots.
There was no guarantee that a plot owner who surrendered his land pursuant to a Town Planning Scheme would be allotted any land after reconstitution of the plots.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court allowed the first appeal filed by the Corporation and non-suited the plaintiffs in entirety. The impugned judgment was upheld on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to produce evidence to support their claim for quantified damages, and there was no guarantee of allotment of land after reconstitution of plots.

<FACTS>
The case involves a list of petitions and cases categorized under Group E, which pertains to distinct facts and circumstances.

<OBSERVATIONS>
The categorization of cases under Group E suggests that these cases require special attention due to their unique facts and circumstances. The observation that these cases may overlap with Groups A to C but are intended exclusively for Group E implies that the courts have identified specific issues or patterns in these cases.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment directs that all cases falling under Group E shall be remanded back to the High Court, regardless of their classification within the aforementioned categories. This suggests that the court has decided to revisit and re-evaluate these cases with a fresh perspective.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The Chief Judicial Magistrate extended the period for completion of a preliminary assessment under Section 15 of the Act beyond three months, as provided in Section 14(3). 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The provision of Section 14(3) providing a three-month period for completing a preliminary assessment is directory and not mandatory.
- The Chief Judicial Magistrate has the power to extend the period for completion of the preliminary assessment beyond three months, provided reasons are recorded in writing.
- The words 'Children's Court' and 'Court of Sessions' can be read interchangeably under the Act, with jurisdiction primarily vesting in the Children's Court but vested in the Court of Sessions in the absence of a constituted Children's Court.
- Appeals against orders passed by the Board under Section 15 of the Act can be filed within 30 days, and the appellate court can entertain the appeal even after the expiry of this period if sufficient cause is shown.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- The importance of properly recording presence, adjournment purposes, and party representatives in orders passed by courts, tribunals, boards, and quasi-judicial authorities.
- The need for transparency in judicial proceedings to ensure accountability and facilitate decision-making.

The RPs were filed by various parties, including the Government of NCT of Delhi, the DDA, and individuals affected by the land acquisition.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the parties involved raised concerns about the DDA's land acquisition policies, including issues related to compensation, relocation, and due process.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a husband who is accused of murdering his wife. The prosecution's foundational facts include:
a) The offence took place inside the four walls of the house where the respondent-accused, the deceased, and their 7-year-old daughter were living.
b) The failure on the part of the accused to inform the family members about the death of their daughter and the clandestine manner in which her body was cremated.
c) The dubious conduct of the respondent-accused in fleeing away from home leaving behind his minor daughter of seven years age all alone.
d) The untimely death of the deceased in suspicious circumstances, occurring shortly after a fight with the respondent-accused two to three days before the incident, coupled with evidence of their strained relationship.
e) The respondent-accused maintained complete silence and failed to explain any of the incriminating circumstances pointing a finger against him.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The prosecution invokes Section 106 of the Evidence Act, which states that when a person is accused of causing the death of another person in circumstances where it can be inferred that he was responsible for such death, the burden shifts to the accused to explain what actually happened. The prosecution argues that the accused's behavior and actions provide sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against him.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The court observes that the accused's failure to inform the family about the death of their daughter, his dubious conduct in fleeing away from home, and his strained relationship with the deceased are all indicative of his guilt. The court also notes that the accused maintained complete silence and failed to explain any of the incriminating circumstances pointing a finger against him.
</Observations>

<Judgment>
The court allows the appeal, sets aside the impugned judgment and order of acquittal passed by the High Court, and restores the judgment and order of conviction passed by the Trial Court. The respondent-accused is directed to surrender before the Trial Court within a period of four weeks from today to undergo the sentence as imposed by the Trial Court.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed by the appellants against the respondent under the Factories Act, 1948. The respondent is a laundry service provider and the issue at hand is whether the respondent's activities constitute a "manufacturing process" as defined under the Factories Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The appellants contend that the respondent's activities involve washing, cleaning, and treatment of clothes, which falls within the definition of a "manufacturing process".
- The respondents argue that their activities do not constitute a "manufacturing process" as they are merely providing laundry services.
- The court also considered the registration of the respondent as a factory under the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Act and the definition of "manufacturing process" under Section 2(k) of the Factories Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The court notes that the respondent is registered as a factory under the ESIC Act for the same premises, but it has not relied solely on this fact in its decision.
- The court also observed that the order issuing process was cryptic and did not reflect any application of mind.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:
- The court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court, effectively reinstating the complaint filed against the respondent.
- The court held that the respondent's activities constitute a "manufacturing process" under the Factories Act, and therefore, they are liable to be proceeded with in accordance with law.
- The case was remitted back to the Magistrate for further proceedings.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent, a high-performing employee, submitted his resignation to the appellant company due to unfair rating and lack of feedback. He made a complaint to the Ombudsman regarding his unfair rating.
He claimed that he was forced to resign, citing "humiliation and insult" in his resignation letter.
Over six months preceding his resignation, the respondent felt subjected to unfair rating, leading to his disillusionment and dissatisfaction with working for the company.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent argued that he was a "workman" under the Industrial Disputes Act (ID Act) due to his high-performance nature and quality of work.
He claimed that his resignation was forced upon him by the company, which led to a reference being made to the Labour Court under the ID Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the respondent's language in his resignation letter did not necessarily indicate that he was coerced into resigning.
The court noted that the respondent had channels of venting his grievances, but he chose to resign instead of pursuing those options.
The court also pointed out that it would be "far-fetched" for the entire organization to turn against one individual, and that the respondent's resignation seemed more like a result of being unfairly rated rather than any arbitrariness or high-handedness on part of the company.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the respondent was not a "workman" under the ID Act and therefore, the reference to the Labour Court was not maintainable.
The impugned judgment and the judgment rendered by the learned Single Judge were set aside, and the judgment of the Labour Court was revived and restored.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the acquisition of a property by the appellant-Corporation under Section 352 of the Act. The Corporation passed an order of acquisition on January 18, 1991, directing to acquire the subject land with immediate effect and the possession should also be taken immediately. However, it is seen from the notes that the possession was taken in March 1991. Despite the noting that possession can only be taken after the payment of compensation under Section 363(3) of the Act, no compensation has been paid as yet.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the Corporation argued that they acquired the property lawfully under Section 352 of the Act, while the respondent(s) contended that the acquisition was per se illegal and invalid as it contravened the provisions of the Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court found that the Corporation acted blatantly in violation of statutory provisions in acquiring the property. The Court observed that the entire action concerning the acquisition of property by invoking Section 352(a) of the Act is per se illegal, invalid and in clear contravention to the provisions of the Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court allowed the writ petition and rejected the case of the appellant-Corporation acquiring land under Section 352 of the Act. The impugned judgment does not brook interference on any count. The appeal filed by the Corporation against the judgment of the High Court was dismissed with costs quantified at Rs. 5,00,000/- to be paid to respondent no. 1 within a period of sixty days from the date of the order.

The case involves a challenge to various provisions of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of the respective States. The petitioners are seeking to assail the said provisions, which pertain to the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959, the Puducherry Act of 1972, and the Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Act, 1987.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners have challenged various provisions of the respective Acts, including those related to the assessment of contributions on trustees, the common good fund, and the power of Deputy Commissioners to decide certain disputes and matters. The petitioners argue that these provisions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court notes that the scheme of the respective Scheme Acts may be distinct, and therefore, it would be more effective for the petitioners to assail the provisions of the respective Acts before the respective jurisdictional High Courts. The Court also observes that if writ petitions are filed by the petitioners before the respective High Courts, they could be considered having regard to the various dimensions of the provisions in light of socio-economic, cultural, and religious aspects.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court disposes of the writ petitions by reserving liberty to the petitioners to file their writ petitions before the respective High Courts. The Court also notes that the High Courts are free to constitute an Expert Committee to have assistance of the recommendations said Committee for the purpose of deciding the cases, if they so think fit.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the appeals filed against the order passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) regarding the insolvency proceedings of a corporate debtor. The Resolution Professional had submitted a resolution plan, which was approved by the NCLT but rejected by the NCLAT. The appeals were filed challenging the NCLAT's order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Court observed that the NCLAT's order was perverse and unsustainable in law. It noted that there was no progress in implementing the resolution plan, which had been approved almost five years ago. The Court highlighted several issues with the functioning of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the NCLAT, including:
- A shortage of members in the Tribunals
- Inadequate infrastructure to support their functioning
- Vacancies leading to operational inefficiencies
- Failure to comply with strict timelines provided in Section 12 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
The Court suggested that the Parliament should look into these issues in consultation with the Insolvency Bankruptcy Board of India and the Ministry of Finance.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that there was a lack of progress in implementing the resolution plan, which had been approved almost five years ago. It noted that the NCLAT's order had led to further complications, and the appeals were allowed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court directed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai to take appropriate steps for the appointment of a liquidator and all other necessary formalities for the commencement of liquidation of the corporate debtor. The amount of Rs 200 Crore already infused by the Successful Resolution Applicant (SRA) stands forfeited, and the lenders/creditors are permitted to encash the Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs. 150 Crore furnished by the SRA.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of the High Court in a matter related to the arrest and bail of the appellant. The First Information Report (FIR) was lodged at the Elamakkara Police Station, and the appellant was subsequently arrested.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant's counsel emphasized the need for strict construction of penal statutes, as per the principles laid down in various legal precedents. The counsel argued that the power to punish is vested in the legislature, not the judicial department, and therefore, the court should adopt a narrow interpretation to avoid imposing penalties unless the language of the statute is clear and distinct.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the judges highlight the importance of strict construction of penal statutes. They noted that such construction manifests itself in four ways: (1) requiring express language for creating an offence, (2) interpreting strictly words setting out the elements of an offence, (3) requiring fulfillment to the letter of statutory conditions precedent to inflicting punishment, and (4) insisting on strict observance of technical provisions concerning criminal procedure and jurisdiction.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court. The judges directed that in the event of arrest, the appellant should be released on bail subject to terms and conditions imposed by the Investigating Officer. The pending applications, if any, were disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves the allotment of land at the basic rate to certain categories of persons, including MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS/State Government, Judges of the Constitutional Courts, and journalists. The government had issued orders (GoM Nos. 243 and 244) classifying these individuals as a separate class for allotment of land at the basic rate. The applicants challenged this decision in the High Court, which was allowed.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The applicants argued that the classification made by the government was arbitrary and did not have a rational nexus to the policy of allotting land at the basic rate. They contended that the decision was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of status or position.
</Arguments>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the classification made by the government was based on the status or position of the individuals and not on any rational principle. The court noted that many other categories of persons who were equally deserving of consideration had been excluded from the benefits of allotment at the basic rate. The court also noted that some members of the society continued to defend the allotment, presenting arguments that they constituted a separate class with a rational nexus to the policy.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the classification made by the government was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The court quashed GoM Nos. 243 and 244 dated 28.02.2005, which classified MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS/State Government, Judges of the Constitutional Courts, and journalists as a separate class for allotment of land at the basic rate. The court also declared GoM Nos. 419, 420, 422 to 425 dated 25.03.2008, and GoM No. 551 dated 27.03.2008, which were based on the same classification, as bad in law. The court allowed the appeal preferred by Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav challenging the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a tender issued in favor of the appellant for erecting structures on underpasses to display advertisements. The respondent cancelled the tender at the behest of the Minister-In-Charge, and the appellant had made significant investments pursuant to the tender.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the court include:
* The notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 was illegal and arbitrary.
* The State has no power to alter or cancel a contract that it has entered into, unless such considerations are bona-fide and earnestly reflected in the decision-making process.
* Participating and winning a tender should not be viewed as a situation worse than losing one at the threshold.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed:
* The cancellation of the tender was an arbitrary exercise of powers by the respondent, which had a chilling effect on public participation in the tendering process.
* Arbitrary terminations of contracts create uncertainty and unpredictability, thereby discouraging public participation in public-private partnership ventures.
* The State should be circumspect in disturbing or wriggling out of its contractual obligations through means beyond the terms of the contract in exercise of their executive powers.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held:
* The notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023 is quashed and set aside.
* The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is hereby set aside.
* The appeal succeeds, and pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the management and protection of Tiger Reserves in India. A High Court of Uttarakhand had passed a judgment on September 6, 2023 (Writ Petition No.178 of 2021) directing the CBI to investigate the matter. The current case is an appeal or follow-up action taken by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court notes that there was a massive destruction and degradation of forest areas in the state of Uttarakhand due to human activities, leading to a severe impact on biodiversity. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
None are explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the arguments were focused around:
- The need for effective management and protection of Tiger Reserves
- The responsibility of government authorities in maintaining environmental standards
- The importance of preserving biodiversity and ecosystems
- Possibly, some arguments regarding the High Court's order and its implementation by the CBI
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court include:
- The importance of preserving Tiger Reserves and their ecosystem for future generations
- The need for a comprehensive approach to protect these areas from human activities that harm biodiversity
- Appreciation for the efforts of the learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. K. Parameshwar, in assisting the court with valuable research and formulations
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court's judgment includes:
- Directing the CBI to investigate the matter as per the High Court's order (Writ Petition No.178 of 2021)
- Directing the Committee formed for recommendations on Tiger Reserves to submit a preliminary report within three months
- Requesting the Committee to consider factors such as eco-tourism, noise restrictions, and types of resorts permitted near protected areas when making their recommendations

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellant and respondent no. 6-ARCIL regarding the suit property. The appellant has set up an oxygen cylinder manufacturing plant on the suit property, which has been running for almost 15 years with approximately 200 employees working there. The respondent no. 6-ARCIL claims that it is entitled to take possession of the suit property as per the mortgage deed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by both parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the appellant's main argument would be that it has invested a huge amount in setting up the plant and has been running it for 15 years, and therefore, taking possession of the property would cause immense difficulties to the appellant. The respondent no. 6-ARCIL's main argument would likely be that it is entitled to take possession of the property as per the mortgage deed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court has already passed an order in favor of respondent no. 6-ARCIL, but the facts and circumstances of this case have left the judges with an uphill task to mould the final order necessary to do substantial justice to the parties involved.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Both appeals are allowed in part. The High Court's judgment is affirmed, and the appellant is directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees Four Crore Only) with respondent no. 6-ARCIL within six months from today. If the appellant fails to do so, the competent authorities will take over the possession of the entire unit with the land in question and put it once again for sale by way of fresh auction process.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a dispute over the chargeable distance from Refinery Baad to Hisar, with the respondent claiming that the correct distance is 333.18 km instead of the initially charged 444 km. The Railways reworked the chargeable distance and granted a refund to the applicant company without explaining the reason.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The Appellant's arguments were not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it can be inferred that they claimed the chargeable distance of 444 km was correct and that the respondent is not entitled to any refund. However, this is based on inference and may not accurately represent their actual arguments.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the courts were as follows:

- The Railway Claims Tribunal noted that the payment was made for 444 Kms instead of the actual distance of 333.18 Kms.
- Both the Railway Claims Tribunal and the High Court concurrently found that the actual distance from Baad to Hisar is 333.18 km.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the chargeable distance of 444 km was illegal for several reasons:

(i) The effect of the change in methodology on the chargeable distance would not have resulted in a huge difference of 110 km.

(ii) There had been neither any change in the route by way of addition of new stations nor change in the physical track length of the said route.

(iii) The letter dated 05.07.2005 itself indicates that the change in the chargeable distance of 444 km was due to an error, and has no bearing with the Ministry of Railway's letter dated 07.04.2004 introducing the new methodology.

(iv) The factum of the appellants themselves granting refund without explaining the reason for the same, despite their stance that the respondent is not entitled to any refund.

(v) The failure of the appellant in establishing that the chargeable distance of 444 km was the correct chargeable distance as per the law.

(vi) Concurrent findings of both, the Railway Claims Tribunal and the High Court on the limited aspect of the actual distance being 333.18 km.

The appeals filed by the Appellant railway were dismissed.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant and claimant have different interpretations of the arbitration agreement and its scope.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement as contained in Clause 13 of the insurance policy.
- The dispute regarding "accord and satisfaction" can be adjudicated upon by the arbitral tribunal as a preliminary issue.
- The date of commencement of the limitation period for determining whether Section 11(6) application has been filed within the period of limitation of three years or not shall have to be construed as per the decision in Arif Azim (supra).

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the appointments of certain individuals to government positions. The appellants were appointed as Block Development Officers (BDOs) in 1998, but their appointments were challenged by Respondent No.4, Archana Mishra, who filed a complaint with the Collector.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that their appointments were valid and that they had functioned in office for over 25 years without any issues. They also pointed out that the Collector failed to provide them with an opportunity to be heard before cancelling their appointments.
The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the appellants' appointments were invalid due to various procedural irregularities. Respondent No.4 claimed that she had been unfairly denied a position as BDO and sought a fresh inquiry into the matter.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Collector failed to provide the appellants with an opportunity to be heard before cancelling their appointments, which was in violation of Rule 9 of the A&R Rules. The court also noted that the respondents had not impleaded the selected candidates before the Collector, as required by law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court. The court held that the appellants' appointments were valid and that they were entitled to continue in service. The court also ordered that their appointments be deemed valid from 1998, entitling them to all service benefits.
However, due to a request for constitution of a larger bench by some of the judges, the Registry was directed to place the matter before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for further action.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two appellants who were accused of causing the death of a person. The deceased was attacked by the appellants with deadly weapons, resulting in serious injuries that led to his death on the third day after the incident.
The sole eyewitness, Lata Bai (PW-10), the mother of the deceased, testified that her son had visiting terms with the accused persons and could not explain why a quarrel suddenly occurred between them.
The appellants were armed with deadly weapons during the assault, and it was established beyond reasonable doubt that they caused the death of the deceased fully knowing that the bodily injuries they inflicted would likely cause death.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the appellants committed murder under Section 302 IPC, which carries a punishment of imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term that may extend to ten years and a fine.
However, the defense counsel contended that the appellants' actions did not amount to premeditated murder but rather constituted culpable homicide under Part I of Section 304 IPC, which carries a punishment of imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term that may extend to ten years and a fine.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the motive behind the assault was not clearly established, and it appeared that the appellants did not intend to kill the deceased but rather inflicted serious injuries with the knowledge that they would likely cause death.
The court also noted that the deceased survived for three days after the incident before succumbing to his injuries, which suggested that the cumulative effect of the head injuries led to his demise.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately convicted the appellants under Part I of Section 304 IPC (Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder) and sentenced them to imprisonment for the period already undergone by them, with an additional fine of Rs.50,000 each payable to the family of the deceased.
If the appellants fail to pay the fine within a specified timeframe, they will undergo six months' simple imprisonment in default.
The court's order dated January 9, 2025, partially allowed the appeal and imposed the specified sentence on the appellants.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute related to the acquisition of land for public purposes, specifically the construction of a highway. The Division Bench of the High Court set aside a well-reasoned judgment rendered by a learned Single Judge, which allowed the acquisition of land.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the constitutional protection against compulsory acquisitions is not limited to fair compensation but also encompasses other rights and interests in property. They contended that the High Court's Division Bench erred in interfering with the Single Judge's judgment.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the Division Bench committed an egregious error by interfering with the well-reasoned judgment of the Single Judge. The court emphasized that constitutional protection for compulsory acquisitions extends beyond fair compensation to include other rights and interests in property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Both appeals were allowed, and the impugned judgment passed by the Division Bench was set aside. The judgment of the learned Single Judge was affirmed and restored.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal appeal where the accused is charged with offenses related to the death of a person named EA. The prosecution's case relies on circumstantial evidence, including the recovery of a trolley bag from a witness named PW-24 and the discovery of an ID card belonging to the deceased in the possession of the accused's sister.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argues that the circumstantial evidence establishes the guilt of the accused. The defense, however, points out several infirmities in the prosecution's case, including the lack of a direct link between the accused and the crimes, the unreliability of witness PW-5, and the unexplained presence of the ID card in the accused's sister's possession.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the prosecution has not established its case beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstantial evidence is found to be sketchy and disjointed, and does not form a complete chain of events leading to the guilt of the accused. The court also notes that the accused's actions in retaining the ID card for over two months are unexplained.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allows the appeal and sets aside the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 20.12.2018. The accused is acquitted of the offenses for which he was charged, and is set free forthwith if not required in any other case.

<FACTS>
The case involves the State of Telangana, various Cooperative Societies, and their members. The issue revolves around the allotment of land to MPs, MLAs, officers of the AIS/State Government, Judges of the Constitutional Courts, and journalists at a basic rate. The matter started with Writ Petition Nos. 7956, 7997, and 23862 of 2008 filed by various individuals challenging the Government Orders (GoMs) issued by the State of Telangana.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Cooperative Societies and their members argued that they constituted a separate class with a rational nexus to the policy. However, these arguments were deemed devoid of merit and rejected by the court. Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav challenged the judgment passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, which allowed his appeal and quashed the GoMs.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the allotment of land to a specific class at a basic rate was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court noted that many individuals, including MPs, MLAs, officers, Judges, and journalists, had been allotted land without any rational basis or nexus to the policy. The court also observed that some individuals who were aware of the constitutional limitations had voluntarily relinquished their claims for allotment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Division Bench allowed Mr. Keshav Rao Jadhav's appeal, quashed GoMs Nos. 243 and 244 dated 28.02.2005, and declared that GoM Nos. 419, 420, 422 to 425 dated 25.03.2008, and GoM No. 551 dated 27.03.2008, were bad in law due to their violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court also directed the State of Telangana to refund the entire amount deposited by the Cooperative Societies and their members, including stamp duty, registration fee, and interest.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a husband who is accused of murdering his wife. The offense took place inside their home, and the husband has not disputed his presence at the time of the alleged incident. The deceased's body was fully burnt by the time the Investigating Officer reached the scene. The husband fled away from home, leaving behind his minor daughter of seven years age. There is evidence of a strained relationship between the couple.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the circumstances constitute more than a prima facie case to enable the prosecution to invoke Section 106 of the Evidence Act and shift the burden on the accused husband to explain what had actually happened on the day his wife died. The court considered the following foundational facts: 
a) The offense took place inside the four walls of the house in which the respondent-accused, the deceased, and their seven-year-old daughter were living.
b) The failure on the part of the accused to inform the family members about the death of their daughter and the clandestine manner in which her body was cremated.
c) The dubious conduct of the respondent-accused in fleeing away from home leaving behind his minor daughter of seven years age all alone.
d) The untimely death of the deceased in suspicious circumstances, occurring shortly after a fight with the respondent-accused two to three days before the incident.
e) The respondent-accused maintained complete silence and failed to explain any of the incriminating circumstances pointing a finger against him.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the aforementioned circumstances constitute more than a prima facie case to enable the prosecution to invoke Section 106 of the Evidence Act. The court also noted that the respondent-accused's conduct was dubious, and he failed to explain any of the incriminating circumstances pointing towards him.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed, and the impugned judgment and order of acquittal passed by the High Court were set aside. The judgment and order of conviction passed by the Trial Court in S.T. No. 197 of 2003 stood restored. The respondent-accused was directed to surrender before the Trial Court within a period of four weeks from today to undergo the sentence as imposed by the Trial Court.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the application of Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and its implications on a summoned person. The facts suggest that an individual had been summoned as an accused under Section 319 CrPC but their application was initially rejected by the Trial Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the summoning order dated 21.02.2024, passed after the conclusion of the trial, should not have any bearing on the consideration of the application under Section 319. They contended that the revisional order passed by the High Court related back to the original order of the Trial Court and therefore, the Trial Court was not functus officio for the purpose of considering the application.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the summoning order dated 21.02.2024 was an extension of the revisional order passed by the High Court and that it should be construed as if it were passed on 19.07.2010, the original date of the order rejecting the application.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that Section 319 CrPC does not contemplate a right of hearing for a summoned person before being added as an accused to face trial. However, after the rejection of an application under Section 319, a right enures in favour of the proposed accused. If the High Court passes an order prejudicial to this benefit, it is obligated to provide an opportunity of hearing to the proposed accused.

The case revolves around a dispute regarding the institution of a second suit by the respondent no. 1 (original plaintiff) for claiming relief of specific performance of an agreement for sale dated 24.01.2007 and cancellation of the sale deed dated 24.01.2008.
The High Court had initially dismissed the plaint in the second suit, holding that it was barred under Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).
However, the respondent no. 1 challenged this decision, arguing that the bar under Order II Rule 2 did not apply to their case.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent no. 1 argued that the second suit was not barred by Order II Rule 2 because the cause of action for the subsequent suit was distinct from that of the first suit.
They also relied on the High Court's own decisions dated 05.03.2008 and 25.03.2008, which had set aside the ban imposed by a Government Order (G.O.) dated 08.08.1986 and directed the registrar to register the sale deeds pertaining to the suit property.
The respondent no. 1 contended that these decisions acted as a linchpin in saving the second suit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court could be said to have fallen into error by failing to notice the significance of its own decisions dated 05.03.2008 and 25.03.2008 in saving the second suit.
The respondent no. 1's counsel had argued that these decisions were crucial in determining whether the bar under Order II Rule 2 applied to their case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the bar under Order II Rule 2 of the CPC would not stand in the way of the institution of the second suit by the respondent no. 1 (original plaintiff).
It was made clear that this judgment did not express any views on the merits of the matter.
The appeals were dismissed, and pending applications stood disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent unconditionally withdrew the first Arbitration Petition. The respondent then filed a fresh application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996. The High Court allowed the said application, and the appeal was filed against this order.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case were:
- The respondent's right to file a fresh application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, after unconditionally withdrawing the first Arbitration Petition.
- The applicability of Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act and its effect on the fresh application filed by the respondent.
- The benefit of condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to the respondent's fresh application.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case were:
- That instances abound where observations of the court reserving liberty to a litigant have been misused by litigants to pursue remedies which were wholly barred by time or to revive stale claims.
- The distinction between liberties (or privileges) and corresponding duties on others, as per Hohfeld's analysis of jural relations.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed in the case was:
- That the fresh application filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, was not maintainable in the absence of any liberty being granted at the time of withdrawal of the first application.
- That the fresh application filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996, was time-barred.
- That the respondent is not entitled to the benefit of Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act.
- That the respondent is also not entitled to the benefit of condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.

The appeal filed by the appellant was allowed, and the impugned order passed by the High Court was hereby set aside. The parties were directed to bear their own costs.

<WITNESS STATEMENT></WITNESS STATEMENT>

<FACTS>
The case deals with the validity of certain clauses in the Bihar Rules, 1951 and Gujarat Rules, 2005 related to the selection process for District Judge positions. The petitioners challenged the minimum qualifying marks for interview as prescribed by these rules.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioners argued that the prescription of minimum qualifying marks for interview is not in line with the recommendations of the Shetty Commission, which was accepted by the All India Judges (2002) case. They also contended that the non-consultation with the Public Service Commission would render the Gujarat Rules, 2005 void.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the selection process in Bihar and Gujarat has been meandering, taking a long time to complete. It noted that there have been issues of non-availability of adequate candidates for consideration in the interview segment. The court also mentioned that the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy's report highlighted concerns such as the absence of a designated authority for candidates to approach with queries.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court upheld the impugned selection process in both states, holding that prescribing minimum qualifying marks for interview is permissible. It dismissed the writ petitions without ordering any costs. The court also directed that moderation of marks should be permitted when necessary and that the designation of members in the interview panel should be provided in the rules.

<FACTS>
The case involves the management and protection of Tiger Reserves in India. The High Court of Uttarakhand had directed an investigation into the matter, which was being monitored by this court. The Court noted that there was a need for effective management and protection of Tiger Reserves across the country.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Court considered various factors while framing its judgment, including:
* Effective management and protection of Tiger Reserves
* Promoting eco-tourism in buffer zones and fringe areas
* Restricting noise levels within a certain radius from protected forests
* Prohibiting activities that harm the ecosystem
* Imposing restrictions on resorts near protected areas
* Implementing measures for effective management and protection of Tiger Reserves across India

The Court also considered the report submitted by the CBI in relation to the investigation into the matter.
</ARGUMENTS>

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The complainant filed a private complaint against the appellants for cheating and criminal breach of trust. The Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate took cognizance upon the complaint. However, it was found that the complainant had not filed any civil suit for recovery of the amount which he claimed was due and payable to him by the appellants.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in the case is that the court below erred in taking cognizance upon the complaint. The arguments are based on the understanding that cheating and criminal breach of trust are independent offenses, and that the complainant should have filed a civil suit for recovery of the amount instead of filing a private complaint.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed by the court that even after 162 years since the Indian Penal Code (IPC) came into force in India, courts below have not been able to understand the fine distinction between criminal breach of trust and cheating. The court also noted that police officers often routinely and mechanically proceed to register an FIR for both offenses without proper application of mind.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal was allowed by the Supreme Court. The impugned order passed by the High Court and the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate were set aside. It was held that the continuation of the criminal proceeding would be an abuse of the process of law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the taxation of broken period interest on securities held by banks. The facts are related to various cases where different High Courts and Tribunals have made different rulings on whether the broken period interest should be considered as capital expenditure or revenue expenditure.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments in this case pertain to whether the broken period interest is a revenue expenditure or capital expenditure. The banks argue that the broken period interest is a revenue expenditure and should be allowed as a deduction, while the Revenue argues that it is a capital expenditure and should not be allowed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Tribunal had passed judgments in favor of the banks, allowing them to deduct the broken period interest. However, some High Courts and Tribunals have made different rulings on this issue.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court ultimately set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and restored the decisions of the Tribunal in favor of the banks. All other appeals preferred by the Revenue were dismissed subject to clarification regarding securities of the HTM category.

Order:

* Civil Appeal Nos.3291 to 3294 of 2009 are hereby allowed by setting aside the impugned judgment.
* The judgments dated 29th May 2003 and 15th July 2004 of the Appellate Tribunal are restored.
* All other Civil Appeals are dismissed.
* There will be no order as to costs.

The Supreme Court observed that the outlay on the purchase of securities was not a capital outlay, but rather an expenditure incurred in the normal course of business. Therefore, the broken period interest should be allowed as a revenue expenditure and deducted from taxable income.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals related to the payment of royalty by respondents (appellants) to the Bihar State Electricity Board. The respondents had challenged the demand for royalty and dead rent in relation to their power generation business. The main issue was whether the payments made by the respondents constituted a tax or royalty.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties were not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the respondents argued against paying the demanded royalty and dead rent, claiming that these amounts were excessive. The Bihar State Electricity Board, on the other hand, likely argued that the payments were legitimate and necessary.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that there are significant conceptual differences between royalty and tax. Royalty is a contractual consideration paid by the mining lessee to the lessor for enjoyment of mineral rights. In contrast, a tax is an imposition of the sovereign. The Court also noted that royalty generally flows from the lease deed as compared to tax, which is imposed by authority of law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that both royalty and dead rent do not fulfill the characteristics of tax or impost. It was observed that the payments made by the respondents constituted a contractual consideration for parting with the right to win minerals. The liability to pay royalty arose out of the contractual conditions of the mining lease, and the payments could not be deemed to be a tax merely because the statute provided for their recovery as arrears.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that despite the establishment of several schemes and frameworks, there is a huge gap between the number of persons identified for release by the Undertrial Review Committee (UTRC) and those actually released.

The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant's counsel argued that the recall petitions were not review petitions in disguise and should have been entertained.

The order directed that the petitioners should be released on bail in case of arrest. However, despite this direction, the police officials and the judicial magistrate granted police custody remand to the petitioners, which led to their detention for almost 48 hours after the period of police remand had come to an end.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments were presented by the respondents attempting to justify their actions. However, these arguments were not accepted by the court, which found that the respondents had acted with bias and in a high-handed manner.
The 6th Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (ACJM) argued that she was acting under a genuine misunderstanding of the legal position and based on settled practice in the State of Gujarat. However, this argument was rejected by the court, which held that her actions were in disregard to the order passed by the Supreme Court.

The representation made by the detenu in response to the detention order was received by the Prison Authorities on November 28, 2023. However, due to a casual and callous approach by the Prison Authorities, the representation could not reach the Detaining Authority and the Central Government within a reasonable period.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The detenu's right under Article 22(5) of the Constitution was violated due to the delay in deciding his representation. The Prison Authorities failed to send the representation to the Competent Authorities immediately after its receipt, resulting in a delay of almost 9 months in deciding the representation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that each day's delay matters in cases pertaining to personal liberty. The Prison Authorities could have sent the representation through email or Speed Post with acknowledgment due, ensuring that it reached the Competent Authorities within a reasonable period. However, due to their casual and callous approach, the representation was delayed.

The case involves the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The appellant deposited an amount of Rs. 7.5 crores on 22.10.2010, which was later increased to Rs. 8 crores after adding interest. A second deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs was made pursuant to a High Court order dated 03.06.2011. The proceedings against the award were finally decided on 01.07.2014.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in this case pertain to the conversion of foreign currency awards and interest under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The key points are:
* The statutory scheme of the Act makes a foreign arbitral award enforceable when objections against it are finally decided.
* When an amount is deposited before the court during the pendency of objections, this amount must be converted as on the date of deposit.
* After conversion, the deposited amount should be adjusted against the remaining principal and interest pending under the arbitral award. The remaining amount should then be converted on the date when the arbitral award becomes enforceable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* When the award debtor deposits an amount before the court during the pendency of objections, this deposited amount must be converted as on the date of deposit.
* The exchange rate for the second deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs should be determined based on the completion of proceedings, which in this case was 01.07.2014.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court concluded that:
* The first deposit of Rs. 7.5 crores must be converted as on the date of deposit being 22.10.2010.
* The second deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs, as well as the remaining amount due under the award, must be converted when the objections proceedings attained finality on 01.07.2014.
* The Executing Court should determine the amount payable by taking into account the exchange rate as on 01.07.2014.

The Khalsa University was established in 2016, and the appellants were the promoters of this university. The Khalsa College, a heritage institution established in 1892, had been a part of the Khalsa University. However, the appellants gave an undertaking that the Khalsa College would not be touched or adversely affected by the establishment of the Khalsa University. Additionally, it was stated during the hearing that the Khalsa College would not be affiliated with the Khalsa University.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in this case revolves around the concept of manifest arbitrariness as a ground for challenging the constitutionality of a legislation under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. The appellants contended that the impugned act, which aimed to repeal the Khalsa University Act, 2016 and restore the status quo as it existed on May 29, 2017, was violative of Article 14 due to its arbitrariness.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the purpose for enacting the impugned act was non-existent. The establishment of the Khalsa University did not pose any threat to the heritage status or the character of the Khalsa College, as all other institutions were separate from the original building. 
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the impugned act was violative of Article 14 due to its arbitrariness and manifest lack of reasonable classification between the old and new colleges. The court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the impugned judgment and order, and struck down the Khalsa University (Repeal) Act, 2017 as being unconstitutional. The consequent direction was issued that the Khalsa University Act, 2016 would be deemed to be in force, and status quo as it obtained on May 29, 2017, would stand restored.

The case involves multiple writ petitions and civil appeals related to the grant of Floor Space Index (FSI) and Transferable Development Rights (TDR) to landowners in Mumbai. The appellants, who are landowners, had constructed various amenities on their plots but did not request or represent for additional FSI/TDR under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1964.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that they were entitled to compensation in the form of FSI/TDR as per the law, and that there was no requirement for them to make a representation or request for additional FSI/TDR. They also contended that the doctrine of delay and laches did not apply in this case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the decisions of this Court where the question of delay and laches would not arise in matters such as the present cases were relevant. The Court noted that when relief in the nature of compensation is sought, once the compensation is determined in the form of FSI/TDR, it is payable even in the absence of a representation or request being made.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the Bombay High Court was not right in dismissing the writ petitions on the ground of delay and laches. It set aside those portions of the impugned order of the High Court and directed the respondent-Mumbai Municipal Corporation to consider the case of the writ petitioners/appellants in light of the judgments of this Court in Godrej & Boyce I and release the balance FSI/TDR to the appellants.

The case involves a resolution applicant (appellant) who paid Rs.38.87 crores to the financial creditor (1st respondent) on behalf of ACIL, the corporate guarantor, in the CIRP process. The assets of the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor were not part of the resolution plan approved for ACIL.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments made by the parties include:

* The appellant's contention that the payment of Rs.38.87 crores to the financial creditor extinguishes the liability of the 2nd respondent-principal borrower/corporate debtor to pay the entire amount payable under the loan transaction.
* The argument based on Section 140 of the Contract Act regarding subrogation and its implications on the rights of the financial creditor.
* The submission that by admitting an application under Section 7 of the IBC against the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor, valuable assets of ACIL have been taken away.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:

* The payment of Rs.38.87 crores to the financial creditor does not extinguish the liability of the 2nd respondent-principal borrower/corporate debtor.
* A holding company is not the owner of the assets of its subsidiary, and therefore, the assets of subsidiaries cannot be included in the resolution plan of the holding company.
* The financial creditor can file separate applications under Section 7 of the IBC against the corporate debtor and the corporate guarantor, which can be done simultaneously.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:

* The view taken by NCLAT is upheld, and the appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.

Additionally, the court clarifies that subrogation will only confer on the guarantor or the resolution applicant the right to recover only the amount mentioned above from the corporate debtor.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the appellant bank and the respondent regarding the sale of a secured asset. The respondent had won the e-auction for the asset but failed to make the balance payment, leading to the invocation of Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act. The respondent claimed that he was unable to make the balance payment due to demonetization and lack of documents from the bank.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but based on the context, it can be inferred that:
- The appellant bank argued that the respondent had knowingly participated in the e-auction and was aware of the consequences of failing to make the balance payment.
- The respondent claimed that he was unable to make the balance payment due to demonetization and lack of documents from the bank.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- Demonetization had occurred much before the e-auction, making it an unlikely reason for the respondent's failure to make the balance payment.
- The respondent was granted a 90-day extension to make the balance payment and was reminded that no further extensions would be granted.
- The sale notice and correspondence between the bank and the respondent were clear about the consequences of failing to make the balance payment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
- The High Court committed an egregious error in passing the impugned judgment and order.
- The respondent's failure to make the balance payment was not due to any exceptional circumstance but rather his own financial capacity and willingness to participate in the e-auction.
- The appeals filed by the bank succeed, and the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court are hereby set aside. The SA No. 143 of 2018 filed by the respondent before the DRT-II also stands dismissed.

<FACTS>
The case involves the issue of child marriage and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006. The court notes that there are conflicting opinions among High Courts regarding the precedence of PCMA over personal laws governing marriage.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes certain gaps in the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006, considering Constitutional guarantees accruing to children. The Union's note submitted after the judgment was reserved suggests that the Ministry of Women & Child Development recommends that the Hon'ble Court consider issuing directions pronouncing that PCMA will prevail over personal laws governing marriage.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the Ministry of Women and Child Development to circulate this judgment to the Chief Secretaries/Administrators of all States and Union Territories, as well as NALSA, and NCPCR for strict compliance with the directions. The writ petition is disposed of.

<FACTS>
The case involves a Mega Power Project and the eligibility of the project for certain benefits. The Ministry of Power granted the project Mega Power Status on 30.07.2010, but the decision was announced on 01.10.2009, and notifications were issued by the concerned Ministries of the Government of India on 11.12.2009 and 14.12.2009.
The respondent had filed an application for Mega Power Status on 11.05.2010, which became eligible on 16.04.2010.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the press release of 01.10.2009 was a change in law and that the project should be entitled to benefits from that date.
The respondent countered that the decision for granting Mega Power Status was taken/announced on 01.10.2009, but the notifications were issued later, and the benefits would only be applicable from 30.07.2010.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the press release of 01.10.2009 was not an "order" under Clause 1.1, and therefore, it could not be considered as a change in law.
The court also noted that the decision to grant Mega Power Status was taken/announced on 01.10.2009, but the notifications were issued later, and the benefits would only be applicable from 30.07.2010.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Civil Appeal is dismissed. The court upheld the concurrent judgments of the courts below, ruling that the benefits for the project would only be applicable from 30.07.2010, not from any prior date.
No order as to costs was made.

The case involves Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, who has filed an appeal against his arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The CBI had registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Kejriwal in connection with alleged irregularities in the recruitment process for the post of Chairman and Managing Director of the Delhi Jal Board. 
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant (Arvind Kejriwal) are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but it can be inferred that his defense against the arrest is likely to focus on the legitimacy of the CBI's action and the alleged irregularities in the FIR. 
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that there was a concurrent opinion among the judges that the appellant was entitled to be released on bail, subject to certain terms and conditions mentioned in the order.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Supreme Court directed Arvind Kejriwal to be released on bail, subject to the following terms and conditions:
a. The Appellant is directed to be released on bail in connection with FIR No. RC0032022A0053/2022 registered by the CBI at PS CBI, ACB, upon furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/- with two sureties of such like amount, to the satisfaction of the Trial Court;
b. The Appellant shall not make any public comments on the merits of the CBI case, it being sub judice before the Trial Court.
c. However, this shall not preclude the Appellant from raising all his contentions before the Trial Court;
d. The terms and conditions imposed by a coordinate bench of this Court vide orders dated 10.05.2024 and 12.07.2024 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 2493/2024 are imposed mutatis mutandis in the present case.
e. The Appellant shall remain present before the Trial Court on each and every date of hearing, unless granted exemption;
f. The Appellant shall fully cooperate with the Trial Court for expeditious conclusion of the trial proceedings.

The Criminal Appeal challenging the legality of arrest is dismissed, and the Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.11023/2024 is allowed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves custodial torture by the police, resulting in the death of a person named Shama @ Kalya. The police claim that Shama escaped from their custody on December 24, 1995. However, evidence suggests that Deepak Lokhande (PW-8) allegedly impersonated Shama and staged a performance to support the police version. The appellants were convicted under Section 304 Part-II IPC read with Section 34 IPC but were let off lightly by not being given stricter punishment.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
Proponents of the accused argued that in the absence of evidence regarding the homicidal death of Shama @ Kalya, the appellants are entitled to be acquitted of the charge under Section 304 Part-II IPC read with Section 34 IPC. They sought to grant them the benefit of doubt.

The respondent (judge) disagreed with this argument and maintained that the convictions and sentences of the appellants should stand.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The case highlights issues related to custodial torture by police, lack of accountability within the police organization, and inadequate laws to deal with such cases. The judge observes that despite decades having passed since the recommendation for reversing the burden of proof in cases of custodial death was made, it has not been implemented.

It is also noted that Section 29 of the Indian Police Act, 1861, makes willful breach of regulations by a policeman and causing unwarrantable personal violence to any person in their custody punishable. However, this law is not being enforced effectively.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The respondent judge maintains the convictions and sentences of the appellants and dismisses all appeals. The judge believes that giving in to the accused's duplicitous stories and permitting them to escape punishment would only add insult to injury.

The judgment also suggests that the police should be accountable for their actions, and courts can play a crucial role in policing the police by holding them responsible for their wrongdoing.
</JUDGMENT>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a civil appeal related to a High Court's decision regarding the appointment of a respondent. The respondent had been denied appointment by the Managing Director (MD) & CEO of the appellant company, citing unsuitability. The respondent then filed a writ petition, which was granted by the Division Bench of the High Court, directing the MD & CEO to appoint the respondent.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
- The respondent had been denied appointment on grounds of unsuitability.
- The Division Bench of the High Court directed the MD & CEO to appoint the respondent, relying on a previous judgment (Canara Bank).
- However, it was observed that the Division Bench did not examine the criterion of suitability while directing the appointment.
- A coordinate bench had considered making a direction for payment of a lumpsum amount to the respondent towards full and final settlement.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
- The court disagreed with the judgment in Canara Bank, which was relied upon by the Division Bench.
- The court observed that the Division Bench did not examine the criterion of suitability while directing the appointment.
- A reference to a larger bench would add to the agony and pain of the respondent considering the uncertainty of an imminent resolution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is as follows:
- The impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench, as well as that of the Single Bench, stands set aside.
- The civil appeal is allowed on the terms that the appellant will make a lumpsum payment of Rs. 2.5 lakh to the respondent within two months from the date of the order.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The petition was filed after an award was passed by an arbitrator on a particular date. However, the copy of the award was served to the litigating party, who was seriously ill and hospitalized for months together. Due to this reason, the party was unable to prefer a petition under Section 34 within the prescribed period of limitation.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the judges include:

* The statute (Arbitration and Conciliation Act) prescribes its own period of limitation, which is different from the one mentioned in the Schedule of the Limitation Act. This deviation creates confusion among lawyers and litigants.
* The condonable period for delay beyond a certain period is restricted to 30 days or less in some statutes, as opposed to Section 5 of the Limitation Act which allows the court to condone delays if sufficient cause is shown.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the judges include:

* The deviation from the prescribed period of limitation and the restriction on condoning delays create technicalities that can lead to cases being thrown out on grounds of limitation, even when there is a good case on merit.
* Uniformity in law would be achieved if all statutes followed the principle of condoning delays as enshrined under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the judges states that:

* The petition under Section 34 was dismissed by the High Court as it was beyond the period of limitation prescribed.
* The delay in challenging the award could not have been condoned, and therefore, there is no error or illegality on part of the High Court in dismissing the petition.
* The judges suggest to lawmakers that they should ensure uniformity in law while enacting new Acts and follow the principle of condoning delays as per Section 5 of the Limitation Act.

Note: This judgment was delivered by a single judge, Pankaj Mithal. It is not clear if this is the final decision or if there will be an appeal.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a suit filed under O.S. No. 25968 of 2018, which claimed that Rs. 2,00,000/- and above was paid by cash towards consideration for the conveyance of an immovable property. The court observed that this transaction violates Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
The jurisdictional Income Tax Department was not informed about this transaction, as required under law. This led to a failure on the part of the registering authority and the jurisdictional Sub-Registrar to intimate the same to the Income Tax Authority.
The court noted that such transactions often go unnoticed or are not brought to the knowledge of the income tax authorities, leading to ignorance in fact being excusable but not ignorance in law.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court held that the plaint ought to have been rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) CPC. This was because the suit claimed a violation of Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which requires intimation to the jurisdictional Income Tax Department in cases where Rs. 2,00,000/- and above is paid by cash.
The court argued that ignorance in fact may be excusable, but ignorance in law is not a valid defense. Therefore, the registering authority's failure to intimate the transaction to the Income Tax Authority was considered a lapse on their part.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there has been no desired change since the amendment came into effect from 01.04.2017. The law in place is not being enforced, allowing such transactions to go unnoticed or unreported.
The court noted that it was a settled position that ignorance of law is not an excuse for non-compliance with legal requirements. Therefore, the registering authority's failure to intimate the transaction was considered a lapse on their part.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment of the High Court dated 02.06.2022 and the order of the trial Court dated 11.06.2021 are set aside.
The application filed under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) CPC is allowed. The plaint in O.S. No. 25968 of 2018 pending on the file of XIII Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Mayohall Unit, Bengaluru, is rejected.
The directions given by the court are to be intimated by the Registrars of the High Courts, the Chief Secretaries of the States/Union Territories, and the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax Department to the District Judiciary, the officials of the registration department, and the jurisdictional officers under the Income Tax Department respectively. This is to facilitate the conduct of periodical audit.
The parties are directed to bear their respective costs throughout the proceedings. Miscellaneous Applications, if any, stand disposed of.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around a land acquisition dispute between the appellants and the State, KIADB (Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board), and other respondents. The appellants had filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the legality of the notification issued by the State under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The notification was issued for acquiring land for a industrial project.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented in the case are:

*   The appellants claimed that the land acquisition proceedings were initiated without following the correct procedure and that the compensation awarded to them was inadequate.
*   The State and KIADB argued that the notification issued under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was valid and that the compensation awarded to the appellants was in accordance with the law.
*   Respondent Nos. 6 and 7 contended that they cannot be imposed with a liability for the huge additional expenditure and that the delay in determination of compensation and payment of the same is not attributable to them but is on account of inaction on the part of the State and KIADB.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the land acquisition proceedings were delayed, and the appellants' constitutional right under Article 300-A was violated. The Court also noted that if the land acquisition proceedings are quashed, the only recourse available to the State/KIADB will be to issue a fresh acquisition notification by invoking the provisions as applicable under the 2013 LA Act which would entail huge expenditure to the public exchequer.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court disposed of the appeal in the following terms:

*   The judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court dated 22nd November 2022 in Writ Appeal No. 678 of 2022 (LA-KIADB) is quashed and set aside.
*   The writ petition filed by the appellants before the High Court being W.P. No. 1627 of 2021 is allowed.
*   The SLAO shall pass a fresh award taking the market value prevailing as on 22nd April 2019 within a period of two months from today after hearing the parties.
*   The appellants herein shall be entitled to all statutory benefits as are available to them in law.
*   The rights of parties to challenge the award in reference, if they are aggrieved by it, shall remain open.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between two companies, Inox and LNG, regarding the ownership of certain intellectual property rights (IPRs). The plaintiff, Inox, claims that it owns the IPRs, while the defendant, LNG, disputes this. The case revolves around the nature of the "Proprietary Engineering Drawings" and whether they constitute an "artistic work" under the Copyright Act or a "design" under the Designs Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Inox's argument: 
- Inox claims that the Proprietary Engineering Drawings are original artistic works, entitled to protection under the Copyright Act.
- Inox argues that the Commercial Court misread the plaint and misapplied legal principles in dismissing its case.

LNG's (defendant) argument:
- LNG disputes Inox's claim, arguing that the drawings constitute a design rather than an artistic work.

High Court's argument:
- The High Court agrees with Inox's argument, stating that the question of whether the original artistic work falls within the meaning of "design" under the Designs Act cannot be answered at the preliminary stage.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The case highlights the complexities and nuances involved in interpreting intellectual property laws in India. The High Court's decision underscores the need for a thorough understanding of these laws to ensure accurate application and interpretation.

The Commercial Court's dismissal of Inox's case was based on incorrect assumptions, misreading of the plaint, and misapplication of legal principles. This led to a miscarriage of justice, prompting the High Court to intervene and direct the Commercial Court to conduct a trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court dismisses the appeals, upholding its decision rejecting LNG's application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC.

Directions:

i. The Commercial Court is directed to deliver its decision on the pending application seeking interim injunction preferred by Inox within a period of two months.
ii. The Commercial Court is further directed to conduct trial and discern the true nature of the Proprietary Engineering Drawings based upon the test laid down in paragraph 60 of the judgment, as also the other related IP right infringements claimed by Inox, within a period of one year.

Case No.: SLP (Crl.) No.13956/2023
</FUNCT>

<FACTS>
The Special Court had issued bailable warrants against the respondents, who were aware of the pendency of the complaint proceedings against them. However, they kept on avoiding the execution of such warrants and did not appear before the Special Court.
The Special Court subsequently passed detailed orders for the issuance of non-bailable warrants and initiated Proclamation proceedings under Section 82 of the Code to require the respondents to appear before it.
The High Court granted anticipatory bail to the respondents despite the well-settled legal position that such bail cannot be granted when a criminal proceeding is pending against an accused.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
- The Special Court's actions in issuing bailable and non-bailable warrants, as well as initiating Proclamation proceedings, were justified considering the seriousness of the alleged offenses.
- Granting anticipatory bail by the High Court was perverse and untenable at law, especially when a criminal proceeding is pending against an accused.
- The respondents' consistent avoidance of appearing before the Special Court necessitated stricter measures to ensure their presence in court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
None
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court granting anticipatory bail to the respondents. 
The Court directed the respondents to surrender themselves before the Special Court within one week from the date of the order.
Their bail applications, as and when filed, would be decided by the Special Court in accordance with law.

<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the High Court's judgment, where the High Court dismissed the appellants' claim to certain properties. The appellants had contended that they were the owners of the properties and had been wrongfully dispossessed by the respondents.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the High Court erred in dismissing their claim on the grounds that there was no documentary evidence to prove their ownership of the properties. They also contended that the respondents' possession of the properties was unlawful and that they had been denied justice by the High Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Registration Act, 1908 provides for compulsory registration of certain documents related to immovable property, including those creating or transferring rights in such property. The court noted that registration provides public notice, prevents fraud and forgery, and gives publicity to transactions affecting immovable property.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court, which held that the appellants failed to produce any documentary evidence to prove their ownership of the properties. The court also observed that the respondents' possession of the properties was lawful and that they had been denied justice by the High Court.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the maintainability and timeliness of an application filed under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The respondent had unconditionally withdrawn its first arbitration petition and then filed a fresh application under the same provision. The appellant challenged the maintainability and timeliness of this fresh application.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent relied on paragraph 35 of the judgment in BSNL v. Telephone Cables Limited (2010) 5 SCC 213, which stated that the court was reserving liberty to the respondent to avail remedies available in law. The respondent argued that this liberty conferred upon it the right to file a fresh application under Section 11(6) of the Act, even though it was beyond the prescribed period of three years and hit by principles analogous to Order 23 Rule 1.
The respondent also claimed entitlement to the benefit of Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act, which provides for condonation of delay in filing applications. The respondent argued that it had sufficient cause for not filing the application within time and that there was no loss or prejudice caused to the other party.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the liberty reserved by the court in paragraph 35 did not confer a right upon the respondent to file a proceeding that is not otherwise permissible under law. The court also noted that the respondent had unconditionally withdrawn its first arbitration petition and then filed a fresh application, which was beyond the prescribed period of three years.
The court further observed that the principles analogous to Order 23 Rule 1 would apply in this case, rendering the fresh application time-barred.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
(i) The fresh application filed by the respondent under Section 11(6) of the Act was not maintainable due to the lack of any liberty being granted at the time of withdrawal of the first application.
(ii) The fresh application was time-barred as it was beyond the prescribed period of three years and hit by principles analogous to Order 23 Rule 1.
(iii) The respondent was not entitled to the benefit of Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act, which provides for condonation of delay in filing applications.
(iv) The respondent was also not entitled to the benefit of condonation of delay under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
The appeal filed by the appellant was allowed, and the impugned order passed by the High Court of Bombay was set aside. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. The parties shall bear their own costs.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the status of the 1st respondent-Doha Bank under the Debtors and Creditors (D & C) Act. The appellants, who are part of the Committee of Creditors (CoC), had challenged the status of the 1st respondent as a financial creditor. The case revolves around the interpretation of the Deed of Hypothecation (DoH) and its applicability to the Doha Bank's claim.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
* Section 5(iii)(b) of the DoH, which deals with the hypothecation of the properties, is invalid due to the applicability of the moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC.
* The definition of "claim" under Section 3(6) of the IBC attracts the guarantee obligation even if the cause of action for invoking the guarantee has not arisen.
* The CoC, including the appellants and third-party lenders, had voted in favor of the Resolution Plan.
The respondents argued that:
* The DoH is a valid agreement between the parties and its provisions are severable.
* The 1st respondent-Doha Bank's claim as a financial creditor is valid.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The NCLAT had initially upheld the status of the Doha Bank as a financial creditor. However, the present appeal was filed against this order. The bench noted that the NCLAT had not held against the appellants on the ground that accepting their case would amount to modification of the Resolution Plan.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* The impugned judgment and order passed by the NCLAT cannot be sustained, and the order dated 2nd March 2021 of the NCLT deserves to be upheld.
* The DoH will continue to be valid; however, something prohibited by Section 14 cannot be done under it.
* The definition of "claim" under Section 3(6) of the IBC attracts the guarantee obligation even if the cause of action for invoking the guarantee has not arisen.
* The appeals are allowed, and the impugned order of the NCLAT is quashed and set aside. The order dated 2nd March 2021 passed by the NCLT, Mumbai Bench (adjudicating authority), is restored.

The case involves the reservation of a plot of land under Section 126 and 127 of the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning (MRTP) Act. The respondents served a notice for acquisition, but no steps were taken by the authorities to issue a notification after receipt of the notice.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the reservation of the plot could be said to have lapsed due to the efflux of time under Sections 126 and 127 of the MRTP Act. They relied on the judgments in Kolhapur Municipal Corporation v. Vasant Mahadev Patil (dead), through LRs & Ors. and Municipal Corpn., Greater Mumbai v. Hiraman Sitaram Deorukhar to support their argument.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that when a reservation is deemed to have lapsed under Section 127(1) of the MRTP Act, it lapses for all purposes and for all times to come. The land becomes free, and the landowners can use it as if there was no reservation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals and set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court. It declared that the reservation of the plot in question could be said to have lapsed by efflux of time in view of the provisions under Sections 126 and 127 of the MRTP Act respectively.

<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the interpretation of Section 33(1) of the 1996 Act. The respondent sought clarification from the learned Arbitrator, which was permitted by the court beyond the initial period of 30 days. The appellant participated in the clarificatory proceeding and did not raise any objections.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the learned Arbitrator had become functus officio and therefore lacked jurisdiction to issue the clarification. They also contended that the interest portion is covered by the contract agreement between the parties, which would render Section 31(7)(a) and (b) of the 1996 Act inapplicable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the expression "unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties" in Section 33(1) of the 1996 Act would cover the present case. The court also noted that the respondent had been permitted to seek clarification from the learned Arbitrator beyond the initial period, and the appellant participated in the proceeding.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the clarification sought for and issued by the learned Arbitrator would be covered by the expression "unless another period of time has been agreed upon by the parties" in Section 33(1) of the 1996 Act. The court also held that Section 31(7)(a) and (b) of the 1996 Act would have their full effect, and the sum awarded would mean the principal amount plus the interest awarded from the date of cause of action upto the date of the award.

The case revolves around a dispute between the Appellant (Ms. Reena) and the Respondent (Mr. Anil Kumar), regarding the legitimacy of Mr. Anil Kumar's son, with Ms. Reena claiming to be the biological mother.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Appellant's arguments:

* The Appellant (Ms. Reena) is the biological mother of Mr. Anil Kumar's son, and thus, the child's legitimacy is a matter between her and her husband (Mr. Raju Kurian), as per Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
* The Munsiff Court and Sub-Judge Court had jurisdiction to entertain the Original Suit regarding the question of Mr. Anil Kumar's son's legitimacy.

Respondent's arguments:

* The Respondent (Mr. Anil Kumar) claimed that his son was legitimate as per Section 6 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
* The Family Court reopened the Maintenance Petition, which was barred by the principle of res judicata.

Applicant's arguments:

* The Appellant (Ms. Reena) argued that allowing the second round of litigation after the issue was already settled inter partes is a misuse of judicial time and resources.
* The principle of res judicata applies to the case, as the issue of legitimacy was conclusively decided by the High Court in 2011.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a suit filed by Respondent No.1 in Special Civil Suit No.133 of 2009 against the appellants. The suit was dismissed by the trial court, and the order was affirmed by the High Court. The appellants filed an appeal against the dismissal of their application under Order VII Rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), which sought to reject the plaint for being hopelessly barred by limitation.
The respondent claimed that a compromise decree had been passed in Spl. Civil Suit Nos.l52/1951 and 1622/1988, and Civil Appeal No.787/2001, Pune. The respondent alleged that fraud was played on him by the defendants in obtaining these compromise decrees.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the respondent were:

*   The suit was not barred by limitation as the respondent had been continuously asserting his rights and title since 1988.
*   The plea of fraud raised by the respondent was based on vague and unsubstantiated averments, which did not demonstrate any clear case of fraud.
*   The respondent could not seek a declaration that the compromise decrees passed in Spl. Civil Suit Nos.l52/1951 and 1622/1988, and Civil Appeal No.787/2001, Pune were void ab initio, null and void, and liable to be set aside, as he was a stranger to these suits.
*   The bar under Order XXIII Rule 3A of CPC applied to the respondent's claim.

On the other hand, the appellants argued that:

*   The suit was hopelessly barred by limitation as the respondent had failed to assert his rights and title in time.
*   The respondent's plea of fraud was an attempt to overcome the period of limitation.
*   The respondent was bound by the compromise decrees passed in Spl. Civil Suit Nos.l52/1951 and 1622/1988, and Civil Appeal No.787/2001, Pune.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Hon'ble Judges observed that:

*   Limitation is a mixed question of fact and law.
*   In cases where it is clear from the plaint averments that the suit is hopelessly barred by limitation, the courts should not hesitate to grant relief and drive the parties back to the trial court.
*   The respondent's claim was an abuse of process as he had failed to assert his rights and title in time.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Judges held that:

*   The suit was hopelessly barred by limitation, and the plaint was liable to be rejected at the threshold.
*   The respondent's plea of fraud was not supported by any evidence and was an attempt to overcome the period of limitation.
*   The bar under Order XXIII Rule 3A of CPC applied to the respondent's claim.

The appeal was allowed, and the orders passed by the courts below were set aside. The application filed by the appellants under Order VII Rule 11(d) of CPC was also allowed, and the plaint in Special Civil Suit No.133 of 2009 was rejected.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the validity of the Regulations of 2016 framed by the Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) under Section 181 read with Section 42 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The regulations pertain to open access, scheduling, and penalties in the distribution sector.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants challenged the Regulations of 2016 before the High Court, arguing that they were arbitrary and unreasonable. They claimed that the regulations imposed onerous conditions for open access consumers, including limits on drawal, penalties for non-compliance with scheduling norms, and charges for wheeling and transmission.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court held that any inconvenience caused or hardship faced by captive power generators would not make the regulations illegal. The court also observed that the appellants failed to establish that the impugned regulations were in contravention of their rights protected under Part-III of the Constitution of India.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals and upheld the orders of the High Court, holding that the Regulations of 2016 were valid and in consonance with the objects of the Electricity Act, 2003. The court observed that the regulations had been framed by the RERC within its statutory powers under Section 181 read with Section 42 of the Act.

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a bail application under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The High Court granted bail to the respondent based on the inferences and surmises that the compliance of Section 52A was not done within a reasonable time. However, the Supreme Court notes that the impugned order ignored the statutory provision of the Act and the mandate contained in Section 37 of the Act.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The appellants argued that the High Court's decision to grant bail was erroneous as it ignored the mandatory requirements under Section 37(1)(b) of the NDPS Act. They further contended that any procedural irregularity or illegality committed during the investigation would not make the entire evidence inadmissible.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The Supreme Court observes that the purpose of inserting Section 52A was to ensure early disposal of seized contraband drugs and substances. The court notes that sub-section (2) of Section 52A lays down the procedure for disposal, and any lapse or delayed compliance thereof would be merely a procedural irregularity.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allows the appeal and sets aside the impugned order granting bail to the respondent. The court remands the case to the High Court for deciding the bail application afresh on merits and in accordance with law. The period of bail granted to the respondent is extended by four weeks, with a request to the High Court to decide the application as expeditiously as possible.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the imposition and collection of user fees or tolls by Noida Toll Bridge Company Limited (NTBCL) on the DND Flyway, a major highway connecting Delhi to Noida. The respondent welfare association filed a writ petition in public interest against NTBCL and the State authorities, alleging that the contract awarded to NTBCL through the Concession Agreement was unfair, unjust, and inconsistent with Constitutional norms.

The concession agreement granted NTBCL the right to collect user fees or tolls from motorists using the DND Flyway. However, it also allowed NTBCL to recover the project costs and substantial profits, leading to allegations of private profiteering at the expense of public funds.

Noida (Respondent No. 2) has alleged that NTBCL owes them substantial dues accrued through outdoor advertising for which a license had been granted by Noida.

The case is also related to the arbitration proceedings between Noida and NTBCL, concerning the challenge to the arbitration proceedings.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:

* The concession agreement was unfair, unjust, and inconsistent with Constitutional norms.
* Noida exceeded its authority by delegating the power to levy fees or impose tolls to NTBCL, rendering such delegation invalid.
* Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, read with the formula in Annexure F, contravenes public policy and is therefore liable to be severed from the agreement.
* NTBCL has recovered the project costs and substantial profits, eliminating any justification for the continued imposition or collection of user fees or tolls.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:

* The High Court rightly entertained the writ petition filed by Respondent No. 1, who had the requisite locus standi.
* There were no delay or laches in approaching the High Court.
* Had Respondent No. 1 not been vigilant of their rights, the public funds would have continued to be misappropriated for private profiteering.

</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

* The instant appeal is consequently dismissed.
* The contract awarded to NTBCL through the Concession Agreement was unfair, unjust and inconsistent with Constitutional norms.
* Noida exceeded its authority by delegating the power to levy fees or impose tolls to NTBCL, rendering such delegation invalid.
* Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, read with the formula in Annexure F, contravenes public policy and is therefore liable to be severed from the agreement.
* NTBCL has recovered the project costs and substantial profits, eliminating any justification for the continued imposition or collection of user fees or tolls.

The court also clarified that the issue pertaining to outdoor licensing fees between Noida and NTBCL does not fall within the purview of the present challenge.

The petitioners, candidates who had applied for the position, argued that the selection process was not transparent and did not adhere to the prescribed timeline.
</FACTS>

- The validity challenge to Clause 11 of the Bihar Rules, 1951 and Rule 8(3) of the Gujarat Rules, 2005 (as amended in 2011) prescribing minimum marks for interview are valid.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) by Awaz and others against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The complainants alleged that the RBI had not taken any action to control the excessive rates of interest charged by banks on credit cards. They claimed that the RBI's failure to regulate the rates was unfair and constituted an "unfair trade practice".
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The RBI argued that it did not have the authority to fix a standardized rate of interest for all banks, as this would interfere with the financial wisdom of individual banks. The RBI further stated that the banks were communicating the rates of interest to their customers and that there was no material on record to establish that any bank had acted contrary to the policy directives issued by the RBI.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The NCDRC observed that the RBI had communicated its policy directives to the banks, which included guidelines for the calculation of interest rates. The commission noted that the banks were not making any misrepresentation or deception regarding the rates of interest, and that the customers were made aware of the terms and conditions before availing the credit card facility.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals filed by the RBI and set aside the final judgment/order dated 07.07.2008 passed by the NCDRC in "Awaz & Ors. Vs Reserve Bank of India". The court held that the RBI did not have the authority to fix a standardized rate of interest for all banks, and that the rates charged by the banks were based on their financial wisdom and directives issued by the RBI.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over the dishonor of a cheque worth Rs 7,00,000. The complainant had issued the cheque to the accused, who drew it on his company's account. However, the cheque was returned due to insufficiency of funds. The complainant sent a statutory notice to the accused, but he failed to respond.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the case. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the prosecution's argument was that the accused is liable for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) since he drew the cheque on an account not maintained by him.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the statutory provisions creating penal liability cannot be stretched too far to embrace persons and situations patently excluded from its purview. The court also noted that the language of Section 138 of the NI Act clearly postulates that the cheque returned for insufficiency of funds should have been drawn by a person on an account maintained by him.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the accused cannot be held liable for the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act since he drew the cheque on his company's account. However, the court observed that the possibility of the accused having committed the offence of cheating cannot be ruled out. The court left it open to the complainant to approach the jurisdictional police station and lodge an appropriate FIR against the accused.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a writ petition filed by the Petitioner, a Member of Legislative Council (MLC), challenging his expulsion from the BLC. The Petitioner was expelled after being found guilty of misconduct during a legislative proceeding.
The Respondents include the Election Commission and other members of the BLC.
The Petitioner claims that the punishment meted out to him was excessive and disproportionate to the nature of the misconduct committed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Petitioner argues that the Constitutional Courts have jurisdiction to examine the proportionality of the punishment imposed on a Member while reviewing the validity of the action taken by the House.
The Petitioner contends that the period of expulsion already undergone should be deemed as a period of suspension, and that this would be sufficient punishment for his misdemeanour.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observes that the issues raised in the writ petition do not fall within the restrictions outlined under Article 212 (1) of the Constitution of India.
The Court notes that there is no absolute bar on the Constitutional Courts to examine the proportionality of the punishment imposed on a Member while reviewing the validity of the action taken by the House.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allows the writ petition and sets aside the Impugned Report of the Ethics Committee as well as the Notification of the BLC, only to the extent of nature of punishment it recommends to be imposed on the Petitioner.
The Petitioner is directed to be reinstated as a member of the BLC with immediate effect. However, he shall not be entitled to claim any remuneration or other monetary benefits for the period of his disbandment.
Should the Petitioner indulge further in such misconduct upon his reinstatement, it is left to the Ethics Committee or Chairperson of the BLC to take appropriate action, in accordance with law.
The Press Note dated 30.12.2024 issued by Respondent No. 6, Election Commission, declaring the bye-election for the seat earlier held by the Petitioner is hereby quashed, and any action taken pursuant to such Press Note is annulled.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals and writ petitions filed by various individuals (appellants/petitioners) seeking to stay prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (N.I. Act), relying on the interim moratorium under Section 96 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC). The appellants/petitioners had issued cheques which were dishonored, resulting in criminal proceedings against them under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Courts had refused to stay the section 138 proceedings, holding that the moratorium provision under IBC does not apply to civil actions to recover debt and the deterrent effect of Section 138 is critical to maintain trust in negotiable instruments like cheques in business dealings. The appellants/petitioners argued that the decisions relied upon by the High Courts dealt with proceedings under section 14 IBC and not the proceedings under section 96 IBC, and therefore, their contention cannot be countenanced.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the provision enabling the debtor to approach the Tribunal under Section 94 is not to stall the criminal prosecution but only to postpone any civil actions to recover debt. The court also noted that the approval of the resolution plan per se does not operate as a discharge of guarantors' liability, and similarly, the signatory/Director cannot take benefit of discharge obtained by the corporate debtor by operation of law under IBC.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the object of moratorium is to only postpone any civil actions to recover debt and not to stall the criminal prosecution. The court further observed that allowing the respective appellants/petitioners to evade prosecution under Section 138 by invoking the moratorium would undermine the very purpose of the N.I. Act, 1881. Therefore, the prayer of the appellants/petitioners to stay the prosecution under Section 138 was refused. The judgments/orders passed by the different High Courts affirming the orders of the trial court were upheld.

The person had raised the plea of juvenility, but it was not dealt with under the existing laws at the relevant point of time. Despite the error committed by the Courts, the person has been suffering due to the prolonged imprisonment.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* The Court should have dealt with the plea of juvenility under the existing laws at the relevant point of time.
* The Executive cannot be construed to have undertaken an adjudication on the determination of the age of the accused.
* The Appellant has been suffering due to the error committed by the Courts and has lost an opportunity to reintegrate into society.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the case include:
* The Appellant's conduct in prison is normal, with no adverse report.
* The time lost cannot be restored, as it was for no fault of the Appellant.
* The Society has undergone significant transformation during the Appellant's imprisonment, and he might find it difficult to adjust upon release.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered in the case is as follows:
* The Appeal is allowed, and the impugned judgment stands set aside.
* The sentence imposed against the Appellant in excess of the upper limit prescribed under the relevant Act shall stand set aside, while making it clear that the conviction shall continue.

The case revolves around the acquisition of land for public purpose under the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act (RUIA). The Government of Himachal Pradesh, through JAL (Joint Advisory Committee), initiated acquisition proceedings for land in Nangli Kota. However, the compensation was not paid to the landowners within the specified timeline as per Section 60A(4) of the RUIA.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the parties involved are:
- The High Court's order declaring the notification under Section 52(1) invalid on grounds that compensation was not deposited and paid to the respondents within the specified timeline as per Section 60A(4) of the RUIA.
- The acquisition process was not fair and in accordance with law due to the improper procedure adopted by the State Government and the appellant Trust when they took possession of the Nangli Kota lands before depositing compensation for the same, which is a contravention of Section 52(7) of the RUIA.

The court references several previous cases:
- Kukreja Construction Company & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors., (2024 SCC Online SC 2547)
- N. Padmamma v. S. Ramakrishna Reddy, (2008) 15 SCC 517
- Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Darius Shapur Chenai, [(2005) 7 SCC 627]

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
- Time is of the essence in determining and paying compensation as evident from the judgment in Kukreja Construction Company & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors., (2024 SCC Online SC 2547).
- The Government of Himachal Pradesh, as a welfare state, should have proactively intervened to ensure that the requisite amount towards compensation was paid at the earliest.
- The delay in paying compensation to landowners after taking away ownership of the subject land from them is in contravention to the spirit of the constitutional scheme of Article 300A and the idea of a welfare State.

The court also notes:
- If a right of property is a human right as also a constitutional right, it cannot be taken away except in accordance with law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The High Court's order declaring the notification under Section 52(1) invalid on grounds that compensation was not deposited and paid to the respondents within the specified timeline as per Section 60A(4) of the RUIA is upheld by the court.

As a result, the appeals stand dismissed. Parties shall bear their own cost. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.

</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case deals with the interpretation of the provisions of an Act, specifically regarding the binding precedent status of certain judgments. The court notes that not all judgments are intended to be binding precedents under Article 141 of the Constitution.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff's argument is based on the precedential value of the judgments in Silpi Industries (supra) and Mahakali Foods (supra), as well as subsequent orders in Vaishno Enterprises (supra) and M/s Nitesh Estates (supra). The court, however, is cautious about considering these judgments as binding precedents due to their decision-making nature rather than precedent-making.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that the distinction between decision-making and precedent-making can be challenging for High Courts and subordinate courts to determine. It also highlights the need for clarity and certainty in applicable precedents on the subject.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court ultimately decides to refer the appeal to a three-Judge Bench due to the compelling need to ensure clarity and certainty about the applicable precedents on the subject. The Registry is directed to place the appeal paperbooks along with the detailed judgment before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate Bench.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case involves a criminal appeal regarding the seizure of a vehicle under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The owner of the vehicle, an appellant, has sought the release of the vehicle on superdari, alleging that its continued custody by the police would serve no purpose and would result in the depreciation of its value.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's argument is based on Section 36-C read with Section 51 of the NDPS Act, which makes the Criminal Procedure Code applicable for proceedings before a Special Court under the NDPS Act. The appellant also relies on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai v. State of Gujarat (2002) 10 SCC 283, which held that it is not necessary to keep seized vehicles at police stations for an extended period and that it is open to the Magistrate to pass appropriate orders immediately by taking a bond and guarantee as well as security for the return of the vehicle.
</ARGUMENTS>

<Observations>
The court observes that if the Vehicle in question is kept in the custody of the police till the trial is over, it will serve no purpose. The vehicles stored in police custody are typically kept in open spaces, which can result in their depreciation due to exposure to the elements.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
Consequently, the present Criminal Appeal is allowed with directions to the trial Court to release the Vehicle in question in the interim on superdari after preparing a video and still photographs of the vehicle and obtaining all necessary information/documents for its identification. The appellant shall not sell or part with the ownership of the Vehicle till conclusion of the trial and shall furnish an undertaking to the trial court that he shall surrender the Vehicle within one week of being so directed and/or pay the value of the Vehicle (determined according to Income Tax law on the date of its release), if so ultimately directed by the Court.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a lessee, Respondent No.1, who was granted a special lease on certain conditions to provide accommodation for the "poorer classes". The property was leased with minimal rent and under prescribed conditions. However, the lessee attempted to convert the arrangement into a vehicle for commercial gain.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant (likely the public authority or the original grantor) argued against the lessee's attempt to commercially exploit the property and undermine the social welfare objectives of the 1925 Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that allowing the lessee to disregard the obligations under the lease would set a precedent for hollowing out protections and advantages established by the statute. This would undermine trust and faith between public authorities, private actors, and vulnerable segments of the population.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the High Court was set aside, and the writ petition was dismissed. The court held that the lessee's conduct amounted to an abuse of beneficial legislation, as it sought to commercially exploit a property allocated under a special scheme for "poorer classes" accommodation.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves several land acquisition matters filed by various claimants against the State of Maharashtra and the Executive Engineer. The cases pertain to different locations in Akoli (kd) and involve varying areas of land. Section 4 notifications under the Land Acquisition Act were issued on different dates, ranging from July 2000 to December 1999. Subsequent Section 6 notifications were also issued, followed by awards made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The claimants argued for higher compensation rates based on market value, citing the land's potential for residential and commercial use. They relied on various factors such as proximity to urban areas, road connectivity, and existing infrastructure. The State and the Executive Engineer, on the other hand, contended that the original award made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer was fair and reasonable.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court confirmed the Reference Court's order granting compensation at Rs. 100 per sq. ft. The court observed that the claimants' reliance on market value was not justified, given the land's limited use for agricultural purposes. The court also noted that the claimants failed to provide sufficient evidence of higher market rates.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, affirming the compensation rate at Rs. 100 per sq. ft. The court held that the claimants' arguments were not supported by credible evidence and that the original award made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer was reasonable.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented in support of the appeal are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant's counsel may have argued in favor of releasing the appellant on bail, highlighting any mitigating circumstances or ensuring the appellant's attendance at future court proceedings.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The petitioner filed an arbitration petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The notice invoking arbitration was received by the respondent on 29.11.2022, which is within the three-year period from the date when the cause of action for the claim had arisen.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the claims sought to be arbitrated are not ex-facie dead claims and are thus not barred by limitation on the date of commencement of arbitration proceedings. The court should consider two aspects: whether the petition under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is barred by limitation; and secondly, whether the claims sought to be arbitrated are ex-facie dead claims and are thus barred by limitation on the date of commencement of arbitration proceedings.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the applicability of Section 137 to applications under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is a result of legislative vacuum as there is no statutory prescription regarding the time limit. The period of three years for filing an application under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 is considered unduly long and goes against the spirit of the Act, which provides for expeditious resolution of commercial disputes within a time-bound manner.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the petition and appointed Shri Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul as the sole arbitrator. The fees of the arbitrator and other modalities were to be fixed in consultation with the parties. The court also mentioned that it is considered necessary for the Parliament to consider bringing an amendment to the Act, 1996 prescribing a specific period of limitation within which a party may move the court for making an application for appointment of arbitrators under Section 11 of the Act, 1996.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of detention passed by the State government under the National Security Act, 1980. The appellant detenu was arrested on allegations of being involved in Maoist activities and was detained for a period of six months.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant's counsel were:
1. The order of detention was passed without following the due procedure of inquiry and consultation with the Advisory Board, as mandated under the National Security Act, 1980.
2. The grounds on which the order of detention was passed were vague and did not specify any concrete evidence against the detenu.
3. The detention order was an abuse of power by the State government and was aimed at suppressing the appellant's fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that:
1. The Advisory Board, comprising High Court judges or their equivalent, is a constitutional safeguard against arbitrary detention and is required to undertake a thorough scrutiny of the order of detention.
2. The role of the Advisory Board is not limited to merely satisfying itself with the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority but also includes ascertaining whether the detention order would withstand scrutiny in a court of law.
3. The Court emphasized the importance of independent scrutiny and the need for the Advisory Board to appreciate all aspects and angles before expressing any definite opinion in its report.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, and quashed the order of detention. The Court also directed that the appellant detenu be set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case. The connected Criminal Appeal No. ......... of 2024 @ SLP (Cri) No. 3391 of 2024 of the co-detenu was also allowed for the same reasons.

<FACTS>
The case involves an FIR registered under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act against the appellants for allegedly publishing or transmitting material that is obscene, lascivious, or appealing to prurient interest. The complaint specifically mentions excessive usage of vulgar expletives, swear words, and profanities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court's judgment was challenged by the appellants, who argued that:
* Section 67A is not attracted to the facts of the case as there is no allegation of any 'sexually explicit act or conduct'.
* The offence under Section 67A requires publication, transmission, or causing to publish/transmit material in electronic form containing sexually explicit act or conduct.
* There is no connect between Sections 67 and 67A, and the latter cannot be applied without a lascivious intent or appeal to prurient interests.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's judgment was set aside, and the FIR was quashed due to the following reasons:
* No offence under Section 67 of the IT Act is made out as there is no material that is obscene, lascivious, or appealing to prurient interest.
* Equally, no case under Section 67A is made out as there is no publication or transmission of material containing sexually explicit act or conduct.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeals against the judgment of the High Court and set aside the judgment. The FIR registered at Police Station Mukherjee Nagar, Delhi under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act was quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an acquisition of land under the Acquisition Act, 2013. The market value of the land must be computed to determine the compensation. The Commissioner applied the Collector's Guidelines by using the rate provided for non-converted agricultural land and supplemented this amount with the assets attached to the land and adding the solatium payable.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, argued that the circle rate is not the baseline or floor rate and is too high. The Commissioner applied the Collector's Guidelines by using the rate provided for non-converted agricultural land, which was fixed for the year 2014-2015.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that concerned authorities should fix circle rates scientifically and in accordance with the law. Circle rates are neither inflated nor disproportionately low when citizens pay stamp duty on the notified circle rate. The public authorities, including state development corporations acquiring land from private individuals, must adhere to the same.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the compensation has been calculated in accordance with the mandate of the Acquisition Act, 2013. Therefore, no reduction in the amount can be granted by applying the theory of deduction. The appeals filed by the appellant, Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation, were dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an accused who brutally murdered 4 unarmed and defenseless persons, including a child and an aged lady. The act was pre-planned/premeditated, and the accused has been in jail for 18 years and 4 months.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had imposed a sentence of 30 years imprisonment without remission under Section 302 IPC, which is challenged by the accused. The Supreme Court weighs the pros and cons of the matter, considering various factors such as the age of the accused (28 years old), the nature of the act, the probability of reformation, and the conduct in jail.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observes that the accused's conduct in prison has been satisfactory, with no disciplinary actions initiated against him. The report from the Jail Authorities indicates that he has been entrusted with various duties and has behaved well in prison.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court upholds the judgment of the High Court insofar as the conviction is concerned but modifies the sentence under Section 302 IPC from 30 years to 25 years imprisonment without remission. The court holds that this would serve the ends of justice.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the portrayal of persons with disabilities in visual media, specifically films. The court is considering an appeal regarding the Cinematograph Act and Rules, which aim to promote respectful and accurate portrayals of individuals with disabilities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
* Persons with disabilities are often misrepresented or stereotyped in visual media, perpetuating negative attitudes and stigma.
* The Cinematograph Act and Rules should be amended to ensure that films promoting positive and respectful portrayals of persons with disabilities are encouraged and recognized.
* The court should consider the importance of consultation with and involvement of persons with disabilities in the implementation of measures to promote positive portrayals.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that:
* The Cinematograph Act and Rules already provide for the promotion of positive portrayals of persons with disabilities through the requirement for films to encourage such portrayal.
* The court should not intervene in the creative freedom of filmmakers to depict individuals with disabilities as they see fit.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
* Visual media has a significant impact on public perceptions and attitudes towards persons with disabilities.
* There is a need for greater representation and accuracy in the portrayal of individuals with disabilities in films.
* Collaboration between disability advocacy groups, filmmakers, and decision-making bodies can provide valuable insights and guidance on respectful and accurate portrayals.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:
* Visual media has a responsibility to promote positive and respectful portrayals of persons with disabilities.
* Decision-making bodies must bear in mind the values of participation and involve persons with disabilities in assessing the overall message of films and their impact on dignity.
* Training and sensitization programs should be implemented for individuals involved in creating visual media content, including writers, directors, producers, and actors.
* The court dismissed the appeal but emphasized the importance of promoting positive portrayals of persons with disabilities in visual media.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a writ petition related to the accessibility of public spaces and services in India. The petitioner has submitted a report prepared by NALSAR-CDS, which includes recommendations for improving accessibility.
The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment had asked NALSAR-CDS to prepare the report using their own resources, without making any financial claims. 
The report was prepared after consulting 52 experts, receiving reports from 14 states and 3 Union Territories, and gathering over 100 reports from organizations and individual testimonies.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argues that the current legal framework is inadequate to ensure accessibility of public spaces and services in India. 
The report prepared by NALSAR-CDS highlights several recommendations for improving accessibility, including prioritizing universal design principles, comprehensive inclusion across disabilities, assistive technology integration, and ongoing stakeholder consultation.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court notes that the current Rule 15 does not contain a baseline of non-negotiable rules for accessibility. 
The report prepared by NALSAR-CDS provides valuable insights and recommendations for improving accessibility in India.
The court appreciates the effort and resources expended by NALSAR-CDS in preparing the report and directs the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to pay INR 50,00,000 as compensation for their work.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the Union Government to ensure that a baseline of non-negotiable rules is prescribed in Rule 15. 
The government must conduct this exercise in consultation with all stakeholders and NALSAR-CDS. 
Once the mandatory rules are prescribed, the consequences prescribed in Sections 44, 45, 46, and 89 of the RPWD Act must be implemented.

<FACTS>
The recruitment process commences from the issuance of an advertisement calling for applications and ends with filling up of vacancies. The eligibility criteria for being placed in the Select List, notified at the commencement of the recruitment process, cannot be changed midway through the recruitment process unless the extant Rules so permit, or the advertisement does not contradict the extant Rules.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The decision in K. Manjusree (supra) lays down good law and is not in conflict with the decision in Subash Chander Marwaha (supra). The two cases deal with different issues - one deals with the right to be placed in the Select List, while the other deals with the right to be appointed from the Select List.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Recruiting bodies may devise an appropriate procedure for bringing the recruitment process to its logical end provided the procedure so adopted is transparent, non-discriminatory/non-arbitrary and has a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved. Placement in the select list gives no indefeasible right to appointment.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
In terms of the answers rendered above, after obtaining administrative directions from Hon'ble the Chief Justice, let the appeals be placed before appropriate Bench for decision. The burden is on the State to justify its decision for not making appointment from the Select List if a challenge is laid to State's action in respect of denying appointment to a selected candidate.

</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the owner include:
- Section 36-C read with Section 51 of the NDPS Act allows for the application of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for proceedings under the NDPS Act.
- Section 451 CrPC has an inbuilt provision to impose specific conditions on the release of seized vehicles.
- Keeping the vehicle in police custody for a long period is not necessary and can be released on terms and conditions determined by the Special Court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- Vehicles stored in police custody are exposed to the open, which may cause damage or depreciation of value.
- Keeping the vehicle in custody will serve no purpose and will only result in loss to the owner.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
- The appeal is allowed with directions to the trial court to release the vehicle on superdari after preparing video and still photographs of the vehicle and obtaining necessary information/documents for identification.
- The appellant shall not sell or part with the ownership of the Vehicle till conclusion of the trial and shall furnish an undertaking to the trial court that he shall surrender the Vehicle within one week of being so directed and/or pay the value of the Vehicle (determined according to Income Tax law on the date of its release), if so ultimately directed by the Court.

<FACTS>
The case involves a medical student with a disability who was denied admission to the AIIMS, Nagpur due to an unfavorable report from the Disability Assessment Board. The student, through his counsel, challenged this decision in court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Arguments presented by the appellant (student) and respondents:
- Appellant: The Disability Assessment Board failed to apply the statutory and regulatory standards applicable to the assessment of a person with disability, resulting in an unfair report. The board should have considered reasonable accommodations for the student's disability.
- Respondents: The Disability Assessment Board followed proper procedures, and the appellant did not provide sufficient documentation to support his claim for special accommodations.

The court also notes that the existing guidelines for admitting persons with disabilities into medical courses need revision to comply with contemporary advancements in disability justice.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations made by the court:
- The Disability Assessment Boards should adopt a more inclusive and supportive approach when assessing candidates with disabilities, rather than relying solely on benchmark models that may not accurately reflect individual abilities.
- The inclusion of persons with disabilities in the medical profession can enhance healthcare quality and promote social equality, as mandated by Articles 21, 19, 14, and 15 of the Indian Constitution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's decision:
- Sets aside the impugned judgment of the Nagpur bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay for failing to apply statutory and regulatory standards in assessing the student with a disability.
- Orders AIIMS, Nagpur to allocate a supernumerary seat to the appellant, provided he has not secured admission elsewhere.
- Directs the college to extend accommodations as suggested in the report dated 20 October 2024.

- Orders the second respondent to issue fresh guidelines for admitting persons with disabilities into medical courses, including experts with disability or those conversant with disability rights.
- Directs the creation of a database with information on accessibility and reasonable accommodation at colleges.

The petitioners challenged the validity of certain provisions in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, specifically the Explanation(s) appended to Rule 38 of the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 2016, and Rule 45 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 2017. The challenge was regarding the cascading impact of royalty on royalty in the calculation of the 'average sale price'. The respondents were directed by the court to conduct a public consultation process for amending the Act.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that since the respondents are already aware of the anomaly in royalty calculation and policy is being reconsidered on grounds raised by petitioners, no further action was needed. However, it clarified that this decision would not preclude the petitioners from challenging any final policy decision taken after the completion of the ongoing consultation process.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court granted the respondents a period of 2 months to conclude the public consultation process and take a final decisive call on the matter. The challenge to the validity of certain provisions was accordingly answered, and the Registry was directed to notify the matter before an appropriate Bench after a period of two months from the date of pronouncement of this judgment.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Central Bank of India and another appellant (Appellants) were involved in several civil suits with Smt. Prabha Jain and others (Respondents). The Appellants had objected to the jurisdiction of the trial court, arguing that the Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) or the High Court should have exclusive jurisdiction over the matters.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act and Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) together empower the DRTs to pass orders for recovery. They also claimed that the High Court had already exercised its jurisdiction under Article 227 over similar matters, which would make it a binding precedent.
The Respondents, on the other hand, argued that the Appellants' objection to jurisdiction was misplaced because they were merely invoking the SARFAESI Act and not seeking any declaratory relief. They also claimed that the High Court's judgment in another matter (which is mentioned as a "binding" precedent by the Appellants) did not preclude the trial court from exercising its jurisdiction.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the Appellants' argument was based on an interpretation of Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act and Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC, which would give exclusive jurisdiction to the DRTs. However, this interpretation was not in accordance with the law as it stands today.
The court also noted that the Appellants' reliance on a High Court judgment as a "binding" precedent was misplaced because the facts and circumstances of each case are unique.
Additionally, the court suggested that the Appellants could have approached the DRTs or the High Court for relief under Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act instead of invoking the SARFAESI Act in the trial court.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals and vacated the interim orders passed by it. The court held that the Appellants had not demonstrated any error on the part of the High Court in passing the impugned order, which refused to stay the proceedings in the trial court.
The court also observed that Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act does not provide for exclusive jurisdiction to the DRTs but rather empowers them to pass orders for recovery. As a result, the Appellants' objection to jurisdiction was rejected.
The Supreme Court further directed that the civil suits should proceed expeditiously in accordance with law and vacated the interim order earlier granted by it.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent no. 1 bank had created an equitable mortgage over the property in question, but failed to bring this fact to the notice of the appellant bank.
The first charge was that of the Central Bank and not of the appellant bank.
An amount of Rs. 51 lakh is lying deposited with the DRT maintained in an escrow account.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent no. 1 bank argued that the transaction evidenced by the prior unregistered document is valid, but any title or interest created by it is liable to be defeated under the rule of priority by a valid later and legal sale or mortgage evidenced by a duly registered document.
The appellant bank argued that the respondent no. 1 bank had failed to bring the factum of its 'equitable mortgage' to the notice of the appellant bank, and therefore was not entitled to enforce the same qua the recovery proceeds of the appellant bank herein.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court got carried away by the fact that the first charge was that of the Central Bank and not of the appellant bank, and failed to notice the distinction that exists between an 'equitable mortgage' and a 'legal mortgage'.
The rule implies that the later registered title is intended to prevail against an earlier unregistered title.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court concluded that the impugned order passed by the High Court is not correct and it deserves to be set aside.
The appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned Order passed by the High Court is hereby set aside.
The respondent no. 1 bank is not entitled to enforce its 'equitable mortgage' qua the recovery proceeds of the appellant bank herein.
An amount of Rs. 51 lakh is lying deposited with the DRT maintained in an escrow account, which now be disbursed along with interest in favour of the appellant bank.

The case involves a man who was convicted of murdering his wife. The incident occurred in 1995, and the trial court convicted him in 1998. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but the substantive order was suspended, and he was released on bail. It took 16 years for the High Court to decide the appeal, which ultimately came to be dismissed on 23.05.2014.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's lawyer argued that the crime was committed in a fit of rage due to provocation from his wife, and therefore, it could not be classified as murder under Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The lawyer also pointed out that the High Court had wrongly convicted the appellant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that a fight suddenly takes place, for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. It might be that one of them starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct, it would not have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which attaches to each fighter.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that the High Court committed no error in affirming the judgment and order of conviction passed by the trial court, holding the appellant guilty of the offence of murder of his wife. The Court granted liberty to the appellant to prefer an appropriate representation addressed to the State Government praying for remission of sentence.

The Respondent moved the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate for action against the named public servant under section 4 of the Act of 1989 on 05.06.2018. The Metropolitan Magistrate called for an administrative enquiry report, which was not done. The Metropolitan Magistrate dismissed C.T. No. 536/2018.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants argued that the direction in the impugned judgment for penal prosecution is unsustainable and contrary to the proviso to section 4(2) of the Act of 1989, as no administrative enquiry report was called for before taking cognizance. The Respondent argued that the omission or commission by the public servants warrants penal action.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the purpose of an administrative inquiry is to find out the conduct of a public servant against whom allegations of failure of duty or function are made and the omission or commission is bonafide or willful. The Court noted that the impugned judgment, for all purposes, adjudicated the alleged dereliction of duty by the named public servants and directed penal prosecution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the direction in the impugned judgment for penal prosecution is unsustainable and contrary to the proviso to section 4(2) of the Act of 1989, as no administrative enquiry report was called for before taking cognizance. The Court allowed the Criminal Appeal and set aside the impugned judgment.

<FACTS>
The case involves the issue of whether the services rendered by lawyers can be considered as "services" under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) had allowed a complaint against a lawyer for deficiency in service, leading to an appeal being filed before the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant include:
* The consumer protection laws are meant to protect consumers from defective goods and services, not professionals like lawyers who have their own regulatory bodies.
* The Advocates Act, 1961 regulates the conduct of lawyers in India and is a complete code in itself, making it unnecessary for lawyers to be brought under the Consumer Protection Act.
* Including lawyers within the scope of consumer protection laws would undermine the independence of the legal profession and create uncertainty and finality of decision-making.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The legal profession is a regulated profession in India, and its working needs to be aligned with international practices.
* Consumer protection laws should have universal application and be confined to "consumers" only, excluding professional services like those of lawyers.
* Excluding professionals from consumer protection laws would prevent interference with the independence of the legal profession.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that:
* The legislature in India did not intend to include professional services, especially those of lawyers, within the purview of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and re-enacted in 2019.
* The NCDRC's view that a complaint under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 would be maintainable for deficiency in service rendered by lawyers is incorrect and stands overruled.
* The impugned order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission dated 06.08.2007 is hereby set aside.

Karikho Kri was elected as the returned candidate from 44 Tezu (ST) Assembly Constituency of the State of Arunachal Pradesh.
Nuney Tayang filed an election petition against Karikho Kri, alleging various grounds for invalidating his election under Sections 100(1)(b), 100(1)(d)(i), and 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951.
The High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Arunachal Pradesh held that sufficient grounds were made out to invalidate Karikho Kri's election under the aforementioned sections.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Nuney Tayang argued that Karikho Kri's nomination was improperly accepted under Section 100(1)(d)(i) of the Act of 1951.
Karikho Kri failed to disclose the dues of municipal/property taxes payable by him and his wife, which could be considered a non-disclosure under Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of the Act of 1951.
The High Court also held that non-disclosure of three vehicles registered in the names of Karikho Kri's wife and son constituted a "corrupt practice" under Section 123(2) of the Act of 1951.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court's conclusion was based on an analysis of the election petition and the evidence adduced by Nuney Tayang.
However, the Supreme Court held that the High Court erred in concluding that sufficient grounds were made out under Sections 100(1)(b), 100(1)(d)(i), and 100(1)(d)(iv) to invalidate Karikho Kri's election.
The Supreme Court also observed that Nuney Tayang failed to sufficiently plead or prove a specific breach or how it materially affected the result of the election under Section 100(1)(d)(iv).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
Civil Appeal No. 4615 of 2023 filed by Karikho Kri was allowed, setting aside the Judgment and Order dated 17.07.2023 passed by the Itanagar Bench of the High Court.
The election of Karikho Kri as the returned candidate from 44 Tezu (ST) Assembly Constituency of the State of Arunachal Pradesh was upheld.
Civil Appeal No. 4716 of 2023, filed by Nuney Tayang, was dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the appellants who were accused under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. The trial court convicted them, but the High Court set aside the conviction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' defense team argued that:
- The confessional statements made by the appellants to the empowered officers under Section 67 of the NDPS Act, 1985 are inadmissible as evidence against them because these officers do not have the power to investigate or file a police report.
- The bar under Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) 1872 is not applicable against the admissibility of confessional statements made to empowered officers under the NDPS Act, 1985.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations from the court include:
- The enquiry undertaken under the provisions mentioned can lead to initiation of an investigation or enquiry by the empowered officers either under Section 53 of the NDPS Act, 1985, or otherwise.
- Empowered officers do not have the power to investigate or file a police report and therefore their confessional statements cannot be considered as confession made to a police officer for the purpose of Section 25 of the IEA 1872.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that:
- The appeals are allowed, and the impugned judgments of the High Court and the Trial Court are set aside.
- The appellants are acquitted of the charges framed against them by giving benefit of doubt.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the denial of bail to an appellant in two separate cases - ED Case No. HIU-II/14/2022 registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and FIR No. RC0032022A0053 of 2022 registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The appellant is facing charges involving a large number of witnesses, thousands of pages of documents, and over a lakh pages of digitized documents.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the appellant's counsel include:
* The prolonged incarceration of the appellant is unreasonable and infringes upon his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.
* There is no possibility of the trial being concluded in the near future, and keeping the appellant behind bars would be unjust.
* The conditions for granting bail can be imposed to ensure the appellant's attendance at trial and prevent tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The case involves a large number of witnesses, documents, and digitized evidence, making it unlikely that the trial will be concluded soon.
* Prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty is not permitted to become punishment without trial.
* The objective of keeping a person in judicial custody pending trial or disposal of an appeal is to secure their attendance at trial.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment passed by the court is as follows:
* The appeals are allowed, and the impugned judgment and order are quashed and set aside.
* The appellant is directed to be released on bail in connection with both cases upon furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- with two sureties of the like amount.
* Additional conditions are imposed on the appellant, including surrendering his passport, reporting to the Investigating Officer on specific days, and refraining from influencing witnesses or tampering with evidence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a second complaint filed by the complainant after the first complaint was disposed of. The second complaint was filed on 20.07.2011, and it reproduces the first complaint dated 11.11.2010, stating that the said complaint was not properly investigated.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are as follows:

*   The High Court's decision that the second complaint was maintainable was challenged by the appellant.
*   The learned Sessions Judge and the High Court had interfered with the order passed by the learned CJM dated 12.07.2012, holding the second complaint as not maintainable in law.
*   The case relied on the decisions of Ravinder Singh v. Sukhbir Singh (2013) 9 SCC 245 and Samta Naidu's case (supra).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The key observations made by the court are:

*   The maintainability or otherwise of the second complaint would depend on how the earlier complaint happened to be rejected/dismissed at the first instance.
*   The case at hand stands on a firmer footing than the case involved in Samta Naidu's case (supra) as the core of both complaints is identical.
*   Repeated complaints by frustrated litigants cannot be maintained, and none of the situations permissible in terms of the decisions referred to supra exist in this case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:

*   The appeal was allowed, and the decision of the High Court dated 08.01.2021 and the decision of the learned Sessions Judge that got confirmation from the High Court were set aside.
*   The order of the learned CJM dated 12.07.2012 was restored, and the complaint dated 20.07.2011 stands rejected for not being maintainable.

The judgment relied on the principles laid down in Ravinder Singh v. Sukhbir Singh (2013) 9 SCC 245 and Samta Naidu's case (supra).
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the application of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 2015 (MMDRA). The main issue is whether MADA should be given prospective effect or retrospective effect. The court notes that the matter has been pending for over three decades since the decision in India Cement v. State of Tamil Nadu.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court considers several arguments:

* The submission that MADA (supra) should be given prospective effect is rejected by the court.
* The court argues that the demand of tax shall not operate on transactions made prior to 1 April 2005, and the time for payment of the demand of tax shall be staggered in instalments over a period of twelve years commencing from 1 April 2026.
* The court also states that the levy of interest and penalty on demands made for the period before 25 July 2024 shall stand waived for all the assesses.

Additionally, the court considers the following points:

* The delay in court proceedings should not be to the detriment of the assesses.
* Equities will be balanced if the State governments waive the outstanding interest accrued on the principal due from the assesses.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
* The total amount, including principal and interest, due by the assesses in the pending matters may be substantial compared to their total net worth.
* Steel Authority of India has stated that retrospective application of MADA (supra) will lead to revival of cumulative demands to the tune of approximately Rupees three thousand crores from different States.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court directs the following conditionalities:

a. While the States may levy or renew demands of tax, if any, pertaining to Entries 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule in terms of the law laid down in the decision in MADA (supra), the demand of tax shall not operate on transactions made prior to 1 April 2005.
b. The time for payment of the demand of tax shall be staggered in instalments over a period of twelve years commencing from 1 April 2026.
c. The levy of interest and penalty on demands made for the period before 25 July 2024 shall stand waived for all the assesses.

The court also notes that it is the prerogative of the State legislatures to determine whether to forego the dues for the period before 25 July 2024.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent no.1 had been granted bail by the High Court in connection with Crime 217/2019, registered with Police Station Kotwali, Nagpur. The charges included sections 409, 420, 467, 478, 471, and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, as well as Section 3 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act.
The respondent no.1 had already suffered incarceration for a period of about six months at the time when bail was granted.
Investigations revealed that the respondent no.1 was involved in a scam affecting a large number of people, and it was alleged that he had made investments out of Society funds.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court's decision to grant bail to the respondent no.1 was challenged by the appellant, who argued that the discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge of the High Court was not in tune with the principles that conventionally govern the exercise of such power.
The appellant also pointed out that though respondent no.1 had already suffered incarceration for a period of about six months at the time when bail was granted, his release on bail could seriously lead to dissipation of the properties where investments have allegedly been made out of Society funds.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
It was observed that in cases where allegations coupled with materials brought on record by the investigation and in the nature of economic offence affecting a large number of people reveal the active role of the accused seeking anticipatory or regular bail, it would be fit for the Court granting such bail to impose appropriately strict and additional conditions.
The High Court had imposed usual conditions simpliciter, which was not sufficient considering the nature of the alleged offence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal succeeds. The impugned order stands set aside. Respondent No.1 is directed to surrender within a period of three weeks from today, failing which the trial Court shall proceed in accordance with law.
The observations made hereinabove are limited to the aspect of testing the legality of the impugned order. They shall not be treated as definitive/conclusive regarding respondent no.1 or any other accused.
Given the peculiar circumstances, where bail is being cancelled after a period of almost 3 years, it is deemed appropriate to grant liberty to the respondent no.1 to apply for bail at a later period or in the event of a change in circumstances.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant has been incarcerated for 15 months or more for an offence punishable under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The trial of the scheduled offences and, consequently, the PMLA offence is not likely to be completed in three to four years or even more.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's influential position in the State may have resulted in a so-called compromise between the bribe givers and the bribe takers. Considering the apprehension of the appellant tampering with the evidence, stringent conditions must be imposed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
In this case, clean acquittal was granted to the accused after very long incarceration as an undertrial. When we say clean acquittal, we are excluding the cases where the witnesses have turned hostile or there is a bona fide defective investigation. In such cases of clean acquittal, crucial years in the life of the accused are lost.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed, and the appellant shall be enlarged on bail till the final disposal of CC No. 9 of 2023 pending before the Principal Session Judge, Chennai, subject to certain conditions:
a. The appellant shall furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs.25,00,000/-(Rupees twenty-five lakhs only) with two sureties in the like amount;
b. The appellant shall not directly or indirectly attempt to contact or communicate with the prosecution witnesses and victims of the three scheduled offences in any manner.
c-f. Other conditions related to attendance, surrender of passport, cooperation with courts, and cancellation of bail on frivolous grounds.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC at P.S. Jalna on March 25, 2013.
The appellants were charged with various offenses including domestic violence and causing harm to the complainant.
The charge sheet was filed on July 30, 2013, bearing Chargesheet No. 123/2013 in the above FIR.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had refused to quash the FIR and the charge sheet on the grounds that the appellants' petition for quashing of the FIR was untenable after the charge sheet has been filed.
However, the Supreme Court observed that there is no prohibition against quashing of the criminal proceedings even after the charge sheet has been filed.
The appellants argued that none of the ingredients of Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC are made out in the case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
None provided.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the present appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court in Criminal Application No. 4015 of 2014 dated May 05, 2017.
The FIR dated March 25, 2013, bearing Crime No. 81/2013 filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC at P.S. Jalna and the chargesheet dated July 30, 2013, bearing Chargesheet No. 123/2013 in the above FIR were quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The respondent raised an objection on the deficit stamp duty before the stage of admission of the instrument in evidence. The respondent required the suit agreement to be impounded and then sent to the District Registrar to be dealt with under Section 39 of the Act. The trial court called for a report from the District Registrar, so the suit instrument is still at one or the other steps summed up in paragraph 21.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The respondent desired the impounding of the suit agreement and collect the deficit stamp duty and penalty. The trial court has yet to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act. The imposition of penalty of ten times at this juncture in the facts and circumstances of this case is illegal and contrary to the steps summed up in paragraph 21.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The District Registrar, in exercise of his jurisdiction under Section 39 of the Act, decides the quantum of stamp duty and penalty payable on the instrument. The appellant is denied this option by the impugned orders. It is trite law that the appellant must pay what is due, but as decided by the District Registrar and not the Court under Section 34 of the Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The direction to pay ten times the penalty of the deficit stamp duty merits interference and accordingly is set aside. The trial court is directed to send the agreement of sale dated 29.06.1999 to the District Registrar to determine the deficit stamp duty and penalty payable. Upon receipt of the compliance certificate from the District Registrar, without reference to an objection under the Act, the suit document be received in evidence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a long-standing dispute over property rights in India. The parties involved are the appellant and the respondents, who were defendants in a partition suit filed by the plaintiffs (now referred to as "the first partition suit"). The issue at hand is related to objections raised by the appellant against the decree passed in the first partition suit.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court observed that the decree passed in the first partition suit could not have been decreed under the Punjab Pre-Emption Act, 1973. However, it noted that this was not a relevant aspect to consider, given that the entitlement of share is admitted by the parties.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court made several observations, including:
* The decree passed in the first partition suit could not have been decreed under the Punjab Pre-Emption Act, 1973 (though this was noted to be irrelevant).
* The discussion of pre-emption in the judgment rendered in the first partition suit appears to correspond to an earlier transaction having taken place somewhere in the 1930s and 1940s by one Lal Singh, father of the plaintiffs.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals to the extent that the matter was remanded to the First Appellate Court to take a decision on the objections of the appellant afresh, on merits. The court clarified that it had not expressed any view on the facts of the case.
Key points from the judgment include:
* The case has been pending for over two decades and the Supreme Court requests the concerned Court to take all steps necessary for expeditious disposal.
* The court directed the Registry to forward a copy of this judgment to the learned Registrar General of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana, who shall then ensure its passage to the concerned Court, expeditiously.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The Appellants, including a Member of Parliament, were summoned by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) under Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED alleged that the Appellants were involved in money laundering and had received Rs. 168 Crores from co-accused Anup Majee to be delivered to their political bosses. The offense was allegedly committed in Delhi, which gave the ED territorial jurisdiction.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Appellants challenged the summons on the grounds that:
1. The ED did not have territorial jurisdiction over the case, as the offense was allegedly committed outside of Delhi.
2. The summons were issued under Section 50 of the PMLA, which is a non-judicial proceeding and does not provide adequate safeguards for the Appellants' rights.
3. The Appellant No. 2 did not produce documents as required by the summons and had challenged the Order taking cognizance of the complaint filed against her under Section 63 PMLA r/w Section 174 IPC in a separate High Court writ petition (Crl. M.C. No. 2442 of 2021).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
1. The ED had established adequate nexus between the offense and the offenders with the territory of Delhi.
2. The Appellant No. 1 has an official residence in Delhi, which further supported the ED's territorial jurisdiction.
3. The Appellants' challenge to the summons was devoid of merit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court dismissed both Appeals as being devoid of merits and held that:
1. The ED had valid territorial jurisdiction over the case.
2. The Appellants were bound to attend in person or through authorized agents as directed by the officer and state the truth upon any subject respecting which they are examined or make statements, and produce documents as may be required under Section 50 of the PMLA.
3. The proceedings under Section 50 are deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the interpretation of Section 29A(4) and (5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The facts of the case are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but it seems to be a legal discussion on the maintainability of an application for extension of time period for passing an arbitral award.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case include:
* An argument that an application for extension of time period is not maintainable after the expiry of the twelve-month or extended six-month period as provided under Section 29A(4) and (5).
* A counter-argument that an application for extension can be made even after the expiry of the specified periods, as long as sufficient cause is shown.
* An argument that the court has the power to extend time period for making of the award under sub-section (5), and not with the arbitral tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations presented in the case include:
* The importance of giving meaningful life to an enactment or rule, avoiding cadaveric consequences that result in unworkable or impracticable scenarios.
* The principle of sufficient cause should guide the court while adjudicating extension applications.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:
* The court holds that an application for extension of time period for passing an arbitral award under Section 29A(4) read with Section 29A(5) is maintainable even after the expiry of the twelve-month or extended six-month period.
* The court will be guided by the principle of sufficient cause and observations in paragraph 15 while adjudicating extension applications.
* The appeals are directed to be listed for final hearing and disposal in a specified week.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute over land ownership and the validity of court decrees. The High Court had passed an order dated 27th April, 2022, which was set aside by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the High Court exceeded its review and contempt jurisdiction. The order related to the title to a piece of land, the validity of decrees in favor of respondents, and other contentious issues.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the appellants (petitioners) argued that the High Court's order dated 27th April, 2022, was incorrect and should be set aside, while the respondents may have argued in support of the High Court's decision.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the Supreme Court are as follows:
- The writ court is a court of equity, and parties must approach it with clean hands.
- Suppression of material facts can be considered fraud on the court.
- A point of fraud can be raised even collaterally if the facts warrant it.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court's judgment is as follows:
- The High Court exceeded its review and contempt jurisdiction, leading to the setting aside of its order dated 27th April, 2022.
- The judgment and order of the Division Bench (original) in the contempt appeal and the Letters Patent Appeal are restored.
- The appeals succeed and are allowed. All pending applications stand disposed of.
- Parties shall bear their own costs.
- Determination of title to the subject land, adjudication on the validity of decrees, or decision on other contentious issues are left open for a competent forum to address if approached by any party.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a land acquisition process under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The respondents filed objections under Section 5A of the 1894 Act, which were later dismissed by the Collector. The High Court upheld the decision, and the appeals were filed before the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are as follows:
* The respondents argued that the Collector failed to comply with the procedure mandated by Section 5A of the 1894 Act, which led to the dismissal of their objections.
* The appellants (the state government) contended that the Collector's decision was justified and that the High Court's judgment upholding it was correct.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The following observations were made by the court:
* The court noted that while the Collector's decision may have been technically correct, there were procedural irregularities in the land acquisition process.
* The court observed that the 2013 Act came into force during the pendency of the land acquisition process and that the respondents should be entitled to compensation under the new law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals, set aside the High Court's judgment, and dismissed the writ petitions filed by the respondents. The court ordered the payment of compensation to the respondents and other landowners along with interest at the statutory rate within 4 weeks. The court also clarified that the respondents are entitled to seek further enhancement in compensation under the 2013 Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a dispute between the respondent (customs authority) and the appellant regarding customs duty on imported goods. The 304 cases of goods were found within the notified public bonded warehouse, but 264 cases of goods were removed from the warehouse without permission. The respondent demanded customs duty and interest on all 304 cases.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the appellant argued against the demand for customs duty and interest on the 264 cases of goods removed from the warehouse without permission. The respondent likely argued that the entire 304 cases were subject to customs duty as they remained within the notified public bonded warehouse beyond the permitted period.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The warehousing in the notified public bonded warehouse continued, as evidenced by the deposit made by the corporation with the respondent for custom establishment charges from 1992-1993 to 2007-2008. This observation suggests that the issue is not about the extension of the warehousing period but rather about the unauthorized removal of goods.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal in part and set aside the demand raised by the respondent against the appellant for customs duty and interest on the 264 cases of goods. The parties were directed to work out their remedies under Section 15(1)(c) of the Customs Act within eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the order. However, the demand for customs duty and interest on the 27 cases was sustained. The penalty imposed on the appellant under Section 112 of the Customs Act was also not disturbed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal for bail. The appellant was in custody for five years and the trial was already underway with 22 witnesses, including protected witnesses, examined.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court emphasized that the right to life and personal liberty enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution is overarching and sacrosanct. The court noted that a constitutional court cannot be restrained from granting bail to an accused on account of restrictive statutory provisions in a penal statute if it finds that the right of the accused-undertrial under Article 21 has been infringed.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court distinguished K.A. Najeeb (supra) and Gurwinder Singh (supra), noting that while delay in trial pertaining to grave offences cannot be used as a ground to grant bail, the facts of each case are unique. The court also emphasized that mere delay in trial is not sufficient grounds for denying bail.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court granted bail to the appellant, setting aside and quashing the impugned order dated 03.04.2023 of the High Court. The conditions for bail were:
- Trial court shall impound the passport and/or citizenship document(s) of the appellant.
- Appellant shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; he shall furnish his address to the trial court.
- He shall appear before the trial court on each and every date of the trial.
- In addition to the above, the appellant shall mark his attendance before the police station which the trial court may indicate once in every fortnight till conclusion of the trial.
- He shall not tamper with the evidence and shall not threaten the witnesses.
If there is any violation of the bail conditions, it would be open to the prosecution to move the trial court for cancellation of bail.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the order of the Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge (CBI) and the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. The appellant, who lost his money, lodged a complaint based on information furnished by his employee, Ram Kishore, who was under police custody in the Police Station. The case revolves around allegations of custodial death amounting to murder.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the appeal include:
* Absence of prima facie case revealed from the materials produced by the prosecution
* Failure of the High Court to consider the matter in the manner required under law, given the facts and circumstances of the case
* The appellant's role as a victim who lost his money and lodged a complaint based on information furnished by his employee
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made in the judgment include:
* The mere fact that rejection of the application for discharge is concurrent cannot be a reason for confirming the impugned order of the High Court
* The final report dated 21.02.2000 filed in Crime No.371/1993 reveals that Ram Kishore was under the control of the police in the Police Station
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment is as follows:
* The appeal is allowed, and the order and judgment passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad are set aside
* The application filed by the appellant under Section 227, Cr.PC, dated 04.04.2007 for discharge in Crime No.351/1993 is allowed, and the appellant stands discharged
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves appeals related to the framing of charges against accused persons in a corruption case. The trial has been pending for nearly 25 years. The appellants sought discharge on the grounds that there was no sufficient material to frame charges and that certain documents, including an order from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, were relevant to their defense.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that:
* There was no sufficient material to frame charges against them.
* Certain documents, including an order from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, were relevant to their defense and should be considered.
* The Income Tax proceedings were not relevant to the corruption case.
* One of the accused persons, Puneet Sabharwal, was a minor during part of the check period, which should be taken into consideration.

The respondents (prosecution) argued that:
* Even if there is only a strong suspicion founded on material on record, it would justify the framing of charges against an accused person.
* The court should not blindly accept the decision of the prosecution but should consider whether the material warrants the framing of charge.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
* The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal order is a document that has emerged subsequent to the framing of charges and cannot be taken into consideration.
* The trial should be expeditiously concluded and, in any case, on or before December 31, 2024.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of the court is:
* No merit was found in the appeals, and they were dismissed.
* The interim orders stand vacated.
* All pending applications stand closed.
* The trial should be expeditiously concluded on or before December 31, 2024.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the Appellant against his conviction and sentence. The incident occurred a day after the recording of the statement by the Investigating Officer, who stated that Tularam was conscious and capable of making the declaration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the statement made by Tularam to the Investigating Officer was a dying declaration, which is admissible as evidence. The Appellant's defense team claimed that the medical report did not mention that Tularam's condition was serious, and that there were contradictions in the prosecution case.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observed that the requirement for a doctor's certification of mental fitness is a matter of prudence, and that the voluntary and truthful nature of the declaration can be established otherwise. The Court also noted that the medical opinion cannot override the affirmation by an eyewitness that the deceased was conscious and capable of making the declaration.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that the statement made by Tularam to the Investigating Officer was a dying declaration, which is admissible as evidence. The Court also observed that the mere non-obtainment of a medical fitness certificate will not deter it from considering a properly recorded statement under Section 161 CrPC to be a dying declaration. Finally, the Court dismissed the appeal and directed the Appellant to surrender and undergo the remainder of his sentence.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an eviction proceeding under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971. The first appellant is a public authority, and the respondents are unauthorised occupants of its premises. The Inquiry Officer was appointed to conduct the inquiry proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the case. However, it can be inferred that the respondents may have argued against the eviction proceeding on various grounds, such as lack of regulations under section 105H of the Act or bias of the Inquiry Officer.

The appellants may have argued that the Inquiry Officer is an independent quasi-judicial authority and has the power to conduct the proceedings despite the absence of regulations.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court had already rendered a finding on the issue of the Inquiry Officer's independence, holding that he is an independent quasi-judicial officer under the Act.

The Court also observed that mere non-framing of regulations would not entitle the respondents to keep the proceedings in abeyance. The provision in section 105H of the Act states that the Commissioner "may" make regulations for taking possession of premises, which implies that it is discretionary.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court held that even in the absence of regulations being framed under section 105H of the Act, the proceedings for eviction can be continued by the Inquiry Officer by adhering to principles of natural justice.

The High Court's order entertaining writ petitions which were not maintainable in the form they were presented was set aside. The civil appeals stand allowed, and the Inquiry Officer is directed to allow both parties to lead evidence and raise whatever points are available in defence.

The Inquiry Officer is encouraged to proceed with expedition.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the criminal proceedings pending against the appellant before the CJM, Varanasi. The charges are under Sections 353 and 186 of the IPC. The High Court had taken a prima facie view that the offenses were made out against the applicant, but the order did not address the issues discussed in this appeal.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that the CJM, Varanasi, took cognizance of the offenses without following the due process contemplated under the provisions of law. The High Court's decision to take a prima facie view was based on disputed questions of fact, which cannot be adjudicated by the court at that stage.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The dismissal in limine of the Special Leave Petition (SLP) by this Court does not constitute any declaration of law or a binding precedent. The High Court's decision was based on prima facie views, which cannot be used as a basis for quashing criminal proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court allowed the appeal and quashed Case No. 9790 of 2015 arising out of Case Crime No. 290 of 2015 under Sections 353 and 186 of the IPC, pending before the CJM, Varanasi. The consequent orders passed by the CJM, Varanasi in taking cognizance and issuing summon to the appellant were also set aside.

An application filed by the appellant-husband under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India sought dissolution of marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
Criminal cases/DV Act complaints and civil cases pending between the respondent and the appellant and his family members were to be closed.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court relied on principles of natural justice and held that impounding a passport without an opportunity to be heard is illegal.
The judgment cited Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P., which stated that issuance of 'Red Corner Notice' or impounding of passports for persons residing out of India should not be routine.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judgments/orders dated 15th September, 2022 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, Howrah and 25th January, 2023 passed by the High Court were quashed and set aside.
The marriage between the appellant and respondent was dissolved on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appeal concerns an arbitration agreement under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (ACA). The appellant filed a notice invoking arbitration against respondent nos. 1 to 3, seeking relief for alleged breaches of contract. Respondent nos. 2 and 3 were not signatories to the original agreement but had performed contractual obligations under it. An application was made under Section 11 of the ACA for the appointment of an arbitrator, but the High Court of Delhi refused to refer respondent nos. 2 and 3 to arbitration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that merely because a notice invoking arbitration was not issued to respondent nos. 2 and 3 does not denude the arbitral tribunal of its jurisdiction to implead them as parties during the arbitral proceedings. The purpose of an application under Section 11 is for the court to appoint an arbitrator, enabling dispute resolution through arbitration when the appointment procedure in the agreement fails.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that respondent nos. 2 and 3 had consented to perform contractual obligations under the LLP Agreement, indicating their agreement to be bound by the arbitration clause contained in Clause 40 of the Agreement. The court noted that merely because a court does not refer a certain party to arbitration in its order does not denude the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal from impleading them during the arbitral proceedings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court of Delhi dated 08.07.2024 in Arb. A. (Comm.) 24/2024. The court directed that respondent nos. 2 and 3 be impleaded as parties before the arbitral tribunal, and the proceedings must be continued from the stage of the arbitral tribunal's order dated 15.02.2024. The court also requested the arbitral tribunal to complete the hearings and pass its award as expeditiously as possible.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The case pertains to a complaint filed before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi. The complainants alleged that various banks had charged excessive interest rates on credit card transactions, which was unfair and constituted an unfair trade practice. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened in the matter, stating that it had issued directives to banks regarding interest rates, and there was no evidence to suggest that any bank had acted contrary to these directives.
</Facts>

<Arguments>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are as follows:
- The complainants argued that the charging of excessive interest rates by banks constituted an unfair trade practice and was in contravention of the RBI's directives.
- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) submitted that it had issued guidelines to banks regarding interest rates, and there was no evidence to suggest that any bank had acted contrary to these guidelines.
- The banks argued that they were merely following the RBI's directives and that the complainants were aware of the terms and conditions of their credit card transactions, including the interest rates applicable.
</Arguments>

<Observations>
The observations made by the court are as follows:
- The court noted that the RBI had issued guidelines to banks regarding interest rates and that there was no evidence to suggest that any bank had acted contrary to these guidelines.
- The court observed that the complainants were aware of the terms and conditions of their credit card transactions, including the interest rates applicable.
- The court also noted that the charging of interest rates by banks was a normal business practice and did not constitute an unfair trade practice in itself.
</Observations>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment delivered by the court is as follows:
- The appeals filed by various parties were allowed, and the final Judgment/Order dated 07.07.2008 passed by the National Commission in "Awaz & Ors. Vs Reserve Bank of India" was set aside.
- No order was made regarding costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant had a dispute that was settled amicably, and he paid approximately Rs. 5 lakhs in court fees. The matter was referred to mediation under Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), and it was disposed of through this process.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court held that the appellant is not entitled to a refund of the entire amount of court fees, as Lok Adalat and mediation are distinct methods of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). The High Court also observed that the State legislature had introduced Section 16A in the Maharashtra Court-fees Act, which allows for a complete refund of court fees in cases where the matter is disposed of through ADR.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observation made by the High Court was that it would be beneficial to do away with the differences in court fees between Lok Adalat and other forms of ADR to promote their use among the public. The State legislature has indeed amended the Maharashtra Court-fees Act, introducing Section 16A, which provides for a complete refund of court fees in cases where the matter is disposed of through ADR.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court held that this appeal lacks merit and is liable to be dismissed. However, considering the facts of the case and the amount involved (approximately Rs. 5 lakhs), the Court exercised its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution and granted a refund of the said amount.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a wife, Reena, who applied for maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. against her husband, Dinesh. The couple was granted a decree for restitution of conjugal rights by the court in 2022. However, despite this, Reena refused to return to her matrimonial home. The case revolves around whether Reena is entitled to maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' argument was that despite being granted a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, Reena's refusal to live with Dinesh disqualified her from receiving maintenance under Section 125(4) Cr.P.C. The respondents argued that the disqualification did not apply in this case as Reena had just cause to refuse to return to her matrimonial home due to the ill-treatment she suffered at the hands of her husband.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the restitution decree was passed on 23.04.2022, but there was no attempt made at reconciliation after 2017. Furthermore, Dinesh did not seek execution of the decree or a decree of divorce under Section 13(1A)(ii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court also noted that Dinesh sought to protect himself from a claim by Reena for maintenance by projecting the disobeyed restitution decree as a defence.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment passed by the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi in Criminal Revision No. 440 of 2022. The court restored the order dated 15.02.2022 passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Dhanbad, in Original Maintenance Case No. 454 of 2019. It was held that Reena was entitled to maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C., and Dinesh shall pay maintenance @ ₹10,000/- per month to Reena on or before the 10th day of each calendar month.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a matter that went to the High Court in revision. The High Court, by the impugned judgment and order, refused to interfere with an earlier order dated 30th May 2008 passed by the Special Judge. This order was stayed by the Supreme Court vide order dated 26th October 2010.
The matter involved a challenge to a judgment and order of conviction/acquittal dated 22nd/24th February 2007, which was later appealed against. The Special Judge had observed that this judgment and order had not been challenged and had become final, indicating a total non-application of mind.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Information not available
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The learned Special Judge had acted in a predetermined manner when passing the order dated 30th May 2008. This was evident from the observation that the judgment and order of conviction/acquittal dated 22nd/24th February 2007 had not been challenged and had become final, despite an appeal being admitted against it.
The Supreme Court noted that this reflected a total non-application of mind by the Special Judge when passing the order.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed and set aside the judgment and order dated 14th October 2010 passed by the High Court in Criminal Revision No. 2194 of 2008, and also quashed and set aside the observations made by the learned Special Judge in paragraphs 49 and 50 of the judgment and order of conviction/acquittal dated 22nd/24th February 2007.
The Supreme Court further ordered that the notice issued by the learned Special Judge dated 26th February 2007 to the appellant under Section 58 of the NDPS Act and all subsequent proceedings, including the order dictated and typed on 30th May 2008 by the learned Special Judge, shall stand quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant has undergone more than 14 years and 10 months of actual incarceration. The contention is that his case should be considered by the provision/policy in vogue at the time of his conviction, if not, a more beneficial policy could be applied.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the arguments presented were in favor of the appellant's claim for premature release, citing the length of his incarceration and the need to consider him under the provision/policy in vogue at the time of conviction or a more beneficial policy.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court observes that the decision to grant remission must be well-informed, reasonable, and fair to all concerned. The conditions imposed while exercising the power to grant remission must be reasonable, and arbitrary conditions may violate the convict's rights under Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court gives liberty to the appellant to apply afresh with a detailed representation justifying his claim to be considered for premature release accounting for his actual incarceration of over 14 years and with remission included, of over 20 years. Upon such representation being filed, the State Government shall pass a reasoned order expeditiously and latest within 3 months from the date of filing such representation.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute between the plaintiff and defendants regarding a contract for the sale of immovable property. The contract stipulates that 10% of the total sale consideration is to be paid immediately, 85% by February 28th, and the balance 5% at the time of notice for possession. The contract also specifies that possession of the suit property is to be handed over by the defendants to the plaintiff upon payment of the balance 5% of the total sale consideration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented in the case are centered around whether the transfer of possession of the immovable property is implicit in the contract, and thus covered under Section 16(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), or if a specific prayer seeking transfer of possession is required. The plaintiff's argument is that the stipulation for handing over possession upon payment of the balance 5% is sufficient to cover the transfer of possession.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that the handing over of possession of the immovable property in respect of which a decree of specific performance has been granted is only incidental, as held in Babu Lal (supra). The court also notes that the inclusion or absence of a prayer for transfer of possession does not determine the true nature of the suit.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment states that the Special Leave Petitions fail and are hereby dismissed. The interim relief granted earlier stands vacated. It is now for the plaintiff to take appropriate steps to present the plaint before the court of competent jurisdiction and get his suit adjudicated on merits in accordance with law.

<FACTS>
The respondent-accused was convicted for an offense against a minor female, 'V'. The accused had allegedly caused injuries to the private part of the victim. The prosecution's evidence included the testimony of PW-14 and medical evidence.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The defense suggested that the injury could not have been caused by a nail or an all-pin. However, this was contradicted by the doctor's findings, which indicated that the cause of the injury could be through sexual intercourse or an accident. The accused also attempted to discredit the evidence by suggesting that the doctor had given his findings influenced by a bribe, but this was unsubstantiated.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that there was no material contradiction in the witness's statement and that the discrepancy between the FIR and the deposition in Court was not sufficient to discredit the prosecution case. The court also noted that other evidence, including medical evidence, supported the prosecution's case.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The judgment of acquittal entered by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench, Jaipur, was set aside, and the judgment of conviction returned by the Sessions Judge, Tonk, was restored. The respondent-accused was directed to surrender before the competent authority within four weeks from the date of this judgment to serve out the sentence as awarded by the learned Trial Court.

<FACTS>
The case revolves around the applicability of a writ petition against orders/awards passed by MSEFC (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Facilitation Council) under the MSMED Act. The MSEFC functions as an arbitral tribunal in conciliation proceedings.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
Several previous judgments are cited to support the interpretation that:

1. A writ petition against orders/awards of MSEFC can be entertained if there is extreme hardship or exceptional circumstances, despite the availability of alternative remedies.

2. The MSEFC's role as a conciliator does not bar the maintainability of a writ petition before the High Court.

3. Section 18 of the MSMED Act and Section 80 of the A&C Act should be interpreted to determine whether MSEFC members who undertake conciliation proceedings can act as arbitrators in the arbitral tribunal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The judgments analyzed reveal a divergence of opinion on when and under what circumstances the principle of adequate alternative remedy does not apply. It is suggested that previous cases, such as Shyam Kishore (supra) and Govind Parameswar Nair (supra), provide some support for considering exceptional hardship or extreme situations.

The current case presents questions to be referred to a larger Bench of five Judges:
(i) Whether the ratio in M/s India Glycols Limited completely bars or prohibits maintainability of writ petitions against MSEFC orders/awards.
(ii) When and under what circumstances the principle/restriction of adequate alternative remedy will not apply.
(iii) Whether MSEFC members can act as arbitrators upon failure of conciliation proceedings.

The Registry is directed to place the papers before the Chief Justice for an appropriate decision on the constitution of a larger Bench.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The CJI (Sanjiv Khanna), along with JJ Sanjay Kumar and Manmohan, has directed the Registry to place the papers before the Chief Justice so that an appropriate decision can be taken on the administrative side for the constitution of a larger Bench in the present case. The questions raised in the appeal are referred to a larger Bench of five Judges.

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal against the registration of an FIR (First Information Report) filed under sections 336, 447, and 448 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by the Director of Deogarh Airport. The FIR was registered against several individuals who were on board an aircraft that allegedly entered the airport without permission.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the Aircraft Act, 1934, is a complete code dealing with the safety and security of civil aviation and aerodromes, and that no case can be made out against them under sections 336, 447, and 448 IPC. They also contended that only an authorized officer under the Aircraft Act, 1934 can take cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that no allegations of forcible entry or intimidation were made by any officials of ATC (Air Traffic Control), and that the Director of Deogarh Airport has been arrayed as an accused in the FIR. The court also noted that the Aircraft Act, 1934, prescribes a special procedure for taking cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that no case is made out against the respondents-accused persons under sections 336, 447, and 448 IPC. The court also observed that the Aircraft Act, 1934, is a complete code dealing with the safety and security of civil aviation and aerodromes, and that only an authorized officer under this Act can take cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act. Consequently, the present appeals are dismissed with liberty to the Appellate-State of Jharkhand to forward the material collected by it during investigation to such authorized officer under the Aircraft Act, 1934.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a composite suit filed for cancellation of a Sale Deed and recovery of possession. The plaintiff sought to get the Sale Deed set aside on various grounds.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The plaintiff's counsel argued that the suit was filed within the period of twelve years, considering both the substantive relief (cancellation of the sale deed) and consequential relief (recovery of possession).
However, the defendants' counsel contended that the limitation period for cancellation of the Sale Deed is three years from the date of knowledge of the sale deed sought to be cancelled.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that when a composite suit is filed for both cancellation of a Sale Deed and recovery of possession, the limitation period should be considered with respect to the substantive relief (cancellation of the Sale Deed).
The court noted that in this case, the plaintiff was seeking to regain his title over the suit property by setting aside the sale deed, which suggests that the title had already been lost.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that the limitation period for cancellation of a Sale Deed is three years from the date of knowledge of the sale deed sought to be cancelled. Since the plaintiff's suit was filed beyond this period, it was barred by limitation and should have been dismissed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an arbitration petition filed by the appellant against respondents 1 and 2. The dispute arose from transactions undertaken in respondent no. 2's account, for which respondent no. 1 was held jointly and severally liable. The arbitral tribunal had awarded Rs. 1,18,48,069/- along with 9% interest p.a. from 01.05.2001 till date of repayment to the appellant.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the context and the discussion, it can be inferred that the following arguments were made:

* The respondent argued that the adjustment of accounts was illegal and against the SEBI Guidelines and BSE Bye-laws.
* The appellant argued that the adjustment of accounts was legal and valid as per the SEBI Guidelines and BSE Bye-laws, specifically citing Bye-law 227(a) and 248(a).
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court are:

* The arbitral tribunal had the jurisdiction to exercise over respondent no. 1 based on an oral contract that he would be jointly and severally liable for the transactions undertaken in respondent no. 2's account.
* The High Court did not correctly exercise jurisdiction under Section 37 as it reappreciated evidence and examined the merits of the award, which was not permissible.
* The arbitral award does not suffer from patent illegality that warrants interference with its findings.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is:

* The impugned order of the High Court in Appeal No. 126/2006 in Arbitration Petition 309/2004 dated 29.04.2021 is set aside.
* The arbitral award dated 26.02.2004 is upheld in its entirety.
* Respondent no. 1 is jointly and severally liable, along with respondent no. 2, to pay the appellant the arbitral sum of Rs. 1,18,48,069/- along with 9% interest p.a. from 01.05.2001 till date of repayment as directed by the arbitral tribunal.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute related to the registration of a sale deed. The parties involved are the appellants (buyers) and the respondents (sellers). The sale deed was registered in 1985, and the buyers claimed that it was not properly registered. The sellers contended that the sale deed was validly registered.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The buyers argued that the sale deed did not contain the signatures of the mother of one of the sellers, which is a mandatory requirement under the law. They also argued that the passport size photograph and thumb impression were not affixed along with proof of identification, as required by law.
The sellers relied on various judgments to argue that the sale deed was properly registered. They contended that prior to 2001, there was no requirement for the vendee (buyer) to sign the document of sale or affix a passport size photograph and thumb impression along with proof of identification.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the cases relied upon by the sellers were distinguishable on facts from the present case. The court also noted that prior to 2001, there was no requirement under law for the vendee to sign the document of sale or affix a passport size photograph and thumb impression along with proof of identification.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court. It restored and maintained the judgment of the first Appellate Court, decreeing the suit of the buyers against the sellers. The court also imposed exemplary costs on the defendants, totaling Rs. 10,00,000 (Rupees ten lakhs only) to be paid to the buyers within eight weeks from the date of the order.

<FACTS>
The petitioner, Mohd. Tahir Hussain, sought interim bail in a criminal case pending before the Trial Court. The main issue was whether the petitioner should be granted interim bail to contest elections.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's counsel argued that granting interim bail would not prejudice either side and would allow the petitioner to participate in the electoral process.
The respondent (State of NCT of Delhi) opposed the grant of interim bail, citing concerns that others might misuse this judgment to seek release for election purposes.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
A special leave petition was filed by the petitioner, which was disposed of by modifying the impugned judgment pro tanto. The court noted that the grant of interim bail was specific to this case and not a conclusive opinion on the merits of the underlying bail application or main case.
The court inserted a caveat stating that this judgment has been passed in facts and circumstances specific to this case, and any litigant citing this in a later case would need to examine it on its own merits and factual prism.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court granted interim bail to the petitioner, subject to certain conditions. The court also emphasized that this judgment is specific to this case and not a precedent for future cases.
The court disposed of the special leave petition (Criminal) No. 856/2025, modifying the impugned judgment pro tanto.

- The counsel relied on various judgments of the Supreme Court, including State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy, to argue that the High Court's inherent powers could be exercised to quash the proceedings if it was in the interest of justice.
- The appellant's counsel also argued that the complaint was filed with a view to harass and persecute the appellant, and that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the process of the court.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The observations made by the court include:
- The court noted that the sum total of the circumstances, submissions, and documents on record did not point to the appellant having committed any offence against the complainant.

<FACTS>
The petitioner filed a writ petition against the Respondent No.5, who is the nodal agency responsible for implementing guidelines for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in writing their examinations. The petitioner sought directions to extend the benefits of the guidelines to all PwD candidates, not just those with writing disabilities.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner argued that the fundamental rights under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution can be claimed against private entities, as held in the case of Vikash Kumar. The petitioner also relied on the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPwD), 2016.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the guidelines issued by Respondent No.5 are applicable to all authorities and recruitment agencies, and that the benefits conferred by the statute should be provided to all PwD candidates.

(ix) Sensitize and train personnel on reasonable accommodation needs of PwDs.
(x) Ensure strict compliance of judgments in Vikash Kumar and Avni Prakash as well as provisions of RPwD Act, 2016.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves an appeal by the appellant who was convicted and sentenced to death. The High Court later acquitted him, directing a reinvestigation by a different investigation agency.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court discussed three conditions for the application of Article 20(2) of the Constitution: 
1. Previous proceedings before a competent court or judicial tribunal with valid prosecution.
2. Conviction or acquittal in force at the time of the second proceeding, related to the same offence and facts.
3. The subsequent proceeding must be fresh, not a retrial.

The court applied these conditions to the case and found that all three were met: 
- Previous proceedings took place with competent jurisdiction.
- Acquittal by the High Court was in force at the time of the second proceeding (reinvestigation).
- Although the order for reinvestigation would normally indicate a fresh start, it was deemed sufficient because the first investigation had already been conducted.

</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court recognized that the principle of double jeopardy is enshrined in Article 20(2) and Section 300 of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, they noted that the High Court's vision was "bad in law" and set aside all subsequent proceedings.
The court further observed that the appellant stands acquitted of all charges due to the violation of his right under Article 20(2).
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
This Court is of the view that the right enshrined in Article 20(2) of the appellant stands violated. The appeal is allowed, and the High Court's vision is quashed and set aside.

All proceedings subsequent to the direction for reinvestigation are necessarily held as such and therefore quashed and set aside as well. The appellant stands acquitted of all charges.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the entitlement of a spouse to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse when their marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court is considering two main questions:
(i) Whether a spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the 1955 Act.
(ii) Even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act, can the court grant maintenance pendente lite provided the conditions mentioned in Section 24 are satisfied.

The court considers examples where a wife induces another man to marry her while her first marriage subsists, and a daughter getting married to her father. It emphasizes that the grant of relief under Section 25 is discretionary.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The arguments presented by the parties involved are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the court is considering the following points:
- The entitlement of a spouse to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse when their marriage has been declared void.
- The discretionary nature of the grant of relief under Section 25 and Section 24.
- The conditions for applicability of Section 24, including pending proceedings under the 1955 Act and the spouse's lack of independent income.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that:
- The conduct of the parties must be considered when deciding the prayer for maintenance under Section 25.
- Equitable considerations do apply when the Court considers the prayer for maintenance under Section 25.
- Sub-section 1 of Section 25 uses the word "may," indicating a discretionary grant of relief.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court's judgment is as follows:
(a) A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of the 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the 1955 Act. However, whether such a relief can be granted depends on the facts of each case and the conduct of the parties.
(b) Even if a court comes to a prima facie conclusion that the marriage between the parties is void or voidable, pending the final disposal of the proceeding under the 1955 Act, the court is not precluded from granting maintenance pendente lite provided the conditions mentioned in Section 24 are satisfied.

The Registry is directed to place these appeals before the appropriate Bench for decision on merits.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellants were involved in a peaceful protest and pamphleteering, which was not offensive or abusive. They did not cross the Lakshman Rekha and transgress into the offending zone.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants' peaceful protest and pamphleteering are protected by Article 19(1)(a), (b), and (c) of the Constitution of India. The criminal proceedings against them would be an abuse of process if allowed to continue.
Peaceful pamphleteering is a form of communication protected by the first amendment in the United States, as seen in Organization for A Better Austin vs. Jerome M. Keefe. Similarly, consumer organizations have access to consumers via advertising, and peaceful informational activities must also be protected, as held in Concerned Consumers League vs. O'Neill.
The right to protest peacefully without falling foul of the law is a corresponding right that consumers ought to possess, just like sellers' right to commercial speech.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The appellants' manner of protest was peaceful and orderly. The criminal proceedings against them would be an abuse of process if allowed to continue. The appellants' case falls within the sweep, scope, and ambit of exception 9 to Section 499.
Peaceful pamphleteering has been recognized as a form of communication protected by the first amendment in the United States. Consumer organizations have access to consumers via advertising, and peaceful informational activities must also be protected.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated 10.06.2024 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay are set aside. Consequently, the complaint in CC No. 2042/SS/2016 pending on the file of the Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Borivali, Mumbai along with the order dated 04.10.2016 issuing summons to the appellants under Section 500 read with Section 34 of the IPC would stand quashed and set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the interpretation of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, specifically regarding the interplay between sub-sections (1) and (2). The Supreme Court notes that there are multiple decisions with inconsistent principles and conflicting views on the matter. The court mentions specific cases such as Karmi, Tulsamma, Thota Sesharathamma, Masilamani Mudaliar, Shakuntala Devi, Gumpha, Bhura, Sadhu Singh, Gaddam Ramakrishnareddy, Jagan Singh, Shivdev Kaur, Ranvir Dewan, and Jogi Ram.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The Supreme Court argues that the interpretation of Section 14 should be holistic and take into account all relevant principles. The court notes that if Section 14(1) is applied in cases where a testamentary disposition takes effect after the Act, it would make Sections 30 and 14(2) redundant or otiose. The court also argues that such an interpretation cannot be accepted as it contradicts the express language of the statute.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observes that there is a discordant note in certain decisions, specifically mentioning Karmi, Bhura, and Gumpha, but notes that these cases have not been clearly overruled. The court also mentions that the subsequent decisions have followed the idea in Karmi but enunciated different principles.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court directs the Registry to place its order along with the appeal paper book before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for constituting an appropriate larger bench. The court aims to reconcile the principles laid down in various judgments and restate the law on the interplay between sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the investigation of multiple criminal cases against a complainant and the subsequent allegations made against certain accused persons, including public officers. The alleged incident pertains to the period of 1999-2000.
Accused Nos.1, 3, and 4 have since passed away. The proceedings now survive solely against accused Nos.2 and 5.
Both accused No.2 and accused No.5 retired from service long ago on attaining the age of superannuation; accused No.2 superannuated in the year 2015 and is presently 71 years of age, while accused No.5 retired in the year 2020 and is now 64 years old.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented in this case revolves around the statutory protection afforded to public officers under Section 197 of the CrPC and Section 170 of the Police Act.
It was argued that even if the acts alleged may have exceeded the strict bounds of official duty, the safeguard of obtaining prior sanction from the competent authority cannot be rendered nugatory.
The prosecution's case was challenged on the grounds that the learned VII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate erred in taking cognisance of the alleged offences against the accused persons without the requisite sanction for prosecution.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
Observations were made regarding the statutory protection afforded to public officers and the requirement for obtaining prior sanction from the competent authority before initiating criminal proceedings.
The court noted that a mere excess or overreach in the performance of official duty does not, by itself, disentitle a public servant from the statutory protection mandated by law.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Hon'ble Court allowed the appeal and quashed the summoning order dated 07.05.2016 passed by the learned VII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru against accused Nos.2 and 5, as well as the order dated 11.06.2020 passed by the learned LXI City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru City in affirming the same.
The court held that no meaningful purpose would be served by prolonging the criminal prosecution against accused Nos.2 and 5, who had both retired from service long ago on attaining the age of superannuation.
Consequently, the impugned order dated 17.03.2021 passed by the High Court in Criminal Petition No.4512 of 2020 was set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a disgorgement order dated 28.09.2018 passed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The appellants, including VCL and other entities, were held to have indulged in fraudulent acts and transactions. They had filed an appeal against the disgorgement order before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).
The SAT set aside the disgorgement order, but also directed SEBI to pay costs of ₹2,00,000/- each to the appellants.
SEBI challenged the SAT's judgment before the Supreme Court.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
SEBI argued that the disgorgement order was valid and should not have been set aside by the SAT. They also argued that the direction for restitution by the Tribunal in its judgment dated 02.08.2019 was not justified.
The appellants, on the other hand, argued that the disgorgement order was unsustainable in law and that SEBI had no jurisdiction to pass such an order.
SEBI also argued that as only 4 entities out of 22 filed appeals against the disgorgement order, it could not be invalidated against those who had not chosen to file any appeal.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the entire exercise undertaken by SEBI after the passing of the final order dated 31.07.2014 was unsustainable in law.
The court also noted that the compensation claim of Ram Kishori Gupta and Harishchandra Gupta against SEBI stood decided by the Tribunal’s order dated 30.04.2013, which also attained finality.
The court further observed that the directions of the WTM's of SEBI in the orders dated 16.12.2014 and 01.04.2016, culminating in the direction for restitution by the Tribunal in its judgment dated 02.08.2019, cannot be sustained.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed Civil Appeal No. 7941 of 2019 and set aside the judgment dated 02.08.2019 passed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai in Appeal No. 44 of 2019.
The court also held that the direction for restitution by the Tribunal was unsustainable in law.
Additionally, the court noted that SEBI's attack against the Tribunal’s judgment dated 20.12.2021 on the score of the disgorgement order was devoid of merit.
However, the court set aside the direction of the Tribunal to mulct SEBI with exorbitant costs payable to the appellants.
Finally, the court ordered the parties to bear their own costs.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the rights of domestic workers in India. Ajay Malik and Ashok Kumar, accused of exploiting a complainant on the pretext of securing her employment as a domestic worker, challenged their convictions in the High Court. The Supreme Court was approached by both the accused and the State to consider the validity of the High Court's orders.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that their rights were violated during the investigation and trial process. They claimed that they were not given a fair opportunity to defend themselves, and that the evidence against them was tainted by police misconduct.
The State also challenged the acquittal of the accused, arguing that there was sufficient evidence to convict them of exploiting the complainant.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the rights of domestic workers in India require attention. The court noted that domestic workers often face exploitation and abuse, and that they need protection under the law.
The court also highlighted the need for a legal framework to protect the rights of domestic workers. It suggested that the government consider introducing legislation to address this issue.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed Ajay Malik's appeal and set aside the High Court's judgment, quashing all proceedings against him. The court also dismissed the State's appeal against Ashok Kumar's acquittal, upholding the High Court's order.
The court directed the Ministry of Labour and Employment to constitute a committee to consider recommending a legal framework for protecting the rights of domestic workers.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the custodial death of a person named Shama @ Kalya. The police had taken him into custody, and he was allegedly tortured to death in their custody. The court heard evidence from several witnesses, including Deepak Lokhande (PW-8), who allegedly impersonated Shama on 24.12.1995.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution argued that the police had willfully breached regulations and caused unwarrantable personal violence to Shama, resulting in his death. The appellants claimed that Shama had escaped from their custody and denied any involvement in his disappearance or death.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the police had failed to take adequate measures to prevent custodial torture and deaths. The absence of a mandatory judicial inquiry into such cases was also noted. The National Police Commission's recommendation for such an inquiry remains unimplemented. The court also highlighted the need for organizational accountability within the police department.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court maintained the convictions and sentences of the appellants, confirming their conviction under Section 304 Part-II IPC read with Section 34 IPC. The court rejected the benefit of doubt granted by the learned brother, upholding the conviction on sufficient evidence adduced to prove custodial torture.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant obtained a consent decree in their favour, asserting pre-existing rights to the subject land. The Collector of Stamps determined stamp duty for the subject land as per Article 22 of Schedule IA of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, which pertains to conveyance. However, the court held that the consent decree does not fall under the instruments mentioned in the Schedule and only asserts pre-existing rights.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main arguments presented by the appellant include:

* The consent decree is an assertion of pre-existing rights and does not create any new rights.
* The document pertaining to mutation of the subject land is not liable for stamp duty.
* The Collector's determination of stamp duty was incorrect as it pertains to conveyance, which is not applicable in this case.

The respondent/collector presented arguments that:

* Stamp duty is payable on the consent decree as per Article 22 of Schedule IA of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.
* The consent decree operates as a conveyance and requires payment of stamp duty.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:

* The consent decree only asserts pre-existing rights and does not transfer any new rights.
* The Collector's determination of stamp duty was incorrect and the document pertaining to mutation is not liable for stamp duty.
* The respondent/collector's arguments were based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the consent decree.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

* The consent decree does not fall under the instruments mentioned in the Schedule and only asserts pre-existing rights.
* No stamp duty is payable on the document pertaining to mutation of the subject land.
* The impugned order passed by the High Court was set aside, and the authority concerned shall make mutation of the revenue records in respect of the subject land in favour of the appellant.

The court further directed that:

* There is no order as to costs.
* Connected Miscellaneous Petition(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a criminal proceeding instituted against an appellant for offences under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The appeal is filed to quash the impugned proceedings. The FIR was registered in Crime No. 13 of 1998, and the case is pending before the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's counsel argued that the prosecution is manifestly frivolous or vexatious, as multiple FIRs have been registered against the accused over a period of time. The counsel contended that this raises the issue of wreaking vengeance out of private or personal grudge.

The counsel also relied on various precedents of the Supreme Court, which emphasize the court's duty to look into the FIR closely and with care when challenged by the accused. These precedents highlight the importance of scrutinizing the FIR for necessary ingredients to constitute the alleged offence and considering attending circumstances emerging from the record of the case.

Furthermore, the counsel pointed out that there is no provision in the statute fixing vicarious liability on office bearers of a body corporate like the appellant. Therefore, the prosecution's reliance on such vicarious liability is misplaced.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that when an accused challenges the FIR as manifestly frivolous or vexatious, the court owes a duty to look into the FIR with care and a little more closely.

The court also noted that in cases where multiple FIRs have been registered against an accused over time, it raises the issue of wreaking vengeance out of private or personal grudge. This requires the court to consider attending circumstances leading to the initiation/registration of the case as well as materials collected in the course of investigation.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned criminal proceedings instituted against the appellant for offences under Section 420 of the IPC.

The court held that since multiple FIRs have been registered against the accused, it raises the issue of wreaking vengeance out of private or personal grudge. This, combined with the lack of provision in the statute fixing vicarious liability on office bearers of a body corporate like the appellant, makes the prosecution manifestly frivolous or vexatious.

Accordingly, Criminal Case No. 7489 of 2002 arising out of Crime No. 13 of 1998 pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad is quashed.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Shri H.L. Khera, the then General Manager, HMT Watch Factory, Srinagar. The respondents were accused of entering into a criminal conspiracy to strike terror in the minds of the general public and compelling the Government to release their associates.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The prosecution case centered around the confessional statement of Mohd. Salim Zargar (respondent No. 2) recorded by Shri A.K. Suri (PW-3). However, this statement was rejected in Criminal Appeal No. 1681/2009.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the procedural safeguards for recording confessional statements were not followed in this case. The statements were recorded in a BSF camp or JIC, which cannot be considered a free atmosphere. The court also noted that the Legislature had reposed great faith in higher police officials while conferring the power of recording confessional statements, but in this case, the procedural safeguards were given a complete go-bye.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Special Court acquitted the respondents for the offences under Section 3(1) of the TADA Act read with Sections 120B, 302, 368 and 364 of the RPC. The court upheld this decision in the present criminal appeal, stating that no other view is possible.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around a dispute where the Tribunal assumed jurisdiction and gave directions that were legally untenable. The facts of the case are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that there was a dispute related to environmental issues or development.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The main argument presented by the parties is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the context and the arguments presented by the judges, it appears that the issue at hand is whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to assume jurisdiction and give directions related to environmental issues or development.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:

* The "Precautionary Principle" and the "Polluter Pays Principle" are part of Indian environmental law.
* The right to clean environment is a guaranteed fundamental right under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, while the right to development through industrialization equally claims priority under fundamental rights.
* There is a need for "Sustainable Development" harmonizing and striking a golden balance between the right to development and the right to clean environment.
* The concept of sustainable development is an integral part of "life" under Article 21.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court held that:

* The Tribunal had committed gross error in assuming jurisdiction and giving directions that were untenable in law.
* No substantial question relating to the environment had arisen, nor was there any violation of enactments specified in Schedule-I alleged.
* Therefore, the impugned Orders passed by the Tribunal are without jurisdiction and legally untenable, and deserve to be quashed and set aside.

The judgment concludes with the appeals being allowed accordingly.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case revolves around the misuse of Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. by unscrupulous litigants for achieving ulterior motives. The court references a previous decision in Priyanka Srivastava (supra) where it was held that applications under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C. are to be supported by an affidavit duly sworn by the complainant who seeks the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The court argues that the changes introduced by Section 175(3) of the BNSS merely codify the procedural practices and safeguards which have been introduced by judicial decisions aimed at curbing the misuse of invocation of powers of a Magistrate by unscrupulous litigants for achieving ulterior motives.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observes that prior to the filing of a petition under Section 156(3)Cr.P.C., there have to be applications under Sections 154(1) and 154(3)Cr.P.C. This is aimed at ensuring that persons making the application are conscious and do not make false affidavits, thereby deterring them from casually invoking the authority of the Magistrate.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court holds that this appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. The order passed by the Magistrate directing police investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. is also set aside.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The appellant, a District Town Planner in the Enforcement Division, carried out a demolition of a construction put up by the first respondent.
The demolition was done under the orders of superior authorities and as part of the performance of official duties.
An application was filed seeking regularization of the construction before another department, but this did not prevent the demolition from being carried out.
A complaint was filed against the appellant for carrying out the demolition without authority, but no prior order of sanction was obtained under Section 197 of the CrPC.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The learned counsel for the first respondent argued that when an application for regularization was pending, the appellant had no authority to demolish the construction.
However, this argument did not impress the court as there was sufficient basis for carrying out the demolition and it was done under orders from superior authorities.
The appellant's action of carrying out the demolition cannot be termed as "excess".
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the first respondent should have sought sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of the CrPC in this case.
Since no prior order of sanction was obtained, the initiation of the criminal proceeding against the appellant is vitiated.
Consequently, the summoning order and subsequent steps taken by the Trial Court are liable to be quashed.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeals and disposed of them as follows:
The summoning order and consequent steps taken by the Trial Court are quashed.
However, liberty is reserved for the first respondent to take steps in accordance with law and seek an order of sanction.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint filed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The complainant is a student in higher secondary school, and he alleges that the accused, his teacher, was making unwanted advances and pressuring him not to lodge a report.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The High Court had quashed the FIR No.6/2022 and all further proceedings on the ground that the accused and the complainant had settled the matter. However, the Supreme Court held that in cases of this nature, a compromise between the parties cannot be a ground to abruptly terminate the investigation.
The Supreme Court relied on two decisions: Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012) and Laxmi Narayan Bajranglal Pannu v. State of Haryana (1991). In these cases, it was held that the power under Section 482, Cr.P.C. could not be used to quash proceedings based on a compromise if it is in respect of heinous offences which are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Supreme Court observed that the accused had made pressure on the complainant not to lodge any report, despite this, within a couple of weeks, the accused managed to compromise the case with the complainant and his wife. The court also noted that the fact that in view of the compromise entered into between the parties, the chance of conviction is remote and bleak cannot be a ground to abruptly terminate the investigation.
The Supreme Court further observed that in cases of this nature, deterrence to others committing similar offences is a must and they cannot get a signal that anything and everything can be compromised. 
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned order dated 04.02.2022 of the High Court in S.B.C.R.M.P. No.1348/2022, quashing the FIR No.6/2022 and all further proceedings pursuant thereto. The court directed that the FIR No.6/2022, investigation and criminal proceedings pursuant thereto be proceeded with against the accused in accordance with law.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<Facts>
The petitioner, a former judge of the High Court, claimed pensionary benefits after his retirement on August 26, 2002. The petitioner had held judicial office for over ten years and was also a member of the Bar for over fourteen years and eight months prior to his appointment as a Judge of the High Court.
</Facts>

<ARGUMENTS>
The petitioner's argument was based on the judgment of this Court in Union of India vs Justice (Retd) Raj Rahul Garg, where it was held that Judges drawn from various sources should not be discriminated against. The petitioner argued that he should be given the benefit of an addition of ten years of service under Section 14A, similar to Judges appointed from the Bar.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The Court noted that accepting the Union's submission would discriminate against Judges of the High Court based on their source of appointment. The Court observed that a member of the Bar is entitled to the addition of ten years of service by virtue of Section 14A, and this principle should be applied uniformly to all Judges.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Court directed that the pensionary payments due to the petitioner be recomputed after giving him the benefit of an addition of ten years of service. However, it clarified that the maximum basic pension payable to a Judge of the High Court (Rs 13,50,000 per annum) shall continue to apply to the petitioner. The difference in pensionary payments should be computed with effect from the date of his retirement within three months, and the arrears due and payable in terms of the order should be paid over by March 31, 2025.

<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves the imposition of a penalty on liquor shops in various districts of a state. The single Judge and Division Bench had adopted different approaches to determine whether the amended Rule 19, which reduced the penalty from four times the duty to the value of the duty, could be applied retrospectively.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the amendment by substitution had the effect of repealing the law existing as on the date of repeal. However, this approach was found to have limitations. On the other hand, the Division Bench held that levy of penalty is substantive law and cannot operate retrospectively.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court observed that the substituted penalty only mollified the rigor of the law by reducing the penalty from four times the duty to the value of the duty. Therefore, the bar of Article 20(1) of imposing a penalty greater than the one in force at the time of commission of the offence had no application.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The Supreme Court allowed the appeals and set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court. The court held that the amended Rule 19 would be applicable to proceedings that have commenced with the issuance of the demand notice in November, 2011. The penalty to be imposed on the appellants will be on the basis of Rule 19 as substituted on 29.03.2011.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves a complaint conveyed by the District Magistrate, Ramban to the Special Judge, NIA on 20.09.2019, and the investigation stood completed with the filing of the chargesheet on 25.09.2019. The appointed day for the Act, 2019 was 31.10.2019.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant's submission that there is no need for getting the appropriate sanction or empowerment as mandated under Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 cannot be countenanced. The Order, 2019 did not indicate a retrospective application of CrPC, 1973. Para 2(13) confers sufficient power on the investigating agency to deal with such situations.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The High Court of Calcutta's reasoning in Nibaran Chandra (supra) is followed, and it is held that while an investigation could continue after its initiation under CrPC, 1989 by way of the application of CrPC, 1973, it cannot be stated that even for a case where there was a clear non-compliance of the former, it can be ignored by the application of the latter.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The impugned judgment is set aside insofar as it confirms the judgment of the Special Judge, NIA, in not taking cognizance for the offence punishable under Section 120-B of the RPC, 1989. Liberty is given to the appellant to comply with the mandate of Section 196-A of CrPC, 1989 by seeking appropriate authorization or empowerment as the case may be. If such compliance is duly made, then the Trial Court shall undertake the exercise of taking cognizance and proceed further with the trial in accordance with law.

The case involves a dispute over the registration of a sale deed for immovable property. The sale deed was executed in 1985 and presented for registration, but it did not contain the signatures of all parties involved. The defendants (respondents) are contesting the registration of the sale deed, while the plaintiff (appellant) is seeking its registration.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellant argued that:
- The sale deed was executed in 1985, and at that time, there was no requirement under law for the vendee to sign the document of sale.
- The absence of signatures from certain parties does not render the sale deed invalid.

The respondents (defendants) argued that:
- The sale deed did not contain the signatures of all parties involved, which is a necessary condition for its registration.
- Various judgments were cited in support of their argument.

The court also considered arguments related to the requirement of signatures and photographs on sale deeds, as introduced by section 32A of the Act, 1908 in 2001, and whether this provision applies retrospectively or prospectively.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that:
- The cases relied upon by the respondents are distinguishable from the facts of the present case.
- The sale deed was executed before 2001, when section 32A was introduced, and there was no requirement under law for the vendee to sign the document of sale at that time.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court. The first Appellate Court's decree in favor of the appellant was restored, and the registering authority was directed to score out the sale deed from the records. Exemplary costs of Rs. 10,00,000 were awarded to be paid by each respondent within eight weeks.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>

<START CASE>
<FACTS>
The case involves two appeals filed by the appellants against the orders of the High Court and the Trial Courts. The accused persons were involved in the dealing with certain substances that are mentioned under the Schedule to the NDPS Act but absent from Schedule I of the NDPS Rules. The High Court and the Trial Courts had held that no offence under the provisions of the NDPS Act was made out.
</FACTS>

<ARGUMENTS>
The appellants argued that the decision in Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra) must be given retrospective effect, which would mean that the dealing with substances mentioned under the Schedule to the NDPS Act but absent from Schedule I of the NDPS Rules is an offence.
</ARGUMENTS>

<OBSERVATIONS>
The court observed that the Trial Courts could not discharge/delete the charge under the NDPS Act framed against the accused persons while disposing of an application under Section 216 CrPC, as this is not permissible within our criminal procedure. The High Court failed to take notice of this aspect.
</OBSERVATIONS>

<JUDGMENT>
The court allowed both the appeals filed by the appellants and set aside the impugned orders passed by the High Court. The Trial Courts are directed to proceed with the trial and conclude it expeditiously. The accused concerned in both the appeals are directed to be tried by the concerned Special Judge, NDPS, in accordance with law.
</JUDGMENT>
<END CASE>
